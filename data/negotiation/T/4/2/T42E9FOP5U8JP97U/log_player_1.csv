Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $120, but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so he's likely to counteroffer.  This sets up a back-and-forth that can lead to a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  There's still room for negotiation, and you could potentially reach a compromise that benefits both of you.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more on this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That way we both get a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $125 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to your minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only take longer and may not result in a significantly better price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
