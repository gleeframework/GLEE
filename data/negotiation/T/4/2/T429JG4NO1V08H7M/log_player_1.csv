Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a starting offer that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also indicates a willingness to compromise, which can make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $140 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $155? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $155 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue negotiating, John is offering me my minimum price, so it's more efficient to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
