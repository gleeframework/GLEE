Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to the product's worth to me ($100) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  I know Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but doesn't give away too much profit.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $100 from John, so I don't need to go below that. 

By offering the product at $99, I leave a small margin for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and close to my own."
