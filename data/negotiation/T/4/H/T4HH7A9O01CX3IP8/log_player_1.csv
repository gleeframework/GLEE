Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that profit margin as possible without pushing Bob to reject your offer. A good strategy is to start high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" subtly emphasize the product's worth.
* **Strong Opening Price:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It captures a significant portion of the potential profit for you.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While high, the price leaves Bob some wiggle room if he wants to negotiate, making him feel more in control.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still staying above your $1,000,000 minimum."
