I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob! $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? That seems fair considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 115}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $112 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll send another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go back to my previous offer of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while he's been willing to compromise, we haven't been able to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate, we'll run out of time and I won't be able to get a price that's fair to me. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
