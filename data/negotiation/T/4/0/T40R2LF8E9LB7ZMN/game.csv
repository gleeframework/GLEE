"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $850,000, reflecting the value you'll gain from this product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and should be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle around $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
