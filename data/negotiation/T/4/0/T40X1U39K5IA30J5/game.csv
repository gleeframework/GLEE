"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $11,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I respect your budget constraints.  However, $13,000 undervalues the product's features and benefits.  To find a middle ground, I propose $16,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures you receive exceptional value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair offer considering we're both making concessions.",14000.0,Bob,6,
