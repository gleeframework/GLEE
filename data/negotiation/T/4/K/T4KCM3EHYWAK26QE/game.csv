"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I consider fair. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,050,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. To meet you closer to your offer, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my eagerness to do business with you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no further. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
