Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I consider fair. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,050,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

We're still a ways off from my bottom line, and I'm willing to see if Bob will budge further. It's too early to settle for $950,000 when I have John as a backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. To meet you closer to your offer, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my eagerness to do business with you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no further. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob is clearly anchored at a much lower price point, and we're unlikely to bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
