"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,250?"", ""product_price"": 7250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $7,250 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $7,875. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to come down significantly further, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might save a small amount, but it also risks getting stuck with no deal and having to buy from John anyway."
