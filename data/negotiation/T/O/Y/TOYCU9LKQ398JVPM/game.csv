"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $7,250 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $7,875. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",7875.0,Alice,5,
