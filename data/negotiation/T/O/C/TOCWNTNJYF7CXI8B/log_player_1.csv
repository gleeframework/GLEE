I'm offering Bob the product for $1,450,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than what John is offering, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a good profit. I believe this price is fair and reasonable considering Bob's willingness to pay more than $1,300,000."
