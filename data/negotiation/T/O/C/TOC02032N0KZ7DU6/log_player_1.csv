Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategic aspects:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I know you're interested in acquiring this product and I'm confident it can bring you significant value. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to gain a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit, Minimize Risk:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without pushing him away. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Knowing we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John gives us leverage. We don't need to desperately lowball, but we also shouldn't be greedy.
* **Clear and Confident Communication:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and presents the price as a strategic investment rather than just a number.

**Why this price?**

* It's a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* It leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain (his value - your price). While not huge, it's enough to incentivize him.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might counter-offer, or he might be comfortable walking away. This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential gain and securing the sale."
