"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  It's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price. While I understand your position, $775,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $825,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
