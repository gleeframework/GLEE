"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within a budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm glad we're closer to my budget. However, I believe we could still negotiate further. Would you consider $95 as a fair price for the product?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think I can do $110. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",110.0,Alice,5,
