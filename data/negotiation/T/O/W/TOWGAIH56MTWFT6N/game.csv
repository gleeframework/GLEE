"I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you, and I think you'll find it's a great value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $15,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still outside of my budget. As I mentioned, I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is the next best price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's try to close this gap.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, and I think this price is the closest we can get to a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,7,
