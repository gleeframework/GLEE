"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but within a range that might still be appealing to him, considering the potential value to him.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm trying to be friendly and open a conversation, not just making a blunt offer. This might encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the value to Bob to make him think about the potential benefits of buying. 

I'm aiming to get a good starting price and see how Bob reacts. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not going to settle for such a low price yet.  

I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired value.  It's a calculated risk, as I could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial positions. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to reinforce the attractiveness of the offer.
* **Set a Clear Limit:** I'm clearly stating my minimum acceptable price to avoid wasting time on further negotiation at a lower price point.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, as it's a fair price considering his perceived value. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiations, but I won't go lower than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to settle for less, especially considering John is willing to pay my full asking price.  

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to encourage Bob to come up a bit further.  If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as the potential risk of losing both buyers is increasing."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $14,250, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down a bit from my previous offer, but still maintaining a price point above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a compromise and a fair middle ground, which might make Bob feel more motivated to accept.
* **Maintain Pressure:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly putting pressure on him to consider the offer. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. If not, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still consider it to be too low. I have already made several compromises and shown flexibility, but it's important for me to maintain my value and try to reach a price closer to my target.

Since John is ready to pay my full asking price, I'm not willing to settle for much less, even if it means risking losing Bob as a buyer. I will try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,750 is still a bit too low for me. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $14,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's the best I can do at this point. If you're truly interested, I believe this is a great deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final compromise by lowering my price to $14,000. This is closer to Bob's offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** I'm highlighting that this is a significant compromise from my previous offer to show Bob that I'm genuinely trying to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him to encourage him to consider my offer.

I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob.  If not, I'll have no choice but to accept John's offer in the next round, as I can't afford to lose any more time and potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13,200. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I've reached my limit.  I've made several compromises and shown a willingness to negotiate, but Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  

I'm running out of time and risking losing both buyers.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale with John.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I can't afford to keep negotiating indefinitely.  John's offer guarantees me a fair price and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all."
