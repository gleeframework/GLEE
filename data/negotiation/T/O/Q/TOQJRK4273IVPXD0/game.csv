"Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $820,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $790,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
