"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room to negotiate, but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000,  which is still above Bob's last offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  This should keep the deal alive while still pushing for a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful we can get a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time,  showing flexibility and that I'm willing to get closer to his price point.  The goal is to reach a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm taking Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John.  The risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a deal falling apart.  This feels like a good point to secure a decent profit."
