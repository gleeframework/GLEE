"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm looking for $18,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is too high for his budget, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,500 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has already shown that he's willing to walk away, and Alice is showing signs of being willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,500, but I'm still a little too high.  I'm firm on $15,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is my final offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already shown he's willing to walk away and has a backup option with John. At this point, he can try to get closer to his ideal price, potentially through a counteroffer or by seeing if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on $16,000, but I'm still hoping we can find a solution closer to $15,500.  Would you consider $15,750?  It's a small step closer to your number and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to budge much further, but I'm willing to meet you at $16,200. This is a compromise, and I think it's the best we can do. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. While Alice has come down a bit, she's still above Bob's ideal price.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is that he might not be able to get a lower price and could end up losing time and the opportunity to buy the product from John.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product for his target price and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
