"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. I propose to sell the product to you for $95. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $95
* **Your Value:** $100
* **Alice's Value:** $80
* **John's Price:** $100

You can get the product from John for $100, which is your maximum value. Alice's offer is $95, which is still a good deal for you, but you can get it for less by rejecting her offer and buying from John."
