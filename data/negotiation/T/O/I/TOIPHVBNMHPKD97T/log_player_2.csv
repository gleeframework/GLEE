Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to get at least $150 for this.  It's the lowest I can go.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is still above your maximum budget of $100.  You've already made two counteroffers, and it seems like she's unwilling to budge much further.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $100 and avoid further negotiation."
