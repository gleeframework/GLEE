"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my asking price.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I see the potential value in this product, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider $1,400,000 as a starting point.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers.  However, we're still a fair bit apart. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a significant investment on my end, but I believe in the mutual benefit this product will bring.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,650,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,525,000.  This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
