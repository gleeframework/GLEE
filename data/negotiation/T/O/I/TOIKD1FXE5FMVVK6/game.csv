"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're committed to your price of $1,250,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still out of my range.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1,275,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need you to throw in some extras to make it worth my while. I'm thinking a 2-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package. If you're willing to do that, I can meet you at $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
