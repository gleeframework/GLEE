"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price, knowing that Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, giving Bob a chance to counter without feeling pressured to accept right away.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and encouraging message sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to counter and see if we can reach a more favorable price. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $150 from John gives me the flexibility to be more aggressive in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Appealing to fairness:**  Framing it as ""finding a middle ground"" suggests a cooperative approach.
* **Staying above my floor:**  $160 is still higher than John's offer, so I'm not losing out on value by negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140. This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $140 is still below my $150 floor, and I've already made two concessions. 
* **John's offer is a secure alternative:**  I have a guaranteed $150 from John, which is higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Time is limited:** I only have 6 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate with Bob might risk losing John's offer. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
