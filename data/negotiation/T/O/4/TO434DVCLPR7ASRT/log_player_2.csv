"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer.  $140 is still too high for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I really want to make a deal with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price for me. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, so I'll accept her offer."
