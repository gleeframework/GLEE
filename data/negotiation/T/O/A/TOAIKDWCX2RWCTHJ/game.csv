"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $200. Is that something you'd be interested in?",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll sell it to you for $175. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",175.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a decent profit. I'll sell it to you for $165. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $140, so I'll offer $155. Can you consider that?",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $165. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm afraid I'm going to have to draw the line at $165. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",165.0,Alice,7,
