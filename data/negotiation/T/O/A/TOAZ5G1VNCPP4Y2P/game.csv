"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Would you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. What do you think?"

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we try to find a middle ground closer to my initial offer? Would you be willing to consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway between $10,000 and $18,000, which is $14,000. What do you think?"
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,,
