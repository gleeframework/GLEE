"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential aims to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the value beyond the initial price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** My message implies I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Safety Net:**  While I'm aiming high, I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Above My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** Rejecting his offer will show him I'm serious about getting a better price and gauge his true interest level."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $950,000?  This price reflects the product's true value, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** $950,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" making it sound more appealing.
* **Keeping Option Open:** This still leaves room to move slightly if necessary, but I'm closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher amount. $920,000 is not a significant enough increase from his previous offer to warrant accepting it.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:**  By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how committed Bob is to acquiring the product and how much higher he's willing to go.
* **Avoiding a ""Settling"" Mentality:**  Accepting his offer now might lead to a feeling of settling for less than I believe the product is worth.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I have the option to sell to John if negotiations fail, so I can afford to be slightly more assertive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges your concerns and still reflects the value of the product.  I'm open to finalizing a deal at this point.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my counteroffer slightly.
* **Finalizing Deal:**  My message indicates I'm ready to close the deal at this price, putting pressure on Bob to respond. 
* **Fair Price:**  I'm reaffirming that $940,000 is a fair price for both parties, reinforcing my position.
* **Openness:** I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm signaling that I'm nearing my limit.
* **Minimizing Risk:** With only a few rounds left, this counteroffer gives me a decent chance of closing the deal while avoiding the risk of ending up with John's lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $940000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate where Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm still confident that I can get a higher price. Bob's repeated rejection shows that he values the product, and there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, it's not ideal. I have a few more rounds to try and push for a better deal.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while maintaining a firm position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $930,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, demonstrating flexibility while staying firm on the value of the product.
* **Fairness:**  I'm reiterating the fairness of the offer for both of us.
* **Closing the Deal:**  My message focuses on closing the deal, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Remaining Options:** I still have the option to sell to John if Bob rejects, but I'm trying to maximize my profit within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the value of the product, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $930000. I'm willing to pay $910000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to the last two rounds, and the time pressure is significant. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer is lower than my previous offer and shows a lack of willingness to meet my price.
* **Risk of Lower Price:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter, I risk ending up with a lower price in the final round, or Bob might walk away entirely.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and provides a safe and secure outcome.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, the risk of losing a deal altogether in the final round is too high. Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit and avoids potential losses."
