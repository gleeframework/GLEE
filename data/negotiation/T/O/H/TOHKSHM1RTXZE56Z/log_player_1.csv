Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price given my current budget and the value you've outlined.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This shows my seriousness in acquiring this product, and it's a significant move from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
