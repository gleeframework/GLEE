"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially setting the price at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,200,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering.  John is offering the product for $1,000,000, so Bob knows there is room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I'm confident in the true worth of this product and its potential for you.  I could come down to $1,120,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it holds. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,120,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still do better.  John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to John's."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position and value the product's potential. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This shows my seriousness in acquiring this product, and it's a significant move from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000? This reflects the product's value while recognizing your investment.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his ideal price.  John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for Bob.  Rather than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially end up with a higher price, Bob is better off securing the product from John at the lower cost."
