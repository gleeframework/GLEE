Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer it for $150, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. This way, I still make a significant profit over his perceived value ($80) while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. He might try to haggle the price down, and I can always meet him somewhere in the middle. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
