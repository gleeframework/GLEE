Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price for this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try to meet each other halfway from $1300000? That would be $1200000 for me and $1400000 for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good compromise and is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000."
