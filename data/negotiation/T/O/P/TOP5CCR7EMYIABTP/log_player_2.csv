"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer aims low to see how much bargaining room there is. It's still above Alice's valuation, leaving space for negotiation while trying to secure a good discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to her minimum, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It seems like we're getting closer, Alice. How about $118?"",
""product_price"": 118
}
```

We're splitting the difference between her offer ($125) and our last counter ($110). This shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I can go down to $122, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small, and we risk her walking away. Accepting at $122 is a good deal compared to John's $150 price."
