# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product warrants a price closer to $1600000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to gain from this transaction. Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us.
