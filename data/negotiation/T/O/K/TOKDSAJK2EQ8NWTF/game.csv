"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product,  $1750000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and my current financial capacity.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I believe the value of this product warrants a price closer to $1600000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to gain from this transaction. Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. However, $1600000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1550000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, and I'm hopeful you'll consider my offer.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
