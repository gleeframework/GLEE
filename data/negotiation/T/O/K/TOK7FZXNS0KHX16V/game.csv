"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $1000000. Would it be possible for you to consider a price closer to this amount?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $1350000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, given my budget constraints, I am still unable to reach $1350000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
