"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,250 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Could we possibly agree on $10,000 even?  I think that's a fair offer considering it's your ideal price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
