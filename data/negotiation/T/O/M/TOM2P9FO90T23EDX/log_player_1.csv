"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $75 is better than selling to John for $80,  I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $95. I'll try to negotiate with Bob and see if I can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85, which would be $80. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is the same price as I could sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking losing the deal to John. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum desired price and close the deal."
