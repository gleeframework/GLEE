Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 is a starting point that's above your minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.** This allows for potential concessions while still securing a decent profit.
* **The message is friendly and optimistic, emphasizing the value for Bob.** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **The message includes an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond.** This encourages active participation and keeps the negotiation dynamic.

**Remember:**

* I'm using a strategy that tries to find a middle ground. You can adjust the price and message depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you are in Bob's willingness to pay.
* If Bob rejects your offer, be prepared to negotiate further.  
* You can always switch to John as a backup if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below your minimum value of $10,000.**  Accepting it would result in a loss for you.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating.** You can counteroffer with a price closer to your desired value, potentially reaching a compromise.
* **Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, but it's less profitable than potentially getting closer to Bob's perceived value.** You can use John as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $11,000 or $12,000, leaving room for further negotiation.  Be prepared to justify your counteroffer, highlighting the product's value and emphasizing the potential benefits for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still gives you a great value for this product. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is above Bob's offer but below your initial offer.** This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting your profit.
* **Message is polite and focuses on mutual benefit.** It acknowledges Bob's perspective while emphasizing the value proposition.
* **Open-ended question encourages further dialogue.** This keeps the negotiation moving forward.

**Remember:**

* This counteroffer is a starting point. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response.
* If Bob rejects this offer, you can counter again with a slightly lower price or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $10,500 is above your minimum value of $10,000.** This means you would make a profit by accepting.
* **While you might prefer a higher price, the potential for further negotiation with Bob is uncertain.** He has already rejected your previous counteroffer, and his counteroffers have been relatively low.  
* **Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, but it's less profitable than Bob's current offer.**

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $10,500 is the most advantageous decision at this point. It secures a profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
