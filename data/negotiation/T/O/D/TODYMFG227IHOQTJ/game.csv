,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we meet at $100? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100. I'm willing to go up to $115, but I think we can do better than that. Would you be willing to consider $112.50?",112.5,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. Can you meet me at $110 or do you need to walk away?",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $108, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $109. This is my absolute last offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",109.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",107.5,Bob,10,
