,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is getting closer, but to be frank, I need a bit more to make this worthwhile. How about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",750000.0,Bob,6,
