{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is getting closer, but to be frank, I need a bit more to make this worthwhile. How about we settle at $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

While $750,000 is tempting, we're getting close enough to my minimum that it's worth pushing a little further. Bob increasing his offer suggests he's still willing to negotiate."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000. How about we settle at $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a good deal!  Bob is meeting you exactly in the middle, showing a willingness to compromise. It's better to take a sure win now than risk pushing him too far and losing the deal."
