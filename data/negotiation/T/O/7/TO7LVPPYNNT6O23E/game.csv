"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of offering $12,000. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high for you. How about we settle for $13,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm keen to make this work for both of us.  However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250? This feels like a fair deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $12,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $12,250. Can we try $11,875?",11875.0,Bob,6,
