I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $10,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents an excellent investment for your needs. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $12,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might incentivize her to lower the price further."
