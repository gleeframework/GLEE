{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters.  I'm also being friendly and positive, which might help encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a good price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $115? "", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $115.  This is still above my minimum price and might be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $120. While I'm close to accepting his offer, I'd rather sell to John at $120."
