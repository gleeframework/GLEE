"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm looking to invest a bit lower. How about we bring the price down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $875,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
