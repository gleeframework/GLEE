"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $125?  I think this is fair for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $117.50.  Let's close this deal.",117.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $121.25?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",121.25,Alice,5,
