"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that benefits us both.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,600,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product, and I respect your approach.  While $1,600,000 is closer to the mark, I can't commit for less than $1,850,000.  I believe this offer represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a truly unique asset.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $1,850,000 is still beyond my means. Let's meet in the middle again - how about $1,700,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
