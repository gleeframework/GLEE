Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This is a good starting point. It's lower than what Bob is willing to pay, but still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while also ensuring you get a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible but still want to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a little more, $13,200 is a good price, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort.  It's significantly better than selling to John and gets me closer to my desired profit margin."
