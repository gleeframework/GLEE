Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to reach a deal, I'm willing to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price. I need to show Bob I'm serious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be frank, I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product. Would you consider $1,500,000? This shows movement on my end while still reflecting the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you see in the product, $1,500,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, but I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. I need to push him a bit further, but I'll concede a bit more this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1300000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer reflects my commitment to acquiring this product, but I can't go any higher. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,100,000 is a substantial profit margin, well above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other investments and opportunities. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out the negotiation further could lead to frustration or cause Bob to reduce his offer. 

Accepting this offer represents a solid win-win scenario."
