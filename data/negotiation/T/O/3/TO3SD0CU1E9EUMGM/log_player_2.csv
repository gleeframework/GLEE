# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be frank, I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product. Would you consider $1,500,000? This shows movement on my end while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand the value you see in the product, $1,500,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice's offer is still too high, but we are getting closer. I'm going to make another counteroffer, but if she doesn't budge further, I'll buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer reflects my commitment to acquiring this product, but I can't go any higher. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
