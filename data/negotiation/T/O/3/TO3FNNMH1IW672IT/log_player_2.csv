"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to let you have this amazing product for $140. It's a one-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. Alice is still making a profit at that price, so there might be room for negotiation."
