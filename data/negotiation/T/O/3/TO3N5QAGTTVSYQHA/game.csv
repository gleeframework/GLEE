"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price that allows me to make some profit while still being attractive to you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85. This represents a good deal for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
