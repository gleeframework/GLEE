"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about $850,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and our current negotiations."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and we risk her sticking to her $900,000 price or even retracting the offer. At $900,000, we're still saving $100,000 compared to John's price. It's a good deal and time to accept."
