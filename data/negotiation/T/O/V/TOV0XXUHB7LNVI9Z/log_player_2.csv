"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to save more money.  Since your goal is to save as much as possible, rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum value. This allows for potential negotiation and hopefully secures a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above my ideal price point. There's still room for further negotiation, and I can try to push for a lower price. Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy to maximize my savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is at the sweet spot. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay, but it's also the minimum Alice is likely to accept, given her minimum value for the product. This offer balances my desire to save money with the need to secure the deal before potentially losing it to John."
