Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is only $85,000 above your target of $800,000.  This is a relatively small difference, especially given the potential hassle of continuing to negotiate or buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without further negotiation."
