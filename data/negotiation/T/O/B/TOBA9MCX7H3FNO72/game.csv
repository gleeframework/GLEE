"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  Would you consider $1,150,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value you've placed on it at $800,000, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
