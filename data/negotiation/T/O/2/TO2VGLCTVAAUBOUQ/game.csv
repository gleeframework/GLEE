"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value and benefits you mentioned earlier.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1250000 is still a little below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's split the difference. How about $1300000?  This would be a good compromise and allow us to both walk away satisfied. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I need to see a bit more movement on your end. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
