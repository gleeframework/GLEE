"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start with a price of $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer of $130 for the product. This price reflects its value while being more accessible to you. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see, Bob. Let's try $128. This price is higher than your last offer but still reflects the value of the product. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $128. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125 again. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go. Can you consider this?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I've decided to accept $125 as a fair price for the product. Thank you for discussing this with me, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Alice,7,
