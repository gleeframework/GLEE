Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a reasonable markup from the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's also a price that Bob might be willing to pay, as the product is worth $800,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm offering Bob $850,000. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not comfortable accepting it yet, but I'll keep negotiating with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm offering Bob $825,000. This is a final compromise on my part, as it's only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price. I hope Bob will accept this offer, as I don't want to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've negotiated with Bob as much as I'm willing to. While his offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll sell the product to John for $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and will ensure I don't lose money on this deal."
