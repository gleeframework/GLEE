Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This gives me room to negotiate and gauge Bob's interest.  Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my desired price and significantly higher than what I could get from John. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to accept it."
