Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of great value."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have a strong position.  You can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By stating the product is worth at least $1,000,000 *to him*, you reinforce its value in Bob's mind.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $1,200,000 offer provides some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing you a higher price than John's offer. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  Factors like your relationship with Bob, your risk tolerance, and the nature of the product could influence a different offer."
