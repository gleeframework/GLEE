I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $300,000 is a substantial discount from her initial price.  This will help determine if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Alice seems to be stuck at her initial offer. I'm not willing to pay that much, and I'm running out of time. I'll make one more counteroffer, but if she rejects it, I'll buy from John."

Alice is not budging, and I'm out of time.  I'm better off buying from John. While I'm not thrilled about paying $1,000,000, it's better than getting stuck in a stalemate with Alice."
