"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly useful. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above my maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting allows me to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant concession. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives me another chance to negotiate a lower price.  I'm willing to risk another round to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which represents a significant compromise from my initial position.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a common ground. However, $900,000 is still not a viable option for me. I'm willing to go down to $925,000, but this is truly my final offer. Let's close this deal before we run out of time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my target. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again. There's a good chance Alice will need to close the deal and might be willing to go lower.  Plus, I'm not too far from my goal and have more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $912,500.  This is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value your persistence in finding a solution. While I appreciate your offer, $912,500 is still below my acceptable range. Let's aim for a final agreement. I'm offering $920,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can finalize this deal. Let's see if we can shake hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is getting very close to my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm now within a reasonable range and don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product rather than potentially going through more rounds and potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price."
