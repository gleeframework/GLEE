"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting slightly above Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more open to the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $135 is below my minimum of $150, but it's still a good starting point. I'm hoping to find a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  The 10-round limit will encourage Bob to move quickly. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me the confidence to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum of $150 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $120. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **John is a Backup:**  Knowing John is ready to pay $150 allows me to be patient and hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This still gives me a fair price for the product and allows us to make a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $125 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $100.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that $125 is a good deal for both of us.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go lower than $125. This shows that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Maintaining the Pressure:**  The message encourages Bob to respond quickly, reminding him of the limited rounds.
* **John is Still an Option:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $150, which is still better than $125."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference and make it $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While $112 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $150 minimum and significantly below the value I perceive the product to have.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I'm confident I can secure a better price through further negotiation.  Bob seems willing to negotiate, and I have a strong bargaining position with John's offer.
* **John Remains a Safety Net:**  Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome.  I'm willing to take a risk to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $112 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $118? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 118} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:**  Offering $118 shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my profit margin. 
* **Framing it Positively:**  ""Meet in the middle"" emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Strong Negotiation Position:**  My previous rejection of $112 shows I'm serious about getting a better price.
* **Maintaining Time Pressure:**  The limited rounds keep Bob motivated to close a deal.
* **John is Always an Option:**  I'm comfortable rejecting further offers if necessary, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
