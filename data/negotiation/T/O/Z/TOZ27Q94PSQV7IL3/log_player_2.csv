It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $1,700,000 is way over your budget."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget and potentially appealing to Alice as it's closer to her desired value.  We'll see how she responds."

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll try another counteroffer."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,400,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal. Hopefully, she sees it as a reasonable compromise."
