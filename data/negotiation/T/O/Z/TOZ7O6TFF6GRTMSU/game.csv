"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,650,000. I know this is a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, so this is a chance to acquire it at a slightly higher price than you'd pay elsewhere.  Think it over, and let me know if you're interested.",1650000.0,Alice,1,
