"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept the offer. There's no information about the product, and  it's likely Alice is trying to get the highest price possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm not sure I can go that high right now. Would you be willing to take $75 for it? "", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** Offering a lower price ($75)  demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price within my budget. 
* **Adding a message:**  Adding a friendly and encouraging message helps to build rapport and keep the negotiation positive. This can potentially lead to a better outcome. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $75 is a significant reduction, leaving space for further negotiation if Alice counters with a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $87.50?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.50 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming to save more. I can likely negotiate further and aim for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $87.50 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counter:**  I'm making a small, incremental counteroffer, showing Alice that I'm serious about negotiation but not drastically changing the price. 
* **Positive Message:**  Continuing a friendly and encouraging tone, reminding Alice of our shared goal to reach a deal.
* **Focusing on Fair Price:**  Emphasizing that $80 is a ""fair price"" helps position the offer as reasonable and makes it harder for Alice to reject without appearing unreasonable."
