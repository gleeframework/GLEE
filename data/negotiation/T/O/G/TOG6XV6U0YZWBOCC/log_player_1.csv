"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief justification for your price, even if it's emphasizing potential value, can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offered price of $2,200,000 leaves ample room for negotiation before reaching your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 or John's guaranteed offer.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving options open in this initial round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is a fair price given my assessment of its value.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is far too low.  While it's expected that he would start with a low offer, it doesn't make sense to accept a price that's less than what John is guaranteeing. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the significant potential this product offers and leaves room for a profitable partnership between us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** Lowering the price by $300,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's not a drastic drop that would make you seem desperate.
* **Reiterating Value:** Emphasizing the product's value again reminds Bob of the potential benefits, justifying the still-high price.
* **Aiming for Higher Ground:** The goal is to slowly move towards a price closer to your minimum while gauging how much Bob is willing to budge from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the potential I see in it.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has significantly increased, but it's still below John's guaranteed price. While it's tempting, we are still in the early stages of negotiation, and there's room to push for a better deal.  We'll continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your latest offer shows serious interest, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us.  To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,650,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  Recognizing Bob's increased offer builds goodwill and shows you're negotiating in good faith.
* **Significant Concession:**  Dropping the price by $250,000 is a substantial move that demonstrates your willingness to make a deal.
* **Above John's Offer:**  Crucially, this offer still keeps you above your safety net of $1,500,000 from John.
* **Compromise Language:** Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" helps position the offer as mutually beneficial. 

We're now getting closer to the later stages of negotiation, so it's important to balance concessions with maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, but it's still under John's guaranteed $1,500,000. With four rounds left, there's room to push a bit further and see if Bob is willing to meet or exceed John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate how we're working towards a fair deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,550,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my strong desire to finalize this agreement."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession, Above Guarantee:**  This offer strategically positions us just above John's guaranteed offer. It signals flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Urgency and Compromise:** Emphasizing your desire to finalize the deal and highlighting your compromise (even if small) can nudge Bob towards a decision. 

We are now entering a critical stage of the negotiation. It's crucial to balance pushing for a higher price while not pushing Bob away. This offer keeps us slightly above our safety net while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
