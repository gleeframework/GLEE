Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible, making Bob more likely to engage in a conversation.  

If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'll likely counter with a price closer to $100, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
