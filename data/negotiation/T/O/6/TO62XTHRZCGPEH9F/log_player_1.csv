Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to aim higher with Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($19,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating its worth to you, the message implies the product's high value by mentioning offering it to Bob before a public listing.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't need to sell the product immediately and are willing to risk Bob rejecting the offer for a chance at a higher profit."
