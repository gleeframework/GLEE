"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll get.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to get at least $125 for this.  That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
