"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives Bob the chance to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but he's not making an outrageous offer. This shows Alice he's serious but also leaves room for compromise.
* **Reasoning provided:**  Bob explains his reasoning for the counteroffer, which makes it less likely Alice will be offended or reject it outright. 
* **Focus on value:**  By saying ""definitely interested"" Bob emphasizes that he sees value in the product, which could help convince Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $13,000 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can still potentially get a better price. 
* **Meeting in the middle isn't always fair:**  Alice is suggesting a compromise, but it's still closer to her starting point than Bob's.  By rejecting, Bob can try to push her closer to his desired price.
* **Strategic play:** By rejecting, Bob can gauge how flexible Alice is and whether she's genuinely interested in making a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful concession:** Bob shows he's willing to compromise by moving up from $12,000 to $12,500, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on fairness:** Bob frames the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Alice's sense of equity.
* **Urgency for a deal:**  By saying ""gets us closer to a deal,"" Bob subtly suggests that he's serious about buying the product and wants to make progress."
