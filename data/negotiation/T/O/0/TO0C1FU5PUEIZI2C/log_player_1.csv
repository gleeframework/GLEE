Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1450000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to benefit from the purchase.  This initial offer is a strategic move to gauge Bob's interest and potentially initiate a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,450,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still well above my minimum acceptable price.  By demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, I hope to encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  This is a crucial moment where I need to carefully assess my chances of getting a better price from Bob versus the risk of losing him and having to settle for John's offer."

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,350,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount.  Given Bob's willingness to negotiate, I believe there's still room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough to satisfy me.  I've been pushing for a higher price, but it seems like I've reached the limit of what Bob is willing to pay. Rather than risking further rounds of negotiation and possibly losing Bob as a buyer altogether, I'll take John's offer of $1,200,000.  This will ensure a sale and guarantee me a decent profit."
