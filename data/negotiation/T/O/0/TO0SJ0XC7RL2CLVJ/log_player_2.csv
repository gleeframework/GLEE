"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's perceived value ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still being a good deal for me.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  The message aims to be polite and convey that I'm genuinely interested but need a more appealing price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, it's likely we can still meet somewhere in the middle.  
* **Alternative Exists:**  We have the option to buy from John for $15,000, so there's no pressure to accept an offer above our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand where you're coming from. How about we settle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price exactly in the middle of our previous offer ($12,500) and Alice's current offer ($13,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Reaching a Fair Deal:**  $13,000 is a good price for both parties. It allows Alice to make a decent profit, and it saves me $2,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Potential Final Offer:** This counteroffer suggests that I'm getting close to my limit and might be ready to accept if Alice agrees."
