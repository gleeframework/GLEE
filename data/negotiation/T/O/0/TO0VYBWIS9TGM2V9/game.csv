"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too steep for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $95. How about we split the difference?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll do $105. That's the lowest I can go, but I think you'll really like the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $95.  If that doesn't work for you, I'm happy to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
