It's not worth buying from Alice at her current price.  Rejecting her offer allows us to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm offering Alice the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is $1,000,000. This leaves no room for further negotiation and puts the ball in her court. If she rejects, we'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still too high. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still believe we can find a price that works for both of us. If she rejects, we can still buy from John, but this gives us a better chance of getting a good deal."

Alice is getting closer to our desired price, but it's still above our limit. We should continue negotiating and see if we can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm raising my counteroffer again to $1,150,000. This demonstrates we are willing to meet her halfway but still feel the price is too high. It gives Alice a chance to close the deal without losing much more. If she rejects, we'll happily purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but we're still not at our desired price. We should continue negotiating to see if we can get a better deal. We can always buy from John if we don't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

We're getting close to our desired price.  This offer is a compromise, demonstrating our willingness to meet halfway while still holding firm on our budget. If Alice rejects, we'll buy from John, but hopefully, this will be enough to seal the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

```

We've reached a stalemate. Alice is unwilling to come down further, and we're unwilling to go higher.  It's time to move on and secure the product from John for our maximum price."
