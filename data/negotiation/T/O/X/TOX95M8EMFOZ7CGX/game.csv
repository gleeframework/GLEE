"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $100,  given that's the maximum I'm willing to spend.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for 100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too steep.  Let's try $120.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 120 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done. How about we meet at 130? It's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",130.0,Alice,5,
