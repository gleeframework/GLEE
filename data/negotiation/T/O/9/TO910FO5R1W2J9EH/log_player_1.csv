Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from his side to justify accepting."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $1,550,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This offer reflects the value the product holds for me, and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is inching closer to my acceptable range, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter one more time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price above $1,400,000.  If he's not willing to move significantly, I'll take John's offer."
