Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

**Reasoning:**  

While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, it's clear she's unlikely to reach your ideal of $1,000,000.  You have a guaranteed option with John at that price. It makes more sense to secure the product at your target price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
