Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation.  I'm offering the product at $110, which is slightly higher than its worth to Bob, but still less than the $100 I'd get from John.  This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which gives me the opportunity to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is more than Bob values the product, it's still less than what I could get from John. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a bit low for you, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $92.50 is still slightly less than what I could get from John, it's a reasonable compromise. Further negotiation might take longer and could potentially result in a lower price.  It's best to accept Bob's offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
