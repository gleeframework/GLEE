"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's important to show Bob that I value the product highly and won't sell it for a pittance.  It's also worth noting that John is a safety net for me at $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject it.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. It's also a price that I believe Bob is likely to consider, as it's closer to his initial offer than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,650,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, this is a good deal considering the limited rounds remaining. It's a significant profit for me, and I'm confident that I can find other buyers in the future."
