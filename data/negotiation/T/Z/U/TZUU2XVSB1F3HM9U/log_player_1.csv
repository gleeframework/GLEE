Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and encouraging, hoping to motivate Bob to consider the offer.
* **Plan B:**  While I'm confident in the deal with Bob, I'm always aware of the backup option of selling to John for $10,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I could accept and secure a quick sale, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. He clearly wants the product and has shown some willingness to pay. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my position and force him to come up with a counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired outcome but still leaves some room for compromise.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer, highlighting the value of the product to emphasize the fairness of the price.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** My message focuses on the benefit to both of us, suggesting that the price is a win-win scenario.

This approach aims to continue the negotiation in a positive and constructive manner, increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree it's a good product, $9,500 is still a bit much for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, especially if Bob remains firm on his budget. There's a chance that I might not be able to get a higher price, and the risk of losing the deal to John becomes more significant.
* **Secure the Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is still very profitable for me. 

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option at this point."
