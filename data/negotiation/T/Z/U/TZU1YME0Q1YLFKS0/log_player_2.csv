"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is way over his budget and he can get the same product from John for $1,200,000.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is too high for me.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Could you do $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise to aim for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my current budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,500,000.  To make this work for me, I need to be at that number as well. If you can meet that, we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and he has already stated his maximum willingness to pay.  With John offering the product for $1,200,000, it's the best option for Bob to stay within his budget and secure the product."
