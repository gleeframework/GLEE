"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Could you do $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise to aim for.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my current budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,500,000.  To make this work for me, I need to be at that number as well. If you can meet that, we have a deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
