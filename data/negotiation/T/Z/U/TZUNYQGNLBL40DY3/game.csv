"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This price reflects the true value of this product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
