Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it's worth the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message is not demanding. Phrases like ""I'm proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" suggest you're open to discussing the price.

While you have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
