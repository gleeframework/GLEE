"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,300,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,275,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll get great value out of this product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
