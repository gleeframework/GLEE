Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.

You have three options:

I'm open to further discussion, but I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,300,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,275,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,225,000? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. We're nearing the end of the rounds, so I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000 to close this deal. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. How about $1,225,000? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and it seems unlikely Bob will increase his offer.  While $1,225,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant loss compared to what the product is worth to me.  It's better to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 than to risk losing a sale entirely."
