"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're really trying to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it would be a good solution.  Let me know what you think.",10875.0,Alice,5,
