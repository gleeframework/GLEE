Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product and believe it would be a good fit for my business. Would you consider a price of $850,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to your target, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You can still try to get the price down to a level that you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping to secure a price that fits my budget. Would you consider a price of $900,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us to both achieve our desired outcomes."", ""product_price"": 900000}
