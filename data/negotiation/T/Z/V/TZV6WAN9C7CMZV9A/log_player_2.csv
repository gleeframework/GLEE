"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the optimal strategy in this scenario.  There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
