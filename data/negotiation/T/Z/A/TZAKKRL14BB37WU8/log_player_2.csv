"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good starting price, it's still above your ideal price point of $150. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible. However, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, but $110 is still a bit higher than your budget.  You can likely get a better deal if you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend right now.  How about we settle at $105?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is getting closer to your budget, it's still not the ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to get it lower. You've only had 5 rounds, so there's still time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $110, which I think is a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, which is the highest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  $112.50 is within Bob's budget of $150 and represents a good compromise from Alice's previous offer. Continuing to negotiate further could risk losing the deal entirely, especially as Alice has stated this is her final price."
