Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to me (worth at least $10,000) to justify the price.
* **Open-ended question:** The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in negotiation. 

This approach balances the goal of maximizing profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Furthermore, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $10,000. Therefore, it's not worth accepting Bob's offer at this point. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  Starting by acknowledging Bob's offer shows respect and keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $9,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  This is still closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $9,000 is a fair price.
* **Call for compromise:**  The message encourages Bob to continue the negotiation by suggesting a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is still too low for me. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's not enough to justify risking further negotiation. 

I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.  Therefore, it makes more sense to sell to John and secure the higher price."
