You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, so how about $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $9,500, but I'll throw in a small discount for you, so it'll be $9,375? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the offer of $9,375 gets you the product well below your $12,000 maximum and saves you a decent amount compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away and forcing you to buy from John at full price."
