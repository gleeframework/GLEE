"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, so how about $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $9,250 is the highest I can go.  If that works, we have a deal.",9250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $9,500, but I'll throw in a small discount for you, so it'll be $9,375?",9375.0,Alice,7,
