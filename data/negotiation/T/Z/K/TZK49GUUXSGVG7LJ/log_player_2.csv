It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially when you have a clear fallback option.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range. We'll see how Alice responds."

Alice is coming down a bit, but I'm still not ready to accept.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my target."
