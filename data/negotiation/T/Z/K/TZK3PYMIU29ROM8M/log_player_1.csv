"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I believe it's worth every penny.  I'm happy to start with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  Selling to John right now would guarantee my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we meet at $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get Bob to budge further.  Selling to John now would guarantee my minimum, but I'm hoping to secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. How about $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is tempting, I've reached the point where the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward. With John offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's time to cut my losses and secure the best possible outcome. 

My minimum threshold is $1,000,000, and I've reached that point with John.  There's no guarantee that I can push Bob higher in the next round, and the clock is ticking. It's time to move on."
