Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm more comfortable in the range of $800,000.  Would that be something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
