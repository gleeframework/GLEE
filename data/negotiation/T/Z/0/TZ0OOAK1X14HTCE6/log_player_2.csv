"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking for $12000 for the product.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're holding firm on your price, but $11,750 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $11,250 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11250. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product for $12200.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,200 is too high for Bob. He's already negotiated several rounds and it seems Alice is unwilling to budge significantly from her price. With only three rounds left, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $15,000. This guarantees him the product while still staying within his budget, and prevents further negotiation that may not yield a desirable result."
