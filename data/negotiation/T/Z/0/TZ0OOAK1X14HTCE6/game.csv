"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $10500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $11500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000 for the product.  This price is a fair reflection of the value, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
