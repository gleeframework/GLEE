Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,495,000. I know this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, offering you [mention specific benefits related to Bob's needs/interests]. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1495000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potential profit beyond John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,495,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still offers a small discount from John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. 
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, increasing its perceived worth and justifying the high price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while keeping the guaranteed offer from John as a safety net."
