You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $900,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, there's potential to save money by counteroffering.  Alice's minimum price is likely closer to her value of $800,000.  
* Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value.
* It allows room for negotiation without completely alienating Alice.
* It gives you a chance to save a significant amount of money compared to Alice's offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial counteroffer.  This suggests she's willing to negotiate further.
* While still within your budget, it's not the best deal you can potentially get. 
* Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you another opportunity to try and lower the price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above your ideal price, but demonstrates she's willing to negotiate. 
* A counteroffer of $875,000  is a compromise between your previous offer and her latest offer. It shows you're serious about buying but also that you're not willing to pay her full asking price. 
* This counteroffer might be more appealing to Alice than your last one, increasing the likelihood of her accepting."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to your maximum price of $1,000,000. 
* This indicates the negotiation is not likely to result in a significantly lower price. 
* It's better to stop the negotiation and buy from John at $1,000,000 to avoid further time and potential risk of a worse outcome."
