Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,250,000. This price reflects the significant value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable price, it's still not advantageous to continue negotiations.  We know we can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, and every counteroffer risks Alice increasing her price again. Cutting our losses and going with John guarantees the best price."
