Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me leverage to aim higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price between $8,000 and $10,000. 
* **Backup option:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $8,000, ensuring I don't lose out. 

**Important Note:** While I'm aiming high, it's important to be polite and professional in my communication with Bob to maintain a positive negotiation environment."
