"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is asking $120. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $80 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
