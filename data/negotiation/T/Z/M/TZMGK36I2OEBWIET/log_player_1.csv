"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within a specific budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While getting closer, $1,800,000 is still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to push a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution.  Let's try $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,850,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go higher, and while not ideal, $1,850,000 is a substantial profit. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing him entirely."
