"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some room to negotiate down if necessary while also demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, especially considering I have 8 rounds left. Selling to John at this point would be less profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility while still holding firm on my desire for a price closer to my minimum.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also keeping the pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's value for the product, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price. Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to be flexible and adjust my price down, but not so far that I'm losing too much.  I believe there's still room for Bob to move up, and I'm hoping this offer will encourage him to come closer to my target.  It's still a higher price than Bob's last offer, signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price. Selling to John at this point would mean losing out on potentially making more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I have three rounds left, and I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway. I'm also considering the risk of losing the deal to John, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still being below my minimum acceptable price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob is too high.  While selling to John means I won't get my ideal price, it ensures that I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale and receive a price that's significantly better than Bob's last offer.  It's a calculated risk to secure a sale and avoid the potential for a no-deal scenario."
