{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Considering its value to me, I'm offering $800,000. I'm hoping we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This price reflects the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 falls short of what I consider fair for this product. I'm willing to make another adjustment, how about $1,550,000?  This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your constraints, but I need to be mindful of the product's value. Let's make this our final exchange -  $1,425,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice's offer of $1,425,000 is lower than her previous offers, it's still over Bob's maximum price of $800,000.  He has a guaranteed way to get the product for less by buying from John. It's not worth risking further negotiations with Alice when he already has a deal in place."
