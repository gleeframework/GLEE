Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I've already compromised a lot, and $100 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, so I'll offer it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push Alice further, there's a risk she won't go below $105. Accepting this offer gets me the product for a decent price, even if it's slightly above my ideal budget."
