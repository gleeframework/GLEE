Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This is a starting point that is a bit below my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a sense that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value proposition for Bob. This encourages a positive response. 

**Strategy:**

This approach is designed to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  By starting slightly below my minimum, I create room for negotiation while still aiming for a high price.
* **Encourage Bob's participation:**  A friendly approach can make him more likely to counter-offer and continue the negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I still have the option to go with John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give up on potentially getting a much better price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I:

* **Maintain leverage:** I signal that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Open the door for further negotiation:** I can now make a counter-offer, hopefully bringing the price closer to my desired range. 
* **Keep John as a safety net:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to keep this product moving. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:**  This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value he'll get at this price. I'm also framing it as a way to get the product moving, implying that I'm flexible but not desperate.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's price.
* **Increase the odds of a deal:**  By offering a compromise, I'm more likely to find a meeting point with Bob.
* **Stay within my desired range:** $10,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to my original target of $12,000,  it's a good deal for me considering that:

* **It's above my minimum:**  $10,000 is still significantly higher than the $8,000 value Bob places on the product.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations might lead to a higher price, but it also risks dragging the process out and potentially leading to a stalemate.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer:

* **Maximizes immediate profit:**  It secures a quick sale at a reasonable price.
* **Minimizes risk:**  It avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation or losing the deal altogether.
* **Preserves resources:**  It saves me time and effort that could be spent on other opportunities."
