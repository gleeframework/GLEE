"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $120, which is within your budget. However, you can get the same product from John for $150. It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This way, you are still getting the product but saving $30."
