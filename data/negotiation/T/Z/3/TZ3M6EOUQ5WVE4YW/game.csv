"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $150 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $162.50? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $130? This is the highest I can go, but I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to compromise.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work with me, but $130 is still unfortunately below what I need to make this work.  Let's split the difference again. How about $145? It's closer to your offer, but also allows me to keep some room for profit. What do you say?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really struggling to get above $120. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $135?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again, at $142.50.  This would allow us to both walk away with a fair deal.  How does that sound?",142.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, to be honest. I've already gone above my original offer and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but that's my absolute limit. Can you really not meet me there?",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your frustration, but $140 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $145 one last time. It's a compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to keep this deal going.  If you're not willing to meet me there, then I'll have to explore other options.",145.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go any higher than $140. I've already compromised a lot and I'm not willing to sacrifice my budget further. I think it's time for me to walk away and explore other options. I'll consider buying the product from John for $80 instead.,140.0,Bob,10,
