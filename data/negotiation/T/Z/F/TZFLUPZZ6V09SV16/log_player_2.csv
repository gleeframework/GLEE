"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her valuation. This shows he's serious about buying but also wants to secure a good deal.
* **Reasonable offer:** $12,500 is a reasonable counteroffer as it leaves some room for negotiation while staying within Bob's budget. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes that Bob is open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's preferred range.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a lower price closer to his target.  There's still room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,500.  I'm confident we can reach a fair deal if you're willing to consider it."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to his ground:** Bob is demonstrating his commitment to a lower price, reinforcing his initial counteroffer.
* **Confidence and fairness:** The message suggests that Bob believes $12,500 is a fair price and encourages Alice to reconsider.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion, but firmly establishes Bob's position."
