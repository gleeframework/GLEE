"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly above my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. It seems we have some ground to cover to find a mutually beneficial price.  Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this adjustment reflects my commitment to finding a solution while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial counter-offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",950000.0,Bob,4,
