"Alice, your product is interesting, but $20000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12000 to make this deal work. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it still represents a fair value for the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. My final offer is $9000. If this works for you, we can finalize the purchase. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
