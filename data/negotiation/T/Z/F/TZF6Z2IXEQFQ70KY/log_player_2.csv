"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be extremely valuable to your business. I can't disclose the details publicly, but I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a one-time offer, so I urge you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than your maximum price.  While Alice claims the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, there's no way to verify that. It's better to reject the offer and purchase from John for a lower price."
