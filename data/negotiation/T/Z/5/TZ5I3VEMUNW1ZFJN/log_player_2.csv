"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far above his budget. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Starting at $600,000 is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. This price is still within Bob's budget, and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, there's still room for negotiation. There are still rounds left, and he can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but moving closer to Alice's price.  $750,000 is a compromise, showing Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway.  This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to make a deal, while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Alice has come down to his maximum budget, and there's no guarantee he'll get a better deal. It's important to note that even though John would sell the product for the same price, there's no guarantee that John will be willing to sell in the future rounds, or that Alice won't change her mind and come back with a lower price."
