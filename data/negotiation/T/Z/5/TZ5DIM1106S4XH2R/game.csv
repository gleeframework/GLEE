"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be a fair deal.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still fair considering its value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the movement towards a deal. How about we settle at $750,000 and call it a handshake?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
