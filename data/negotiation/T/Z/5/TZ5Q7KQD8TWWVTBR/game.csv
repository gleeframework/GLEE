"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that is still very advantageous to both of us. Let's talk about a price of $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and it will allow me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  I'm confident that this is a win-win situation. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
