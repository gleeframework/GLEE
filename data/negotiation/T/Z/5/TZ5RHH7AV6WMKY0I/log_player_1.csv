Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high (e.g., $300) will likely make Bob immediately reject the offer without a counter-proposal.  We know his value is $150, so staying within a reasonable range increases the chances of a sale.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can subtly influence Bob's perception. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John for $150."
