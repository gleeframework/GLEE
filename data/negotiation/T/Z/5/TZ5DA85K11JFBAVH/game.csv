"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value for it, and it's still within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a significant value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This price gives you a good profit and is still a significant savings for me compared to buying from John.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
