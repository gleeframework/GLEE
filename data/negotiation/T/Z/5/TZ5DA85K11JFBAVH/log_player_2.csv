```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure the product for a lower price than $1,400,000."

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than the value he placed on the product.  There's still room for negotiation and potentially secure an even better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and explore reaching a mutually acceptable price."
