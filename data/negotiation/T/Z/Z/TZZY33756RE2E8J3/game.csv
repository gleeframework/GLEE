"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $900,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a little too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
