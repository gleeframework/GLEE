"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about $9,500?  It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal, considering its value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a good price for your product, but $9,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,250. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident it will provide you with a solid profit. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,
