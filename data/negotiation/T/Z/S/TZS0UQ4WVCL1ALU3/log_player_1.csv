{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $110, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob at $110. This is above his perceived value of $80 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This strategy allows me to potentially earn a higher price than John's offer while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think the product is interesting, but I was hoping we could come to a better price. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to take his offer, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you consider $100? It's a fair price for the value you'll be getting. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm countering with $100.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 and keeps the negotiation open. I'm also emphasizing the value Bob will receive, hoping to make him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're still hoping for a bit more, but I'm getting close to my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's closer to my desired price than his previous offers, I'm not willing to risk getting stuck at a lower price.  John's offer is guaranteed to give me my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to take it and sell to him."
