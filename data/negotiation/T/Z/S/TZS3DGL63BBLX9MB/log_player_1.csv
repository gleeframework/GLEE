Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $130 for your product. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price of $140.  I'll see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get closer to $140.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $135? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I still believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $130 for your product. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than my desired price, but I'm running out of rounds.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price and then having to sell to John for $120.  It's better to accept Bob's offer now."
