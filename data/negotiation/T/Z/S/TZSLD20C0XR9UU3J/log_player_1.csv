"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $80 is too low for me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $87.50.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $82.50. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. 

Bob has made several counteroffers that are still below my minimum price. I've tried to negotiate, but it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk losing more time and ultimately getting a lower price from Bob."
