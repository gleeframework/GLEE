"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to give you a discount for being one of my first potential buyers. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",15000.0,Alice,3,
