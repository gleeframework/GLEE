Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

This strategy allows for some room for negotiation, but also leaves me with a backup option of selling to John if Bob doesn't accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to sell quickly, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful negotiation."
