"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is less than Alice's asking price of $15,000, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, which is $12,000.  This counteroffer starts with a price that's closer to Bob's ideal price point, while leaving room for potential negotiation. It's also more than John's offer, making it worth Alice's while to potentially negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's ideal price of $12,000. However, it's closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This makes it a reasonable deal for Bob. By accepting, Bob can secure the product at a price that's still advantageous, while also avoiding the potential for further negotiation."
