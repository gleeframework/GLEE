"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I still think the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750?  That's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit higher than your original target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
