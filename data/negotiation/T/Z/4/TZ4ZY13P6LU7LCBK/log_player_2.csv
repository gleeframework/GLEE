Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I still think the product is worth a premium price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is still a bit higher than your original target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems firm on her price. Accepting the $11,200 offer gets me the product for a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price."
