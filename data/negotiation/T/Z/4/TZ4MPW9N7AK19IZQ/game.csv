"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm happy to make some profit.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant price for you, and it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $950,000 still doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal. Let's try to come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've been considering your offers carefully, and I need to be realistic about my budget.  I can offer you $975,000. This is my final offer, as going any higher would make buying from John the more sensible option for me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
