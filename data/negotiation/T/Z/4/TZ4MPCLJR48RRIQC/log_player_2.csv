"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is an unbeatable deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, I'm looking to get the best possible value, and $900,000 is a bit higher than my target. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and still isn't quite at his target price. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $850,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a lower price can be achieved."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price represents a significant value for me, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer you the product for $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $875,000 is still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much as he can, and there are still rounds left to negotiate.  There's a good chance that Alice will need to come down further to close the deal, as she's already lowered her price twice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900000. I'm willing to make another slight concession and offer you the product for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has gone back up to her initial offer of $900,000. This indicates that she is unwilling to budge further. Given that Bob is running out of rounds and he's still not at his target price, it's better for him to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. While this is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still a guaranteed deal, and it prevents him from potentially losing the product to another buyer if he continues to negotiate with Alice."
