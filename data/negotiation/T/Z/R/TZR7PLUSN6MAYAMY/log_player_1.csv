This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, but it also sets a high price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested in making a counteroffer, giving me an opportunity to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and I'm willing to go up to $1,625,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price. It's only $25,000 below my initial offer and $125,000 more than what I would get from John.  This is a good deal and worth accepting."
