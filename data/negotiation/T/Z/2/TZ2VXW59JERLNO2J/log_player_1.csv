Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. While I have a guaranteed $150 from John, getting Bob to pay more is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $150. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offer is above what Bob values the product at ($100), but it's close enough that he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable."
