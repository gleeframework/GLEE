"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $12,000 to you, and to give you a good deal, I'm willing to sell it for $11,500. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob.** It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and still within Bob's budget of $12,000. 
* **Counter-offering again might lead to a further decrease in price, but there's a risk.** Alice might reject the counteroffer, leading to further negotiation and potentially wasted time.
* **Accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a good price without unnecessary delays.**

This decision balances the desire to save money with the need to avoid potentially unproductive negotiations."
