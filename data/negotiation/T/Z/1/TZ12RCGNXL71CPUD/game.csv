,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. It's a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away happy.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, but $8,750 is still a little too low. How about we meet at $8,900? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to close this deal. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,
