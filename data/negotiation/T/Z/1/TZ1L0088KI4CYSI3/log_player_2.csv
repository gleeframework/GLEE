"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is her maximum value. There's plenty of room for negotiation, so it makes sense to counter-offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer starts significantly lower than Alice's asking price but is still well below my maximum budget. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit out of your budget, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you the product for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my limit, hoping she'll be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice.  To be honest, my absolute top price is $7,000 for this product.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is still below my maximum budget but gets us closer to a potential deal.  It also introduces a sense of urgency by suggesting this is my final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you the product for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

```

Alice has come down to my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and risking her going higher, or buying from John for the same price. This is a good deal!"
