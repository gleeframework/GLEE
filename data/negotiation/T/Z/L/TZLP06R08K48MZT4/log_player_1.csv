""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable to your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point given the product's potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's still room to go up before reaching my walk-away point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and what it can bring to your business. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $950,000 is still cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to gamble that Bob will go a bit higher before I walk away to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is the highest I'm comfortable with. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $975,000 offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
