"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $12000 to me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it, but I need to feel like it's a fair price. Can you meet me in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we compromise at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not sure if the product is worth $11500 to me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, but I need to feel like it's a fair price. Can you meet me at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $12000. I'll give you a slight discount, but I need to make at least $11250 to make this deal worthwhile. Can you meet me there?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $11250 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $10750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll give you a small concession, but I need to make at least $11500. I'll meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about $10000 is too low, and $11500 is too high, so I'll meet you at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not sure if the product is worth $11000 to me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, Bob. I've made a lot of concessions, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at a price that's closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $10000?",10000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $10000 to me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",9000.0,Bob,10,
