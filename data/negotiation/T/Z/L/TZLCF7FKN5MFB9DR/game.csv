"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and it ensures I receive a fair compensation for my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high.  Given the value to me, $1,050,000 is the maximum I can offer at this time.  It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product to you for $1,075,000.  This price reflects a fair balance between our respective needs and should allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000 for the product, which is a fair price given the value it holds for both of us. I believe this offer allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $1,025,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a good deal for both parties. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
