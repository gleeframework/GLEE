"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you recognizing its value to me.  While I'm definitely interested, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $9,750. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
