"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer $1,450,000. This is a very fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
