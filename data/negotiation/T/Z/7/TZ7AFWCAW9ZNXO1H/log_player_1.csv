Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $1,500 difference provides space for negotiation and allows for a potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and inviting message creates a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  I have successfully sold the product at a good price.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's better to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($15,000), it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially finding a compromise. 
* **Opportunity Cost of Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed. However, I'm not willing to give up the chance to potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $13,500, trying to find a middle ground while still securing a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $12,500 and my previous offer of $13,500.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  $13,000 is still a profitable price for me, considering my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Positive and Persuasive Tone:**  My message remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider my offer.  It emphasizes a ""fair deal"" for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I have secured a good price for the product.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to evaluate Bob's potential counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue the negotiation or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from $13,000. I'd like to make another offer of $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $12,250 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's clear that we're at an impasse, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of continued negotiation with Bob, which might lead to a lower price or a prolonged process.
* **Time Value:**  My time is valuable, and continuing this negotiation with Bob would consume time and energy without a clear path to a favorable outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept John's offer and move on to other opportunities.  While I would have preferred a higher price, securing a guaranteed profit is the most logical and efficient decision at this point."
