"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you valuing your product so highly. However, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
