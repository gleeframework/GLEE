{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price of $150. Since I know the product is worth $120 to Bob, he might counteroffer, but I'm hoping he'll see the value and accept.  If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide if I want to keep negotiating or go with John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
