"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob, but there's room to negotiate and save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also acknowledging your desire to save some money. What do you think?

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $825,000 is a good price considering the value of the product to Bob.  Accepting this offer saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
