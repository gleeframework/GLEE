"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, but still leaves room for some negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, which could encourage him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I could sell to John for $800,000, I want to maximize my profit. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would still provide you with a significant value for the product."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $750,000?  I believe that would be a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price in the next round.  I'm still hopeful that with continued negotiation, we can find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle at $800,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable product while ensuring I receive a fair price. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
