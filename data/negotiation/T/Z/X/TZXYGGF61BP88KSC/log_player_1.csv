Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my needs and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.

Round 4

This would allow you to make a small profit while still allowing me to purchase the product within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 6
