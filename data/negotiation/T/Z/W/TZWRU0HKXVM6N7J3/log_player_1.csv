Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation, but still allows you to make a profit while considering Bob's potential value.  If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer or move on to John for a guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum price point of $120.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested.  $95 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This would still give you a good deal, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $100. This is a fair price that's in our best interest. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $100 is still below your ideal price point, it's getting closer to your minimum of $120.  There's a risk of further negotiation, and it's possible Bob will walk away, leaving you with John's offer of $120. However,  the chance of a further decrease in price from Bob is uncertain, and $100 is a good compromise."
