Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to $100 as possible, but I'm willing to accept a lower price if Bob's counteroffer is reasonable and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to sell to Bob for $80 than to risk a counteroffer and potentially end up with nothing."
