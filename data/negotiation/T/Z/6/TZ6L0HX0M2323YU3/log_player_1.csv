"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leave room for counteroffers:**  I'm not going for a super aggressive opening price that could immediately make Bob walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **More negotiation room:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's a chance that I can convince Bob to pay closer to my asking price in the next round. 
* **John as backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer ensures I can still secure a good price for the product if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Maintain profit:** $110 is still a decent profit for me, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation open and prevents a breakdown. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. Would you be willing to go lower to $105 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited negotiation room:** I've already lowered my price once, and further concessions may lead to a deal that's not profitable for me.
* **John is a better option:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, making him a more attractive buyer at this point. 
* **Risk of deadlock:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate and a loss of time, potentially jeopardizing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go lower than $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to pay that, I'll have to move on to other buyers. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but polite:**  I'm being firm about my price, but maintaining a respectful tone to avoid alienating Bob completely.
* **Highlight value again:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Imply consequences:**  I hint at the possibility of selling to John to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to reconsider. 
* **Final stand:**  I'm sticking to my minimum price to ensure I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable paying $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider this revised price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer, while slightly higher than before, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited negotiation room:** We've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm not sure there's much room for further concessions that would be profitable for me.
* **John is a secure option:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I've already invested a few rounds trying to negotiate with Bob.
* **Time constraint:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and continuing with Bob risks running out of time without a sale.

By selling to John, I ensure I get my minimum price and avoid potentially losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
