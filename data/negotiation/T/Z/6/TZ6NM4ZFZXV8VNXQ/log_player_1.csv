Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my ideal price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of a lower offer from John or a drawn-out negotiation."
