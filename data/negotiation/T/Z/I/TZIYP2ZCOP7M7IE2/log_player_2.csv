Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation isn't progressing as quickly as Bob hoped.  Alice has increased her price again, and there's a risk of her continuing to do so. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and at this point, buying from John for $15,000 ensures he gets the product while still staying within his budget.  While it's not the ideal price, it's a safer option than risking further rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
