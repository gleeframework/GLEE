"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $130 is a good price, you can potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $125. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $125 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum price of $150 and allows him to save $25 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
