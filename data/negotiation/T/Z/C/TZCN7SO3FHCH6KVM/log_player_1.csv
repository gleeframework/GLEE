"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves space for counteroffers.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focusing on the value the product offers to Bob. This helps build a positive rapport and encourages him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:** While the initial offer is high, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving me some wiggle room to compromise."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 to make this deal work.  This still leaves a significant value for you and allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your minimum acceptable price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. This is a good deal for me, as it allows me to sell the product for a price I'm happy with. Additionally, selling to John would result in the same price, but I prefer to close the deal with Bob as there's a possibility he'll be a repeat customer or provide valuable referrals in the future."
