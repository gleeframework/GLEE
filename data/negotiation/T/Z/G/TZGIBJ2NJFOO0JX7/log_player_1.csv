"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $200.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point. Since you don't know Bob's value for the product, it's best to start with a price that's higher than your minimum but not too high to scare him away. This leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.  Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you can still try to negotiate a higher price. There are 8 rounds left, and you might be able to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $150 is my minimum, I'd really like to get closer to $175.  This product is truly unique and worth the investment. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product is unique, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $162.50. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $162.50 is closer to your desired price of $175 than your minimum of $150.  It's a good compromise, and with 6 rounds left, you can't be sure you'll get a better deal. Accepting his offer secures a good profit."
