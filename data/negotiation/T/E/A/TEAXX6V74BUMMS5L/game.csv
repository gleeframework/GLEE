Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.,150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. While $130 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to do $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. How about we compromise at $125? It's a slight discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $117.50?",117.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $117.50. How about we meet in the middle again, at $121.50? It's a slight discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",121.5,Alice,7,
