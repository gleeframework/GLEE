"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit high for my budget, I was hoping to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This is a fair price considering the quality and what you'll gain from it.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a great product, but $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you consider $11,500? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $11,500 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we make it $15,500 and we have a deal?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me.  How about $12,000 even? That's the absolute top of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,
