Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit high for my budget, I was hoping to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This is a fair price considering the quality and what you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a great product, but $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you consider $11,500? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $11,500 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we make it $15,500 and we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me.  How about $12,000 even? That's the absolute top of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob has consistently shown he's unwilling to go above his $12,000 valuation.  While we're getting closer to my minimum, it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap significantly. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
