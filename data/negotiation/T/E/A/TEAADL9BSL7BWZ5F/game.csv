"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
