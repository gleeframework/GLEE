"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant drop from her initial offer and still saves Bob $225,000 compared to buying from John."
