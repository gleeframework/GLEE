"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm eager to get this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm counteroffering at $9,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9800.0,Alice,5,
