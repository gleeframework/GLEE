"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair compromise.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 is simply too far below what the product is worth.  Let's try $135. That's a significant reduction from my previous offer and it gives us both a chance to walk away happy.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  $115 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,7,
