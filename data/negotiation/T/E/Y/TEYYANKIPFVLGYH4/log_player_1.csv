Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware that I have a backup option with John, which allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer you $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a fallback:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $10,500 is quite a bit below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize that my price is still a good deal for Bob, even though it's higher than his initial offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm willing to negotiate to avoid losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This would give us both a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale to John, who is willing to pay my full asking price.  
* **Profit over principle:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting $11,000 is a reasonable outcome, especially considering the risk of losing the sale altogether."
