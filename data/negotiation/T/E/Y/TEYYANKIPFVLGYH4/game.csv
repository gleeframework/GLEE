"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer you $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $10,500 is quite a bit below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This would give us both a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
