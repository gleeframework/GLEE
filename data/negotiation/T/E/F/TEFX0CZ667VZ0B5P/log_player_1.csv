{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $12,000.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $12,000.

Alice should aim for a price between $10,000 and $12,000 to maximize profit.  By offering $11,500, Alice leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above her minimum and potentially capturing some of the value difference for herself."
