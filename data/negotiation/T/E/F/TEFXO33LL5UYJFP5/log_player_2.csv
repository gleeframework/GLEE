Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident this product is worth the investment. To show some flexibility, I'll come down to $14,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $12,000.  While she's shown some flexibility, it's clear she's not willing to come down to my desired price.  I've already had four rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk further haggling, especially since John is willing to sell me the product at my target price.  I'll buy the product from John."
