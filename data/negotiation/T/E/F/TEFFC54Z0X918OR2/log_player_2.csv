"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this high-quality product at a special price of $10,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer leads to a worse outcome:**  Rejecting Alice's offer forces Bob to buy from John at $12,000, which is more expensive. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial option for Bob."
