"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic price for a product worth much more, and it gives you a substantial profit margin. Let me know if you're interested!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
