# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a competitive price, and I get to sell it to someone who will truly appreciate it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, you can get the product for $100,000 less from John.  There's no point in spending more when you have a guaranteed better option."
