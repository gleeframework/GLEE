Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe this product will be highly valuable to you, even though it's slightly above your estimated worth. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation while ensuring Alice doesn't lose money if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob."
