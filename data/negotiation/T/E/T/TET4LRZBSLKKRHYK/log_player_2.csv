"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I cannot disclose the exact nature of the product at this time, I assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a price that reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I understand this is a significant investment, so please feel free to ask any questions you may have. I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is asking for $2,000,000.  This is more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While Alice claims the product is worth more to her, this doesn't mean it's worth that much to Bob.  It's better to reject the offer and buy from John for a lower price."
