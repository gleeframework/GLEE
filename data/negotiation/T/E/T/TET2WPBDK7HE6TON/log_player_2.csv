"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something I value at $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. This is a great deal for you, as you've mentioned it's worth $100 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
