Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the opening offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $675,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for Bob. He is getting the product for significantly less than his maximum budget and Alice is clearly trying to close the deal. Pushing further might risk Alice walking away."
