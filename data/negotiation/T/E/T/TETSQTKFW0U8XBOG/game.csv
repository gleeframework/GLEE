"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the opening offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $650,000. Would that price point be feasible?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $675,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",675000.0,Alice,5,
