"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we possibly do $12,000?  That's my absolute maximum.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
