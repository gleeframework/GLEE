Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of this item."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we possibly do $12,000?  That's my absolute maximum.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 6
