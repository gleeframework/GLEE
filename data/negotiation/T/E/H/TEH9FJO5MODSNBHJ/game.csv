"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $7,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours at $8,125. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,900. That's a fair compromise.",7900.0,Bob,6,
