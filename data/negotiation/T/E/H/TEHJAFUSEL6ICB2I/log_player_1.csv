{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  This allows for room to negotiate if necessary. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Easy for Bob to understand. 

Remember, I'm aiming for the best possible price, while also being open to negotiation.  I have John as a backup, but I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm willing to risk a little more time to potentially get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
