I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a decent margin while still potentially appealing to Bob. I'm hoping he values the product higher than $1,200,000, but I'm willing to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum threshold. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still securing a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum threshold.  I'll sell to John for $1,200,000, which is a safe and secure option."
