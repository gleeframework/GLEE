"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000 for the product. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
