Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $800,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate. However, it leaves room for Bob to counteroffer while still potentially securing a profit for me.  It also avoids going too high initially and potentially scaring Bob away."
