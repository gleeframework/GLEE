Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $120, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $80, which is $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the product's minimum value for me, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a compromise, and I hope you can see the value in the product.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is clearly not budging towards your acceptable price range. You've successfully negotiated down, but continuing might not yield a price much better than John's offer.  Getting the product for $80 from John is a better outcome than risking a higher price from Alice with no guarantee of getting it lower."
