"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than $100. Considering its worth to you is $150, I would like to propose a price of $120 for it. This offer allows you to acquire the product at a reasonable premium compared to its lesser perceived value by others. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,
