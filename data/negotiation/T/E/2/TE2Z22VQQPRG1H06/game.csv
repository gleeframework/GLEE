"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $2,000,000 may have been ambitious, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I can't justify going that high. Could we meet somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
