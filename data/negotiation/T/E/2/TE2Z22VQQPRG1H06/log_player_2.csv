"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $2,000,000 may have been ambitious, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,300,000?

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to close that gap. John offers a sure deal at your target price, making it the most logical choice."
