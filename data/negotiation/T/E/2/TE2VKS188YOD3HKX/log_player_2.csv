"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product that I believe you'll really appreciate. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. It's a one-time offer, so I'd love to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over his budget. He has a better option to get the product for $10,000 from John, so he should start negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a bit closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000, but I'm willing to make a small concession. I can meet you at $15,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $15,500, which is still over Bob's budget. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, making him the more appealing option at this point."
