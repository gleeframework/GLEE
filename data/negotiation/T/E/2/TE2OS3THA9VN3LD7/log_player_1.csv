Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer sets the price at $1,000,000. Here's why:

* **It's a good compromise:** It's lower than Bob's valuation, giving him a good deal, but still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you make a good profit.
* **It incentivizes Bob:** He can still earn $200,000 in value by accepting. This makes it more likely he'll choose to buy from you rather than risk losing the opportunity.
* **It's a safe bet:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed buyer in John for $800,000. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of selling at a higher price while still providing a safety net."
