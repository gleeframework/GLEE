{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still allows for negotiation. It's also significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for counteroffers and potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $9,500. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

My counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell at a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $9,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above that. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good compromise and I believe it's worth accepting rather than risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower offer or a deal with John that is less favorable in the long run."
