"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,000? It's still a great price for a product worth much more to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't regret.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  I'm still a little firm on the price, but I'll meet you in the middle at $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",12000.0,Alice,7,
