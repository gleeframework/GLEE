"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This price is fair and allows for some room for negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this price offers a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price is fair and allows for a smooth transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
