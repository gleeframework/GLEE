"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's something that could potentially increase your profits by a considerable amount. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the fact that I could easily sell it to another buyer for a lower price. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
