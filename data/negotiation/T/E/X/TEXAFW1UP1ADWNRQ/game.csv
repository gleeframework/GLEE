"I appreciate the offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is still a great price for a product of this caliber. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1300000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1300000 is closer, but it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and come down to $1400000. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.  Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
