Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial price is quite high for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  Let's find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which reflects a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope we can find common ground at this price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  While I'm very interested in this product, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this point.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob's offer is now close enough to my minimum that it makes sense to accept. It's better to secure a sure $1,000,000 than risk him walking away and potentially having to accept John's offer anyway."
