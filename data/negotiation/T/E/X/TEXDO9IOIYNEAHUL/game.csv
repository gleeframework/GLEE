"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial price is quite high for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  Let's find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but the product's value significantly exceeds that price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which reflects a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be honest, though, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the value this product offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  While I'm very interested in this product, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this point.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
