"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $950,000?  This gives you a good profit margin and saves me a considerable amount.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
