"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. This price reflects its market value and allows for a substantial return on your investment. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely secure a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $950,000?  This gives you a good profit margin and saves me a considerable amount.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves Alice with a profit.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
