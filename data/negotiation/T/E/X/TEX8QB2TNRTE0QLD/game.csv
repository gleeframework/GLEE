"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a fair price for you, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This gives you a good deal and allows me to still make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise and a good value for you. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. Let's meet in the middle.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,280,000 is a fair price for you, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, at $1,315,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits us both. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",1315000.0,Alice,7,
