"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a substantial opportunity for both of us.  Let's discuss further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** $1,000,000 is less than $1,200,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to you and you can acquire it for $1,000,000, saving you $200,000."
