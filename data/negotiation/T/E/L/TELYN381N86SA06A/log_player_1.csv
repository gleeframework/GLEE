Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, we can see how much he's willing to pay and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $90. I will reject his offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $100 is a decent compromise. It's higher than his previous offer and closer to my minimum.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
