Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique item"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential gain. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a secure offer from John at $1,200,000, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum acceptable price."
