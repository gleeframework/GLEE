"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This also sets the stage for a potential counter-offer from Bob, allowing us to establish a negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can secure a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a higher price from Bob with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to make another counteroffer, getting us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's tempting to accept this offer because time is ticking away.  But, I believe we're close to a deal with Bob, and I'm going to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,050,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  I believe this price is still within a reasonable range for both of us and could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I'm still hoping to secure a better price from Bob, it's looking increasingly unlikely. Bob's offers keep dropping, and my counteroffers aren't moving him. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000, and it seems Bob might not be willing to go higher.

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's a shame, but it's the most sensible option at this point."
