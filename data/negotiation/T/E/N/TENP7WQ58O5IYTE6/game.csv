"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it, as that's my maximum budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
