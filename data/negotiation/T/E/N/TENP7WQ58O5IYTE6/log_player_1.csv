Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it, as that's my maximum budget. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.
