"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and the significant savings I'm offering compared to purchasing from John.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the discount you're offering compared to the original price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $887,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",887500.0,Alice,5,
