Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and the significant savings I'm offering compared to purchasing from John.
