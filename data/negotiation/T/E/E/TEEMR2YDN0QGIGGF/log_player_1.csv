"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's value to me, hoping to subtly encourage Bob to see its worth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him. 
* **John's Option:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I will consider selling to John for $100 to ensure I get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum of $100, making it a financially unfavorable deal for me. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Option:** Selling to John for $100 would guarantee my minimum, but I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between Bob's offer and my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about $105? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for some room for us both."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counter-offering at $105, which is closer to my minimum of $100 but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Compromise Focus:** I'm emphasizing the idea of compromise and a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Value Justification:** I'm subtly reiterating the product's value to remind Bob of its worth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer and decide on my next move. 
* **John's Option:** If Bob rejects my offer again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $100 to secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still trying to stay within my budget though. How about $95? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $95 is just below my minimum of $100. However, considering we've already had three rounds of negotiation, and the time constraint (only 10 rounds total), it's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly higher offer.
* **Potential for Agreement:** Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that accepting it will ensure a profitable sale. 
* **John's Option:** While selling to John for $100 would be a guaranteed $10 profit, the time spent negotiating with Bob could potentially have been used to find a different buyer with a higher offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Closing the Deal:** I will accept Bob's offer to finalize the transaction."
