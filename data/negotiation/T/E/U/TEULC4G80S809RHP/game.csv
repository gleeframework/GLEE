,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it right now. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800. This is a very fair price, and I believe we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Bob,6,
