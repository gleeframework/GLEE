Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800. This is a very fair price, and I believe we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.

Reasoning: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for a smaller potential profit."
