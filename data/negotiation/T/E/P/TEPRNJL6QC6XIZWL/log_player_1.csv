{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. I'm thinking of $140 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $125.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 135}
