"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product is interesting, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I do have another offer for $10,000, so I'd be willing to close the deal with you at $9,500. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to go with the other offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. I believe it's still a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to finalize the deal at this point.",9200.0,Alice,5,
