Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $125? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
