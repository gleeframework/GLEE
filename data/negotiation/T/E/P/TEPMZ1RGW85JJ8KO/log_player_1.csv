"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit close to my minimum acceptable price.  Since Bob only values the product at $80, he's unlikely to accept this initial offer.  This allows me to see if he's interested at all and gauge his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $80.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the game, and John is a sure thing.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and ending up with nothing.  Accepting $140 will ensure I at least get something for my product."
