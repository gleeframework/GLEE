You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,000,000.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to profit.  It's a starting point for negotiation that shows you're serious about buying the product but are willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price point, it's still higher than Alice's value.  There's likely still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your desired range.  It also leaves a small margin for Alice to profit while still achieving a significant savings for you."
