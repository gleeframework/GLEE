"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about $110? That feels like a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $125 is very close, but I have a strict budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $120? That's the absolute most I can spend.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,7,
