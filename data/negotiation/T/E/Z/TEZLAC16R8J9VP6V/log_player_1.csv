Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. This amount aligns better with what I am able to spend while still allowing me to acquire a high-quality product. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
