{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, aiming to maximize potential profit. The message also acknowledges potential negotiation, making Bob feel like he has some control and encourages him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is above the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $7000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal.  I'm going to go ahead and sell to John for $8,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than getting $7,000 from Bob. I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and end up with a worse deal."
