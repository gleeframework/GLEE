Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. My initial price is $2,000,000. I'm open to negotiation, but this is a fair price considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. While I understand its worth to you, my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Given the product's potential and my own investment in it, I can't go lower than $1,700,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I can only consider offers within my financial limits. I am willing to increase my offer to $1500000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price and matches what John is willing to pay.  While I'd love to get more, it's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
