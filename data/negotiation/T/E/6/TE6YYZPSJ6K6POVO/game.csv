"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1500000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm very interested, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid it's still below the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings to the table.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise, considering my budget limitations.  I hope we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your offer. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
