Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $950000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I need to accept.

Let's close this deal and move forward.
