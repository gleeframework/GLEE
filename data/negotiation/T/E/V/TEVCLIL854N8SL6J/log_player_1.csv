"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. It's a bold move, but it sets a strong initial expectation.
* **Emphasize Value:**  My message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, making him think about its worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price, showing that I'm open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get as much money as possible, but also to avoid losing the deal to John. Starting high with a strong message gives me a good starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product's value,  $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, which I believe is a fair starting point considering my  maximum purchase limit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I understand Bob's budget constraints, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, but I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my earnings, and $800,000 isn't enough. I'm willing to continue negotiations with Bob, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer of $1,200,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but a significant drop from my initial offer.
* **Acknowledging Budget:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget limitations but emphasizing that $800,000 is too low.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise while still seeking a higher price.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's more reasonable than my initial price, I'm showing Bob I'm serious about a deal but not willing to settle for a low price. This approach aims to find common ground and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to my goal.
* **Avoiding John:**  While selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob if I keep negotiating.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit, and $950,000 is not enough. I'm hoping that by continuing negotiations, I can convince Bob to raise his offer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This price reflects the unique benefits this product offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's latest offer ($950,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique benefits to justify the price, emphasizing that it's not just about meeting a budget but securing a valuable asset. 
* **Closing the Deal:** The message urges Bob to close the deal, adding a sense of urgency while maintaining a respectful tone.

**Strategy:**

By meeting halfway, I'm demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution. The price is still above my minimum, but it's a concession that shows good faith. This approach aims to encourage Bob to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1075000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1000000, which demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price is fair considering our ongoing negotiation and my willingness to meet you halfway. Let's find a solution that allows us both to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No further negotiation:** There is no need to reject and continue negotiating as this is my minimum.
* **Avoid risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees the minimum price and eliminates the risk of the negotiation falling apart or losing the deal to John. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get the most money possible. While I initially aimed for a higher price, Bob's offer is acceptable and securing a deal is more important than pursuing further negotiation rounds."
