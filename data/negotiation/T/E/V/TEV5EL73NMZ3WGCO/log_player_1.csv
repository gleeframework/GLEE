{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $13,000 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000, but I'm not going much lower than that."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,500 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $14,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway at $13,500. It's still a good price for me, and hopefully, it's tempting enough for him to accept."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm running out of time and Bob seems determined to stay at a price lower than what I'd like.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer in the remaining rounds, I'll sell to John for $10,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still better than what Bob is offering."
