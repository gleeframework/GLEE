Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to limit ourselves. Starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Fallback:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so any offer accepted above that is a win. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If we knew he was very price-sensitive, a different approach might be better.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate starting price might be preferred."
