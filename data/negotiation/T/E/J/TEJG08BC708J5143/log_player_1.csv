"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a significant markup, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn a substantial profit.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate, given the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is still a good price, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $850,000.  This is a middle ground between Bob's offer and my last counteroffer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $850,000.  I'm not yet concerned about running out of rounds because I have the option of selling to John for $800,000, which is still a good outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 840000}
```

I'm going to counter with $840,000. This is a small reduction from my last offer, demonstrating my willingness to be flexible but still maintaining a strong price point.  I believe this offer is attractive enough to Bob, but I'm prepared to go a little lower in the next round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations are becoming quite difficult. Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum price, but I'm concerned that he might not be willing to go any higher. Additionally, I'm worried that if I reject his offer, he might not counteroffer again. 

Instead of risking further negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price, this is still a good outcome considering the time constraints and the possibility of further stalemate."
