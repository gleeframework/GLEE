"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** You're willing to pay $15,000, and that's exactly what she's offering. 
* **You have a better alternative.**  John is willing to sell you the same product for the same price. 
* **No benefit to accepting Alice's offer.** You gain nothing by buying from Alice instead of John.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can still acquire the product at your desired price, but you've left open the possibility of negotiating with Alice or finding another seller who might offer a lower price."
