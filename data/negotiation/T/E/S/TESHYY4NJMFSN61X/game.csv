"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $13,000. I think this is a great deal considering its value to you.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $12,500?  This would still give you a good profit and I'd be happy to make the purchase.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, Alice.  However, $13,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy the product from you then.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $13,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $13,500, and I think that's the best I can do. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer the product to you for $13,750. This is my final offer.",13750.0,Alice,5,
