"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and a good starting point for us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $900,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a valuable product. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try to find common ground here. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I propose a price of $1,000,000. This is the highest I can go while still making sense for my financial situation. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,000,000 just isn't enough for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? I'm sure we can both walk away from this deal feeling good about it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and I believe $1,000,000 is the maximum I can afford without compromising my financial stability. I'm sorry, but I can't go above that. I hope we can find a way to meet somewhere in between these figures.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
