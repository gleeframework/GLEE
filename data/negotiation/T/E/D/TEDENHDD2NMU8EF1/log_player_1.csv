Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I know it's a valuable asset for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $1150000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Would you be willing to go up to $1,250,000? That would be a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1225000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him by continuing to negotiate.  Furthermore, selling to John would only yield $1,200,000, which is less than Bob's offer.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most beneficial choice."
