"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $110. I believe it's worth significantly more, and I know how beneficial it could be for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better.  Alice's message suggests she might be willing to go lower, and you have the backup option of John at $120."
