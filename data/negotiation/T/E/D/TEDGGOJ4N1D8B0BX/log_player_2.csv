"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it would be a valuable addition for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can try to get a better price from Alice.  $140 is too high, but you don't want to risk losing the deal and having to pay John $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see you're interested, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's within your budget and a good deal for you, especially considering John is selling it for $150."
