"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while ensuring I stay within my budget. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,,
