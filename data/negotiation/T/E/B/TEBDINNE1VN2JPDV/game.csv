"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? I believe that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great price considering the value of this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a good middle ground. How about $11,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
