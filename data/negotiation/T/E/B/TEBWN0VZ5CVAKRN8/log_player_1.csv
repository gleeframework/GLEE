"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting high with $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see how Bob reacts.  If he's serious, he may counter, giving us room to negotiate. If he rejects outright, I'll need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit low. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see where we land."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,700,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for further discussion. I'm hoping this encourages him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,600,000, which is closer to what I'm looking for.  It's only $200,000 less than my initial offer, and I don't want to risk pushing him further and losing him as a buyer altogether. I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
