Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's less than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves me with a profit of $40. I'm confident that Bob will find this offer appealing, and I'm open to negotiating further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate but still remaining firm on a price that benefits me. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown he's willing to go up to $125. This is a good price, and I'm confident it's the best I can get. I'll accept Bob's offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price."
