"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking for $150 for it. Is that something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to consider $80? ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $110 for the product?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to split the difference - how about $95? It's a fair compromise that lets us both get a good deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $95. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
