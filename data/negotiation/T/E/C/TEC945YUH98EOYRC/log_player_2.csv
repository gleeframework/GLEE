"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets a clear expectation that Bob is willing to negotiate, but also demonstrates that he is serious about acquiring the product.  The $8,000 offer leaves room for negotiation while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for Alice to come down, and Bob wants to save as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go to $9,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it within his budget. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's previous offer but still leaving room for some potential compromise. This strategy aims to keep the negotiations moving forward without giving away too much ground."
