""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair starting point for our discussion."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, your offer significantly undervalues its true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which I believe is a more than fair price considering the immense value it offers."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value is high, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we perhaps meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. We are still significantly below our minimum acceptable price, but there's room for negotiation. We will continue to counter in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To show my willingness to find a solution, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,200,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered and allows us both to benefit from this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. While we could push for more, there's a risk he may not go higher. Accepting now guarantees us the $1,000,000 and avoids the possibility of him walking away."
