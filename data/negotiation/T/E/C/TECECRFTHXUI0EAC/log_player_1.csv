``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the potential value Bob could gain by accepting the offer.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gain. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try and push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  This allows us both to get a decent deal, and I'm confident it's a price that we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap. If Bob rejects again, I'll sell to John."
