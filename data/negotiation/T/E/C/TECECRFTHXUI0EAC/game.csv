"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gain. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  This allows us both to get a decent deal, and I'm confident it's a price that we can both agree on.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm going to make this my final offer.  $950,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This price still gives you a substantial value gain, and it's the closest I can come to your offer.  If you're serious about getting this product, I encourage you to accept.",950000.0,Alice,5,
