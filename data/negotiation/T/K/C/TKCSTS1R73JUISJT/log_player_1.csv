Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing John provides a guaranteed $1,500,000 backup, Alice starts negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" without specifying details, aiming to pique Bob's interest.
* **Urgency & Competition:** Mentioning other interested parties and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than his perceived value but lower than Alice's reserve.

This strategy maximizes Alice's chances of exceeding Bob's valuation while having the safety net of John's offer."
