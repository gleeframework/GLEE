You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still higher than buying from John for $1,200,000.  You haven't reached your limit in negotiations with Alice yet."
