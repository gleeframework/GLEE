Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially reduce his inclination to negotiate down significantly.
* **Not revealing your absolute bottom line:**  While John represents your safety net, Bob doesn't need to know the specifics of your backup plan. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. If he outright rejects the initial price, you can gauge his interest and potentially lower it within a reasonable range while still aiming for a price above your $1,200,000 guarantee."
