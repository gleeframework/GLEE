Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is better than nothing, I can do better.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere.  I'm willing to make one last concession and drop my price to $1,200,000.  This is my bottom line.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,180,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're willing to sell, let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer of $1,180,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not what I want.  I've already made several concessions, and I don't want to risk going lower and losing out on a sale to John.  John is a reliable buyer who will pay my minimum price of $1,200,000."
