{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000.  This means he *might* be willing to pay a bit more, but not excessively so.
* **Leveraging John:** Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 gives us a strong fallback position. We should aim higher with Bob, knowing we have this safety net.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down a bit while still staying above our minimum.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $19,000. However, this strategy maximizes our potential profit while considering the information we have."
