"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and potentially sway Bob towards accepting. 
* **Leaving Space for Counteroffers:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, signaling that I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $95 for it. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold of $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $100 is a secure option, but rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore if I can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price slightly from $110 to $105. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob about the product's value to justify the price.
* **Setting a Clear Expectation:**  My message is clear and concise, leaving no room for ambiguity about my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose $100 as the price for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 finally meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further gains:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time constraints:**  I'm aware that I have a limited number of rounds, and pushing further could lead to a stalemate. 
* **Secure outcome:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
