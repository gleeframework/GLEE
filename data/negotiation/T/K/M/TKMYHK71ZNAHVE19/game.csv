"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $125 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $105. This is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $105 is still a bit low for me. I can offer you a compromise at $115. It's a fair price that I'm willing to meet you at, and I think you'll find it's worth it",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm still not able to go higher than $110. This would be a fair price, and I'm sure you'd still make a decent profit.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $110 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you the product for $118, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you",118.0,Alice,7,
