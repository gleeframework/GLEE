"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I know it's something that could truly benefit you.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always wise to begin negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Leaving Room:** The initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you ample space to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still too early to accept. There's potential to negotiate a higher price. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe the product offers significant untapped potential that justifies a higher price.  How about we meet halfway at $1,325,000?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Apparent):**  By suggesting you ""meet halfway,"" you're creating a sense of compromise, even though this price is still significantly above Bob's offer and comfortably above your minimum.
* **Focusing on Potential:**  You're reiterating the product's potential, subtly suggesting that Bob might be undervaluing its long-term benefits. 
* **Strong but Negotiable:**  This counteroffer is a strong move but leaves you room to negotiate down if necessary in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, so how about we meet in the middle of that and your previous offer at $1,312,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has moved considerably from his initial offer of $1,200,000. This indicates a willingness to pay a premium for the product.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively for smaller increments might frustrate Bob and risk derailing the deal. 
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,312,500 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price. It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it by pushing for the absolute maximum."
