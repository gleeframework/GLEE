Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product for me. However, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.

After careful consideration, I am willing to consider your offer. However, due to the high demand for this product, I must maintain a minimum price.
