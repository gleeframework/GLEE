"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By offering $10,500, Bob establishes a starting point for further negotiation. This counteroffer leaves room for both parties to compromise.
* **Motivation:**  This offer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in buying the product while simultaneously pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11000? That's still a great price for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice's counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's offer and her previous offer.
* **Cost-Effective:**  $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than the price from John.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a better price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product at a reasonable price while minimizing risk."
