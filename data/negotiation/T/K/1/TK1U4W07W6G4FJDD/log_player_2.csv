# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a bit high. I'm still willing to pay up to $10,000, so I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm happy to pay $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my price, I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000 for this product. I've already stated my maximum price, and she's not budging.  It's clear that we're at an impasse. Rather than continue to negotiate and potentially lose time, I'll take the guaranteed deal from John for $10,000."
