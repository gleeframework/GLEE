Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** I know I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so I don't want to go below that.
* **Profit is Key:** My goal is to maximize profit.  If Bob accepts the $19,000, it's a significant gain. If he negotiates, I have room to lower the price while still aiming for more than my minimum."
