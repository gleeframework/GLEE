"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.**  Therefore, accepting it would be a bad decision.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.**  Since you know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for a deal that benefits both of you. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option, but it's not the best deal.**  Negotiating with Alice has the potential to save you money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I've started with a counteroffer of $13,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above the product's value to her.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This creates space for negotiation, leaving room for potential concessions.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and respectful tone, making the counteroffer more likely to be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident in the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within my budget.**  At $13,500, it's a good deal for me.
* **Negotiating further might not get a better price.**  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept.  
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out, and I could lose out on the product if I wait too long.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  $13,500 is a better deal than John's $15,000.

By accepting Alice's offer, I secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
