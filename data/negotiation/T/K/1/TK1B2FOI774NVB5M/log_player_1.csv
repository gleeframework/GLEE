Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset for your business. My starting price is $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1400000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. This price is fair considering the value to me and leaves some room for you to profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can achieve a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still provides you with a substantial value and allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1300000. This would be a good compromise and allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum desired price, $1,300,000 is still below what I believe is a fair value for the product. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can achieve a higher price with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business. To make this a truly mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a significant concession on my part and puts us very close to a deal.  Let's find a way to bridge this small gap."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
