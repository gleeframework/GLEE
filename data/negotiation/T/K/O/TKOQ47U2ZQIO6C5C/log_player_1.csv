"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is just too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I can do $95, that's the best I can do 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

While not ideal, getting $95 from Bob is better than settling for John's $100 offer. It's a close call, but taking a small profit is preferable to potentially losing out on a deal entirely in further rounds."
