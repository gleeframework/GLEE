Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $120, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to $150 and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $135. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, so it shows I'm willing to compromise. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out on any potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting too low with his offer.  I'm willing to walk away and get my minimum price from John."
