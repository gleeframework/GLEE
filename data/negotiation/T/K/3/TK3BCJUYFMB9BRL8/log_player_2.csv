"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're extending this opportunity at a special price of $95. We're confident it's a fair deal considering its worth to you is $80. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no point in paying $95."
