"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product to me is quite high. Could you consider $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $13,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in making a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
