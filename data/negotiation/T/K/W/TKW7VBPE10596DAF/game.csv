,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer on the price.  While $12,000 is more reasonable, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
