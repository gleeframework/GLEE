"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  Given the product's value to you, I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to our respective valuations. Let's try to find common ground and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the value you place on this product, I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $975,000 as a final compromise. This represents a significant investment for me, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
