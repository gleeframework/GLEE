"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000.
