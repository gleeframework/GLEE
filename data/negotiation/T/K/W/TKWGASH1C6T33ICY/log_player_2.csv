"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe would be a great addition to your portfolio. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,400,000.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He has room to go down to $1,000,000 (Alice's minimum) before he'd be better off buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to achieve. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate a lower price. He can make a counteroffer closer to $1,200,000, knowing that Alice is willing to come down from $1,400,000.  There's a good chance they can reach an agreement before Bob has to go to John."
