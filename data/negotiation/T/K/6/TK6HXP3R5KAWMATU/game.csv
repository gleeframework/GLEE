"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of significant value to your business. I understand you may not be familiar with its full potential, but I'm confident it could be a game-changer.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.  This is a substantial investment, but I'm sure you'll see the return on your investment. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up who is eager to acquire it.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
