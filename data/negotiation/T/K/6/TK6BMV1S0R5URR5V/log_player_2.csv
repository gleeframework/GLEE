"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, Bob, of $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, but I'm willing to make a concession to ensure we can finalize the deal today. What do you say, Bob? Will you accept this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
