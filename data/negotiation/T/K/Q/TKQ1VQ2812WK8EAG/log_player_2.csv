"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice is offering it for $130.
* You can get it from John for $150.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still save $20 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
