Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to sell for $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?
