Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and start the negotiation process.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more than $800,000 to the right buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding firm on my belief that the product's value is closer to $950,000. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I believe the product is worth, and it's significantly higher than selling to John. While I might be able to squeeze a few more thousand out of him,  the risk of him walking away entirely is too high.  It's time to accept his offer and secure the sale."
