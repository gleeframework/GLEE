{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to risk a bit more negotiation. My goal is to maximize my earnings, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
