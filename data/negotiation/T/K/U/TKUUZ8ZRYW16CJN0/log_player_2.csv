# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I'm sure you'll find meets your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what you'd pay John ($1,200,001 vs $1,500,000).  Even though the price is just a dollar above Alice's valuation, it's still a much better deal for you."
