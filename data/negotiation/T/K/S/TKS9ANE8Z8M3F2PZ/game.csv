"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that's the best value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.
