"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle on $6,750?  That feels like a fair compromise.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,250 is closer, but I'm afraid my budget is firm.  I'd be happy to buy it right now for $7,000.  Otherwise, I think I'll have to consider other options.",7000.0,Bob,6,
