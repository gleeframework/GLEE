Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $800,000? I believe this might align better with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
