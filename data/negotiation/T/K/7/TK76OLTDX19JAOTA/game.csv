"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable to me, I'm hoping to make this work on a tighter budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to make this work on a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be totally transparent, I've got a hard limit at $800,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your hard limit is $800,000, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is as close as I can get to your limit while still making a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
