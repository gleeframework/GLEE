Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still make a larger profit by continuing to negotiate.  $10,000 is too low for me, especially considering Bob's initial willingness to pay $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering $11,000, which is still a good profit for me but closer to Bob's offer. This should encourage Bob to accept while ensuring I get a better price than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough to make me happy with the deal. Since I can sell to John for $8,000, which is my minimum, I'm going to take that option to ensure I don't lose out on potential profits."
