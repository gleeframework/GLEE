Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and still come out ahead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I can still do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $10,000, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid losing Bob as a buyer. This offer is still higher than Bob's counteroffer, but closer to his range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is too low for me to consider. With John offering $10,000, it's more beneficial to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
