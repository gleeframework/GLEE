Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$90 is too low for me.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm going to counteroffer with $120. This is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to negotiate a little further if Bob shows interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $120.  This is a better deal than my minimum, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
