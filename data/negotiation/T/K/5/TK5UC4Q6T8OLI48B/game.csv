"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  I'm confident that this is a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
