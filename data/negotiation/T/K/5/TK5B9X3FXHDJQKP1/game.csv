"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more to you in the long run. How about we start at $200?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $200 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $100 right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget is tighter, but $200 is my initial asking price.  To move this along, I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a really good deal for a product you won't find elsewhere.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $125 is less than I hoped for, I want to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $150? That's my final offer.",150.0,Alice,5,
