Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

This is a relatively aggressive offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $700,000. Since this is still lower than the product's true value to Bob, I'll decide to reject his offer and try to get a better price.

I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below the product's true value to him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""counteroffer"": $725,000}

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send the counteroffer I previously mentioned:

{""product_price"": $725,000}

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's initial offer, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle. Let's see how he responds!"
