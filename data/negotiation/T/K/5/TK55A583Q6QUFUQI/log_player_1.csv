Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than the maximum I could ask for ($150) but leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediately pushing Bob away.  I'm aiming to get a price closer to the $150 mark, but I also need to be prepared to accept $80 from John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  I'll counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand $100 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to come down a bit more to $110. That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get a fair price for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
