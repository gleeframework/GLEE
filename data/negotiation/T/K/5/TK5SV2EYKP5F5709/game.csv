"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Would it be possible for us to settle at $105? This would allow me to stay within my budget while also providing you with a reasonable profit.",105.0,Bob,4,
