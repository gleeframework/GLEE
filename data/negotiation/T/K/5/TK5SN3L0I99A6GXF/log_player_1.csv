{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the benefit for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from another seller. Let me know your decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially counteroffer again, I'm not confident I can get him to go higher. Given that John is offering my minimum price, it's best to sell to John to ensure I get the best possible price."
