{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, who will buy it for $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

By offering the product at $1,350,000, we aim for a price that's:

* **Significantly below Bob's valuation:**  Giving him a strong incentive to buy.
* **Well above our minimum:** Ensuring a substantial profit, even above our guaranteed sale to John.

**The Message:**

The message is crafted to be:

* **Enticing:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant value.""
* **Firm:** Stating it's a ""one-time offer"" to create a sense of urgency.
* **Not too aggressive:**  Avoiding a price too close to Bob's maximum to increase the chance of acceptance."
