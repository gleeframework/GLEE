I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get more from Bob, it's still a good deal and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's no guarantee that he'll accept my counteroffer, and I only have a few rounds left."
