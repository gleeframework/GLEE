"I appreciate the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're still trying to negotiate, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $925,000? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product.",875000.0,Bob,6,
