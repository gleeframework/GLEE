It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can potentially get a better price."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how Alice reacts. This price is still significantly lower than her offer, but it leaves room for negotiation."

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer was rejected. Buying from her saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John."
