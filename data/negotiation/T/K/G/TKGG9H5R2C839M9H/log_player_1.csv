{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for profit, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000  is significantly below its true value and potential for generating revenue. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers willing to meet my valuation."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I still think $1,050,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and potential for revenue. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below what John is offering. Bob is showing willingness to move towards our price point, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,012,500. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1012500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and our previous one. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $985,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and potential for revenue. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is increasing, but it's still substantially lower than John's guaranteed offer. We have time for further negotiation, and we don't want to leave a significant amount of money on the table by accepting prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price.  Let's make this simple - I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This is a firm offer and a great value for a product with this much potential.  I need a decision today as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are now getting very close to John's offer and have made a significant price reduction. We are creating a sense of urgency, and by stating a ""firm offer,"" we are signaling this is our final concession.  Bob is very likely to counter-offer, but this gives us a strong position to either accept a price very near our alternative or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your urgency, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $995,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go above this price. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is highly unlikely to go above his ""final offer."" Accepting would mean losing out on $205,000 compared to John's offer. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a relatively small potential gain. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario."
