Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your target price point, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I propose a price of $825,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 1-year warranty and priority support. This is a unique opportunity to get the product with added value.

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems pretty stuck on $825,000. It's time to start getting firmer and signal that we're willing to walk away if needed.  While the extras are nice, they don't significantly change the value proposition for us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the added perks, but my budget is firm. I can do $800,000, and that's my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to accept $800,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I propose a price of $815,000, and I'll throw in the additional perks I mentioned earlier, including the 1-year warranty and priority support. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation window. While we could try another round, it's unlikely she'll go much lower, and we risk her accepting our previous $800,000 offer anyway.  Getting the perks sweetens the deal slightly, making $815,000 an acceptable price at this point."
