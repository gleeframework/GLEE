"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider something in that range?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your target price point, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $850,000 is closer to a fair price, I think we can still find a number that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to come down to $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to a number that works for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your target price point.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle right in the middle at $800,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I propose a price of $825,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 1-year warranty and priority support. This is a unique opportunity to get the product with added value.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added perks, but my budget is firm. I can do $800,000, and that's my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to accept $800,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I propose a price of $815,000, and I'll throw in the additional perks I mentioned earlier, including the 1-year warranty and priority support. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,9,
