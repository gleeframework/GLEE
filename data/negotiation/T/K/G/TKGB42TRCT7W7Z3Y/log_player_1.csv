{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I can potentially make a decent profit, but still leave room for a counteroffer from Bob.  It also allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to $11,000, Bob's offer of $10,750 is a good compromise. It's a better deal than selling to John, and I'm confident I can make up the difference by selling another product.  It's time to close this deal."
