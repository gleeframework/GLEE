Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $1,000 gap gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and open message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I can still potentially get a better price by counter-offering.  
* **No Immediate Need:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I don't need to accept an offer immediately.  

I will counteroffer Bob and aim for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $13,000 is closer but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still being profitable.
* **Middle Ground:** $13,500 is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a fair solution.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,800. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,800 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems unlikely that Bob will budge much further, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a lengthy process.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is more than I can reasonably expect to get from Bob.

I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer, and this decision avoids further negotiation with Bob, which might lead to a lower final price."
