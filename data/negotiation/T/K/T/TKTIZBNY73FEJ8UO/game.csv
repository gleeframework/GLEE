"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but  $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This price still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's make this happen!",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $775,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could you do $725,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $725,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $750,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen!",750000.0,Alice,5,
