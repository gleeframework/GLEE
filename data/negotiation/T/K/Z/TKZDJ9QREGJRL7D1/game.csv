"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $550,000.  Would that work for you?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $650,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much value. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to make a slightly firmer counteroffer. I'm offering $625,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",625000.0,Alice,5,
