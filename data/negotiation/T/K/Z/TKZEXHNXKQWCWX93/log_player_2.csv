"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for a lower price than $120, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but I can only go up to $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  That way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

``` 

Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal for you.  You can save $40 compared to buying from John."
