Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my desire to get a good price with the risk of Bob rejecting it.  It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but I can only go up to $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
