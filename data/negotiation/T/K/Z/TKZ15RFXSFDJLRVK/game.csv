"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",16500.0,Alice,5,
