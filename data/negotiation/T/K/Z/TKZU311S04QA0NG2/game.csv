"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose the exact nature of it right now, I'm confident it has the potential to be extremely beneficial for the right person. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a price point I've carefully considered, taking into account both the product's inherent worth and the potential value it could bring to you. If you're interested, let's schedule a time to discuss it further.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
