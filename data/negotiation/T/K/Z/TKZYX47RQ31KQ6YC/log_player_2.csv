"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at $85. Let's work together to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's message is interesting. She's trying to establish a sense of collaboration and fairness, even hinting that the product is less valuable to her.  While her offer of $85 is decent, there's a good chance we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your collaborative approach.  While I see the value in the product, I was hoping to find something closer to $70. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Polite and Collaborative:** We maintain the positive tone set by Alice, acknowledging her offer and approach.
* **Ambitious but Reasonable:**  $70 is a significant drop from $85, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still being within a reasonable range.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Phrasing it as a question encourages Alice to respond and continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value we both place on the product, how about we aim for a price of $75? This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met us halfway, which is a good sign. However, there's still a potential $5 savings, and we haven't exhausted reasonable negotiation tactics yet.  We'll push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you at $72 if that works for you. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 72
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  We acknowledge her movement towards a deal, keeping the mood positive.
* **Small Concession:**  By offering $72, we signal flexibility but hold onto a small discount.
* **Sense of Finality:** The phrase ""fair compromise"" subtly implies we're reaching the end of our negotiation range."
