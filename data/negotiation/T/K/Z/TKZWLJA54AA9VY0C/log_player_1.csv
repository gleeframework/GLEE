"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $80 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 175} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $175 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $125. This is my final offer, let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have your budget, but $125 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $150 for the product. This is my final offer, let's make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125. It's a fair price for both of us, let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better price.  I've already offered my minimum price of $150, and Bob seems set on his offer of $125.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is the best option available to me at this time."
