Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a bit higher than what it's worth to you, but it's a truly unique item with tremendous value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $950,000 is still below my minimum, so it's worth exploring more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  It's a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I still feel like I can push for a better price. I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not under too much pressure.  I want to see if I can get Bob to meet my minimum before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to stick with my minimum price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of the product.  If you're serious about acquiring it, I believe this is the final offer you'll need to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
