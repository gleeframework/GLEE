"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  It's a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to stick with my minimum price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of the product.  If you're serious about acquiring it, I believe this is the final offer you'll need to accept.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
