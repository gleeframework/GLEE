"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  That's a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it a fair deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
