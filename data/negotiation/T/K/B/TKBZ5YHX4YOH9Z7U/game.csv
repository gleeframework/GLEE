,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is simply too low for this product. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1750000. It's a fair price that still allows you to secure a valuable asset.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1750000 is an improvement, I still feel there is room for further discussion. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1600000 still doesn't reflect the full value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go down to $1650000. This is a fair price that gives us both a win.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1550000 simply isn't enough to reflect the true value of this product. To be honest, I'm starting to feel like this deal isn't going to work out.  Let's compromise one last time â€“ I'll drop my price to $1600000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
