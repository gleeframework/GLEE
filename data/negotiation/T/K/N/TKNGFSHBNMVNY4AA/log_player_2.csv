Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we could push further, the potential savings are relatively small now compared to the risk of Alice walking away. Accepting at $1,020,000 still represents a significant discount from John's $1,500,000 price."
