"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by our previous customers. Given its quality and uniqueness, I believe it's worth more than $100. However, to make this opportunity attractive for you, I propose we set the price at $95. This way, both parties can benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits you.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $95 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, given its quality and my eagerness to purchase. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within your budget. I am willing to consider your offer, but I would like to suggest a price of $90 for the product. This still allows us to share the value of the product while accommodating your financial considerations. I hope this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm interested in the product, $90 is still a bit above my comfort zone. Let's split the difference and go with $87.50. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
