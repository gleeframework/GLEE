"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110.
* This means you're getting a discount and saving $10 compared to buying from John.
* Even though the product is worth $100 to Alice, that information is irrelevant to your decision. You're focused on your own value and getting the best deal possible."
