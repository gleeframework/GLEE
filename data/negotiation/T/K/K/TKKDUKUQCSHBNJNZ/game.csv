"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $800,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my value. How about $1,000,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering your estimate. Let's try to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a good compromise and still leaves you with a decent profit. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
