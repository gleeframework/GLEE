"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $800,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my value. How about $1,000,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering your estimate. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above his ideal price. He can try to negotiate further or buy from John for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a good compromise and still leaves you with a decent profit. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
