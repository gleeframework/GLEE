"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, it's worth more than $80 to me. Considering its worth to you is $100, I propose we come to an agreement that respects both our valuations. Would you be interested in discussing a price that falls between these two figures, perhaps around $95? This way, we can ensure a fair transaction that maximizes satisfaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
