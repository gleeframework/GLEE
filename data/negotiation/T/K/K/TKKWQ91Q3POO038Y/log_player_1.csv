{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to explore potential for a win-win scenario. I am also aiming for a price close to my minimum acceptable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. There's still potential to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $9,800 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I have a few more rounds left and I believe I can get a better offer.  I'll try to push for a slightly higher price in my counteroffer."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,800 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget and the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm continuing to try and find a middle ground by offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
