$1,100,000 is still a bit high, but it's a good sign that Alice is willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Alice is getting close to my target price, but $1,100,000 is still too high. I'll counteroffer one last time to try and get her closer to my price. If she rejects, I'll buy from John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target, but $1,095,000 is still more than I want to pay.  I'm only one round away from having to buy from John, so I might as well save some money and go with John's offer.  It's not ideal, but it's the best choice in this situation."
