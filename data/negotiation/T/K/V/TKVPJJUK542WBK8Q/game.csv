"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us both walk away with a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to make a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,050,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet at $1,075,000. This represents a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",1075000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1,090,000, which is a fair compromise. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1090000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge further. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $1,095,000. This is the absolute limit I'm willing to go to. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1095000.0,Alice,9,
