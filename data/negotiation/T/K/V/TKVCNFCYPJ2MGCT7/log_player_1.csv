Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a significant discount and a fair offer considering the quality and potential return on investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $16,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and this offer exceeds John's. Taking $16,000 now is a good deal."
