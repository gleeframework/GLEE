"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've expressed interest in the product, and it's a significant discount from my original offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it's closer to my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've expressed interest in the product, and it's a compromise on both our parts.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
