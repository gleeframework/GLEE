"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by negotiating.  $600,000 is a significant amount, and there's potential to get a better price. We'll see what Alice's counteroffer is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 2/3 of Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also gives Alice room to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $500,000, which is still a good price, but I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $450,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still believe I can get a better price than $500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up to $550,000. While I'd prefer a lower price, we're getting close to my initial target. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, and  $550,000 is still a good price compared to buying from John. It's time to accept the offer."
