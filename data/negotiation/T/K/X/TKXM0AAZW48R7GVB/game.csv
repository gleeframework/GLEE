"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $120. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $110. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. How about $120? That's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and we can both walk away happy.",120.0,Bob,4,
