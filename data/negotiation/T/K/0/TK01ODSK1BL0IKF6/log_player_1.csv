Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows for room for negotiation and also indicates my willingness to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows you to stay within your budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $10,250 as a counteroffer. This is closer to my budget while still allowing you to receive a fair price for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While $10,250 is a better offer, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about $10,400? This gives us both a fair price, and keeps the deal moving forward. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I would like to counter with $10,350. This brings us closer to my budget while still providing you with a reasonable profit. I hope this helps move the deal forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and I've already spent several rounds negotiating. It's time to close the deal before I risk losing Bob completely or needing to sell to John at a lower price."
