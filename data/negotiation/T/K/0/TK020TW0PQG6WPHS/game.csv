"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this product, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
