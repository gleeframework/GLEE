"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down further in price.  There's a chance to save even more money."
