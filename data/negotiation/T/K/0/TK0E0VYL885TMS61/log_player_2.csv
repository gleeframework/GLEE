"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  While $140 is close to my limit, there's still room to save."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! The product looks great, but I'm working with a bit of a tighter budget. Would you consider $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. There's a chance she might counter, giving me a better idea of her lowest acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for a product worth $150 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice coming down to $125 is a good deal. It's only slightly more than John's price, and there's a chance further negotiation might not yield a better result.  I'll accept the offer."
