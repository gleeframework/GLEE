"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that starting price is quite steep. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $2,000,000? This price reflects the product's immense value while still representing a significant investment on your part.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my limit.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. It seems we both recognize the inherent value in this product. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the unique advantages this product offers.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're reaching a critical point in this negotiation. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but $1,800,000 is simply not feasible for me. My final offer is $1,300,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, accepting $1,300,000 would mean selling myself short on the true value of this product. To avoid that, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can go as low as $1,600,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it reflects a fair deal given the product's worth. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options, as much as I'd prefer to work with you.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
