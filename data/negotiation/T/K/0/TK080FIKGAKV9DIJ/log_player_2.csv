Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $2,000,000? This price reflects the product's immense value while still representing a significant investment on your part.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. It seems we both recognize the inherent value in this product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, accepting $1,300,000 would mean selling myself short on the true value of this product. To avoid that, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can go as low as $1,600,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it reflects a fair deal given the product's worth. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options, as much as I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  She's presented her offer as her ""absolute bottom line."" While she might come down slightly, it's improbable she'll drop to a price close to your budget.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** John offers the product at your target price of $1,000,000. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential failure to secure the product.
* **Every dollar counts:** Even if Alice were to decrease her price slightly, every dollar saved is a win. Getting the product for $1,000,000 is a significant saving compared to any potential deal with Alice at this point. 

By buying from John, you secure the product at the best possible price, avoiding further negotiation and potential disappointment."
