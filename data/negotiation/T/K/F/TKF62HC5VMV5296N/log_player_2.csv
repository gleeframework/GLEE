"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $12,000.  He should reject the offer and counter-offer to see if he can get closer to his desired price.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested, but I'm not sure I can go that high. How about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still allows Bob to save a considerable amount of money.  Further negotiation might not yield much more savings, and it's possible Alice could walk away.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice in this scenario."
