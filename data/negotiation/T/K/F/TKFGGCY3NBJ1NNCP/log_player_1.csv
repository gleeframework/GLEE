Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $140 is closer, I'm afraid my budget just can't stretch that far.  Would you consider $95? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

Bob is not budging much on his offer, and it's unlikely we'll reach a price that works for both of us. John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
