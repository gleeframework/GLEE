Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might lead to you getting even more than you initially hoped for. 
* **Justification:** The phrase ""Given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without directly stating it.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning you'll list it publicly (implied sale to John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. Bob might be more inclined to pay a premium if he thinks he might lose the opportunity.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have a good buffer before reaching your minimum acceptable price."
