"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price.  John's offer of $1,200,000 sets your upper limit, so there's room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price."
