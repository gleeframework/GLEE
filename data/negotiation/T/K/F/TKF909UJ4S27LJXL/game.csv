"I understand you're on a budget, Bob! However, I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $110 to make it worth my while. How about we say $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. How about $105?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go below $115. I think the product is worth it, and I've already come down quite a bit. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
