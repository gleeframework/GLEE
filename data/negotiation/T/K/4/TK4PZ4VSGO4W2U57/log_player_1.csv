"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. It's important to get a good starting point in this scenario."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there's still room to negotiate closer to my desired price.  I'll reject this offer and counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a price that's closer to what the product is worth to me. I believe this is a fair counteroffer that will encourage Bob to continue negotiating."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, I still have room for improvement. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
