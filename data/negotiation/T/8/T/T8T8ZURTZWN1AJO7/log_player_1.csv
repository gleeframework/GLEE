Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $1,000,000.  This would allow me to make a good profit while giving you a fair price.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a more agreeable price. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to proceed with the purchase and giving you a solid return on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
