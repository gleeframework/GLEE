"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,500.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8,500? It's still a fair price, considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However,  $8,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
