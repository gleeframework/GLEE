"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum price and saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer is the best way to acquire the product while saving the most money."
