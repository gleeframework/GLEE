Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit. Ideally, you want to get as close to $1,000,000 from Bob as possible.

**The Strategy**

You're in a strong position. You have a guaranteed buyer, giving you leverage. However, greed could lead to Bob rejecting your offer. Here's the approach:

1. **Start High, But Be Realistic:** Don't start at an outrageous price.  Begin somewhere below Bob's maximum but above your minimum.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Your initial offer shouldn't be your final price. Give the impression that you might be willing to come down a little.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 950000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  You acknowledge the product's value while positioning the price as a ""starting point,"" opening the door for Bob to negotiate.
* **The Price:** $950,000 is a strong opening. It's below Bob's maximum, making it tempting, but leaves you room to potentially negotiate down to a still-profitable price.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject your initial offer.  You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting John's guaranteed offer.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  This scenario highlights the importance of negotiation in business. A well-structured offer can lead to a win-win situation."
