"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully developed and it's worth at least $8,000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
