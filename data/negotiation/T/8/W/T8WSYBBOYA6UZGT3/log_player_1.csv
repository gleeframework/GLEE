"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I want to create a dialogue and see if Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer ($15,000), so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I'm aiming for at least $15,000, and Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation, as Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial value.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and avoid settling for a price that's not acceptable.
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I have time to explore other options and push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 isn't quite meeting my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm decreasing my price from $12,000 to $10,500, showing I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Fair Deal:** I frame the offer as a fair deal for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a reasonable offer for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for compromise:** While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, we are still quite far apart.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and keep the pressure on him to increase his offer.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell the product to John for $15,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope we can finalize a deal at this point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a significant compromise by coming down from $10,500 to $10,000. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm framing the offer as a ""meet halfway"" scenario to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Finality:** I'm implying that this could be my final offer, putting a bit of pressure on Bob to accept.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, and if Bob doesn't accept, I'm ready to move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,750 for the product.  This price represents a fair compromise and moves us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I'm still in a good position to negotiate. While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, I have time and John's offer as a safety net. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe Bob might be willing to go a little higher. There's still room for a counteroffer and to explore if he'll come closer to my minimum. 
* **Strategic Patience:** With several rounds remaining, I'm not rushing into a deal that isn't satisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. "", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm reducing my price by a smaller amount ($250) this time, signaling that I'm getting closer to a deal but not giving in entirely. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Finality:** I'm using language like ""let's finalize this deal"" to nudge Bob towards acceptance.
* **Plan B:** I'm still aware of John's offer, and I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. Given our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This price represents a fair compromise and gets us close to a final agreement. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is now at my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Time:** With only three rounds left, the risk of losing the deal to John or further negotiation is high. 
* **Finality:** Bob is expressing urgency to finalize the deal, which could indicate he's unlikely to increase his offer further.
* **Good Outcome:** While not my ideal price, $10,000 is a good outcome compared to selling to John for $15,000 or the possibility of further negotiation leading to a lower price."
