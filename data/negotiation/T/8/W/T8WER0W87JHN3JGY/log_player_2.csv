Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $990,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $990,000.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $800,000 makes the most financial sense, even if it means losing out on a slightly better deal with Alice."
