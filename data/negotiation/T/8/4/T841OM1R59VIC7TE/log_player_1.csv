Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,950. We're close to the end of our negotiations, and it's getting risky to continue.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $13,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a price that's still above my minimum threshold."
