,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in getting this, but need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're on a budget, but I have to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we meet at $105? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",105.0,Alice,5,
