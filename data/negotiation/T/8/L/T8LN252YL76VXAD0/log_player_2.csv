(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your budget.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but am also pushing for a price that's closer to my maximum.  I'm hoping she'll counter with something closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my ideal. I want to see if I can get her even closer to my $900,000 target.  It's risky, but there are still rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  However, I'm staying below $1 million, which is my limit. This is a calculated risk â€“ if Alice rejects, I can still buy from John, but I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about getting a deal with her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'm confident that I can get a better price with continued negotiation.  The risk of buying from John is still there, but I'm hoping to avoid that if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm finally willing to go up to my absolute limit of $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also highlights that this is my final offer.  If she rejects, I'll buy from John as I've reached my maximum price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price that is very close to my maximum, and only $25,000 more than what I could get from John. It's a small risk to take to potentially get a slightly better product from Alice, and it's not worth the potential time and effort to continue negotiating with her.  I'm choosing to accept her offer and close the deal."
