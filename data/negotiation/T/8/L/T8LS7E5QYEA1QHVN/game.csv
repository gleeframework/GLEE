"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  That's a significant reduction from my original offer and still gives you a great value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, so how about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $108.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this and move on.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",107.0,Bob,6,
