"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I'm well above my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room:** I don't want to start too high and scare Bob off, especially since I have the John backup. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer is also about gauging Bob's enthusiasm and getting him invested in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price. Bob's message suggests he's interested but wants to see if he can get a better deal.  I'll counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly undeniable.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000? This reflects my willingness to be flexible while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting a price halfway between his offer ($1,200,000) and my previous one ($1,400,000), I signal a willingness to negotiate but also stand firm on the product's value.
* **Framing:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" for both parties to make the compromise more appealing and maintain a positive tone. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, and I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than my backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $1,250,000. Let's get this deal finalized. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but I'm still willing to push for a better price. Bob's eagerness to ""finalize the deal"" suggests he's willing to move a bit more. I'll counter with a smaller concession to see if I can squeeze out a little more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and that tells me it would be a valuable asset in your hands. Let's close the gap - how about $1,275,000 and we have a deal?"", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** By only reducing my ask by $25,000 this time, I'm signaling that I'm reaching my limit and putting the ball in Bob's court.
* **Emphasize Value to Bob:** I'm reiterating that his interest validates the product's worth, subtly reminding him why he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Call to Action:**  The phrase ""and we have a deal"" aims to instill a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to finalize the negotiation."
