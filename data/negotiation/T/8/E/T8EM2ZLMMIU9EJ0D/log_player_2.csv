"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she'll come down significantly, or utilize the option to buy from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on her price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, I have the option to buy from John for $120 if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $150 is more than I'm willing to pay, and it's the same price Alice values the product at.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate down from $150. 
* **John as Leverage:** I can use the option to buy from John for $120 as leverage to encourage Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $150 is closer, I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $115? That's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  Increasing my offer to $115 shows Alice I'm willing to move, but not significantly. 
* **Staying Below Limit:** It's important to remain well below my $120 maximum and leave room for a potential final counter-offer from Alice.
* **Justification:**  Giving a reason like ""on a budget"" makes the offer seem more genuine."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and call it $132.50? It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Even though Alice is coming down, $132.50 is still above my $120 limit.
* **Negotiation Power:** I have time and the option of buying from John, giving me leverage to push for a better price.
* **Final Push:** I'll use the next round to make a final offer close to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you negotiating. I'm willing to go up to $118, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair offer considering I can buy it elsewhere for a similar price."",
""product_price"": 118
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last attempt to get the product from Alice before resorting to John. 
* **Slight Increase:** The increase to $118 shows willingness to compromise but stays firm.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning the possibility of buying elsewhere adds subtle pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, it's time for Alice to decide if she wants to make a deal."
