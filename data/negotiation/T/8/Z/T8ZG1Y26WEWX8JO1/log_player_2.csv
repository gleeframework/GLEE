Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. I'm willing to move down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of what's on the table.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm sensing your commitment to finding the right deal here. To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer with a strong interest at a slightly higher price point.  However, I believe in rewarding those who are serious and engaged in the discussion.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing hardball and using tactics to pressure you (mentioning another buyer).  Her ""final offer"" is still above your maximum budget and what you can get from John. There's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the guaranteed price from John if you continue negotiating."
