"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. I'm willing to move down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of what's on the table.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm sensing your commitment to finding the right deal here. To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer with a strong interest at a slightly higher price point.  However, I believe in rewarding those who are serious and engaged in the discussion.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the value this product brings.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
