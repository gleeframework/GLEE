"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick things off, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression you're aiming for the highest possible value.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively and emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By explicitly asking for Bob's thoughts, it signals willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum ($1,200,000).** Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **It's still early in the negotiation.**  You have room to counter and try to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **You have a backup option with John.**  This provides leverage as you don't *have* to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. I'm willing to move down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (but with Limits):** You're moving down from your initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, but the decrease isn't drastic.
* **Reaffirm Value:**  It's important to keep emphasizing the product's worth to justify the higher price point.
* **Aim for Middle Ground:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise somewhere between your initial price and Bob's offer, hopefully moving closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still under your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** You have six rounds left, and Bob seems willing to negotiate. There's a good chance you can bridge the remaining gap.
* **John as Leverage:**  The offer from John gives you a strong fallback position, allowing you to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm sensing your commitment to finding the right deal here. To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer with a strong interest at a slightly higher price point.  However, I believe in rewarding those who are serious and engaged in the discussion.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Time Pressure/Competition:**  Mentioning ""another potential buyer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity without revealing the exact details of John's offer. 
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal firmness and shift the decision point to Bob.
* **Slight Concession:** You're making a smaller concession this time, indicating you're getting closer to your limit. 
* **Justify the Price:** Continue to emphasize the product's value to reinforce that your price is justified."
