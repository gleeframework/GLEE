{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting ripped off.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves room for you to potentially make a higher profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your terms and respond.

By setting a price slightly above Bob's valuation, we open the possibility of securing a better price while still leaving room for negotiation if needed. Remember, we always have the option of selling to John for our minimum price if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a better price, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
