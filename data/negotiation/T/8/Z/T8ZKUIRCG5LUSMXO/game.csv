"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $80. I'm willing to sell it to you for $85. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal!",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $83, which is just a small increase from your last offer. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price.",83.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $83, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can offer $81.50. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",81.5,Bob,6,
