"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
