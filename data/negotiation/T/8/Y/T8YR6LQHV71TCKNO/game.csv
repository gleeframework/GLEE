"Alice,  $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 represents its true value, I understand we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
