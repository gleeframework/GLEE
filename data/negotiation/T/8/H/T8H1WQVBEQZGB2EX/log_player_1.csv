Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your minimum price, mentioning ""value"" hints that you believe the product is worth a significant amount.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrasing the offer as a ""proposal"" and asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" keeps the conversation open and non-confrontational. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know you have John as a backup buyer, but getting a higher price from Bob is ideal."
