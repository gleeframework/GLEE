It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can offer a lower price and see if she's willing to budge."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a better price than John's offer.  It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product."
