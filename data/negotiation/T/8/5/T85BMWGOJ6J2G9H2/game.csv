"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the value of the product, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. ",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will bring significant value to your endeavors. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied. ",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $1,850,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I need the deal to land a bit higher to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's settle at $1,925,000, and we have an agreement. This is my final offer.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,925,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I can go up to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.  ",1900000.0,Bob,6,
