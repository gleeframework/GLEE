"Alice, your product is attractive, but $1200000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering the value it holds for you, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer for the product is $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1000000. This represents a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
