"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This price is still a great value for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is truly significant, and $1,050,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider closing the deal at $1,120,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, don't you think?",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still hesitant at $1,120,000.  I'm willing to go to $1,080,000. This is a fair price considering our earlier discussion and allows for a smooth and quick transaction.  Let's try to make this happen.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground here. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,100,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
