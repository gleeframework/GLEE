Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges the product's value to Bob while still allowing for a potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident I can get closer to my target through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum price, and I'm feeling a bit impatient.  It's better to close the deal now and avoid further negotiation."
