# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $100,000."
