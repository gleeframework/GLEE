Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $2,250,000 represents a significant 50% markup.
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still secure a price well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth *to you*, the message hints at its value to justify the high price.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with potentially losing Bob as a buyer if he finds the initial offer too high. However, it maximizes your potential profit if successful."
