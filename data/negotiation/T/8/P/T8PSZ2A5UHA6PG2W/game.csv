"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far off from that price point. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a reasonable price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",8500.0,Alice,5,
