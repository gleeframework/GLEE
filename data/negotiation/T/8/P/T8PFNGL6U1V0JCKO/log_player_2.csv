"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us. Let's find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate with Alice further.**  You can counter with a lower price, potentially reaching a compromise. 
* **Buying from John is the worst option.** It will cost you the most and leave you with the least amount of money."
