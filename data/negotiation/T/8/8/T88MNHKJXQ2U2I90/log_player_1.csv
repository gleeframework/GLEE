"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is a better offer than Bob's initial $8,000, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $9,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's settle on $9,100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it will let us close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I would like to get more, Bob's offer of $9,100 is still below my minimum of $10,000, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk getting less from Bob."
