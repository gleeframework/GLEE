(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has returned to her original asking price. While I could continue negotiating, we're running out of time. At this point, buying from John for $1,500,000 is the most sensible choice. It guarantees I get the product within my budget, and avoids the risk of Alice continuing to refuse my offers."
