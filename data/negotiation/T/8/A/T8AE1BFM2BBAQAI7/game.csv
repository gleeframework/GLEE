"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,000 right now. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to come away happy.",14000.0,Bob,4,
