"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($925,000) is below your maximum price ($1,000,000).
* However, you know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. 
* There's a chance you could get Alice to lower her price, getting you a better deal. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
