Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is of high value to you, and I'm offering it to you before considering other buyers. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers $1,000,000, Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  There's an opportunity to sell significantly higher.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a profit well above John's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and implies scarcity by mentioning ""other buyers."" This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if Bob doesn't act."
