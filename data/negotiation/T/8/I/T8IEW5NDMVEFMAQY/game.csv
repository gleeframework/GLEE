"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is a significant amount, it doesn't fully reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This still represents a significant investment for you, and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can work something out.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we split the difference and settle at $1275000? This would allow both of us to close the deal and be satisfied with the outcome.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
