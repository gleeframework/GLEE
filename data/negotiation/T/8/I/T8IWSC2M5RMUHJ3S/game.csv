,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you considering my product.  $11,000 is a bit low for me, as I believe the product's value is higher than that.  To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to lower the price to $15,500.  This price reflects the product's true worth while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $15,500 is still quite a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's value and the market price.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $12,500.  This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a deal.  $12,500 is still a bit lower than I'm aiming for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,500? This price recognizes the value of the product while also allowing for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",13500.0,Alice,7,
