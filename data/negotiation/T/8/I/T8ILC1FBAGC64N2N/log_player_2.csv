"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. It's worth $100 to me, but I'm offering it to you for $120. I believe it's worth even more than that to you, given its benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum price and above John's offer. It makes more sense to buy from John at the lower price."
