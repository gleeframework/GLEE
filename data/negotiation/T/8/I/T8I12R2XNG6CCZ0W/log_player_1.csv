Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $900,000 is a significant amount, I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I'm still confident this product holds significant value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I can't go lower.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think the price is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise, and it's above my minimum price of $1,000,000. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by trying to push for more."
