"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,400,000 is still above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,250,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it works within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1350000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $1,350,000 is higher than his ideal price, it's still within his budget and represents a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away or demanding a higher price."
