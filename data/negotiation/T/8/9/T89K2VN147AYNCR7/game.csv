"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1200000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1250000? This is still a great deal for you, and it works within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1350000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
