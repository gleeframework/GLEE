"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $7,750?  That's a significant step up from my previous offer, and I'm sure we can agree that it's a fair price.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be completely honest with you. I have another offer for a similar product at a lower price. I'm still very interested in yours, but I can't justify going higher than $8,000. If that's not possible, I completely understand, but I needed to be upfront about my situation.",8000.0,Bob,6,
