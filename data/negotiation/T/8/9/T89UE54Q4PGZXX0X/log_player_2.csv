"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its exceptional quality and functionality, it's valued at $10,000 by many. Considering its worth to you, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored for you, so please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000 and significantly higher than her own valuation of $8,000. 
* By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John at $10,000. 
* There's a chance Alice might come back with a better offer since she's motivated to sell. Even if she doesn't, you haven't lost anything by rejecting and can still buy from John."
