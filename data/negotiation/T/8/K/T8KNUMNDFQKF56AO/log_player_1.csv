{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your $8,000 floor, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is less than what Bob thinks the product is worth, making it appealing to him. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  This sets the stage for a potential negotiation without being too aggressive.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still above my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment. "", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,750 is a good price, and it's close to the middle ground we were both aiming for. It's definitely a better deal than selling to John for $8,000."
