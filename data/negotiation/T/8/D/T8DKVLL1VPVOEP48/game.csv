"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at a price of $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,500 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $11,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,250.  This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you say?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,250 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,625. This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. How about we settle this right now at $11,950?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain.",11950.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm very close to accepting, but $11,950 is still slightly higher than my budget.  How about we split the difference at $11,850? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",11850.0,Bob,6,
