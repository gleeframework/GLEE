Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. Bob is willing to pay a significant amount ($800,000), so there's room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $950,000 is a strong opening. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for him to negotiate down while still securing a great deal for myself. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion. This keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above the $1,000,000 fallback.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I have the security of John's guaranteed purchase. This puts me in a strong negotiating position, allowing me to potentially counter Bob's offer or proceed with John knowing I've secured the best possible outcome."
