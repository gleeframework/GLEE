Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal. It also opens the door for further conversation, making it more likely he'll accept or counter-offer rather than just rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $110.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
