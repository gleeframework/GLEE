# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
