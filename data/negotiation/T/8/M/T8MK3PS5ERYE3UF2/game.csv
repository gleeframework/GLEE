"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've personally invested a great deal in and I know it can make a significant impact. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a price that reflects the true value of the product, but I'm open to discussing it further.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe you have the potential to maximize its potential. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
