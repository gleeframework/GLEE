"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product. It's still a great price for a unique item, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this transaction.",9500.0,Bob,4,
