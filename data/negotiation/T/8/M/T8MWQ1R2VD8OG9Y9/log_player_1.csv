Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.  I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I have room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
