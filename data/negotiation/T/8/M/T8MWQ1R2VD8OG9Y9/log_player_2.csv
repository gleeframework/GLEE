{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  This gives Alice room to counter, but also signals Bob is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good price, Bob's initial offer of $750,000 was rejected, indicating Alice is likely willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting and counter-offering again shows Bob is serious about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
