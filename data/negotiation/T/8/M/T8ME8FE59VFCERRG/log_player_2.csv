# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. This is a more reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a great price. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,200. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $8,000."
