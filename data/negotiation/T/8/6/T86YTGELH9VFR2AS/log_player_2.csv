"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $800,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a substantial saving compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for Bob. While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his next counteroffer, leading to a stalemate or forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a good deal and avoids further potential risk."
