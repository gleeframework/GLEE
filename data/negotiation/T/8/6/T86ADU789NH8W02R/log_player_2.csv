"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $150 to him, he can afford to pay up to that amount. However, Alice's offer of $140 is still too high.  It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $120 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's closer to that value. This counteroffer shows his willingness to negotiate and could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still slightly higher than Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer.  Considering he has limited rounds and the risk of having to buy from John for $150, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. It secures a good price while minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation."
