Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll find it extremely valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, giving you a good profit margin.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate up from your offer. This makes it more likely he'll accept or counteroffer.

**Important Note:**  The success of this negotiation depends on Bob's willingness to pay, and how comfortable you are with taking risks. If Bob doesn't counteroffer or seems unwilling to meet you halfway, it might be time to move on to John and his guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $12,000 and your desired profit margin.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can get closer to your desired price.  If he's unwilling to budge, you can always fall back to selling to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,250 isn't your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000, ensuring a decent profit. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's a risk Bob will walk away, leaving you with only John's offer.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice, securing a solid profit while minimizing risk."
