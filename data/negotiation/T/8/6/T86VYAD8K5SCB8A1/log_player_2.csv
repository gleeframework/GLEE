Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower.  It's better to secure the deal at $110 than risk her raising the price or the negotiation failing completely."
