"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is way above your budget. You need to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a deal.  Buying from John is always an option, but you might be able to save more money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and allowing for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $1,100,000 and my valuation of the product is substantial. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This takes into account its true worth and leaves us both with a reasonable outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high.  While it's closer to your budget, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. You should try to negotiate a lower price. You have 7 rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating. Buying from John is an option, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a valuation for the product, but $1,300,000 is still out of my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,200,000. This reflects a significant commitment from my end, and I believe it's a fair offer given both our respective valuations. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
