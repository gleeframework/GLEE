I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Even though you could buy from John for $1,200,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $200,000.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
