"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your continued negotiation, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a figure closer to the midpoint of our previous offers. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our shared desire to make this deal work.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still slightly below my desired price.  Given our ongoing discussion and desire to reach an agreement, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,162,500.  This offer reflects a genuine effort to compromise and finalize this deal.",1162500.0,Alice,7,
