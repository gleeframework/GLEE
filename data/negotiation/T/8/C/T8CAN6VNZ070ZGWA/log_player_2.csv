{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice.  $5,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $4,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it gives us some room to negotiate.  We'll see if Alice is willing to meet us halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer. It's worth seeing if I can get a better price by rejecting again and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $4,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my ideal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer keeps going up. I'm not willing to pay $6,000. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $5,000. This is still below Alice's last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping that Alice will come down to meet me in the middle."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting too high, and I don't want to risk going any further.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000."
