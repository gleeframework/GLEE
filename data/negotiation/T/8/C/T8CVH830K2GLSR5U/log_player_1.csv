Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers and am open to discussing this further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn even more.
* **Strong Opening:** The $1,100,000 price is a strong starting point, reflecting the product's high value while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:** Mentioning the ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies I have other interested parties (even if it's just John). This creates a sense of urgency and potential competition.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the conversation open, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price. 

This strategy balances securing a good deal with Bob against the guaranteed sale to John."
