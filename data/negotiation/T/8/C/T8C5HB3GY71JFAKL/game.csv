"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a one-time opportunity for you to acquire a product that can be very valuable to your business.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?
