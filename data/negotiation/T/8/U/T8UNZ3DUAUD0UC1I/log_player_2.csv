"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so feel free to share any thoughts you might have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your budget. It's a good starting point to reject and counteroffer. You want to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects my maximum budget and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $1,900,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You have a solid alternative in John, who is offering the product for a price within your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your ideal price, but you should be prepared to accept John's offer if Alice doesn't budge significantly."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still beyond what I can currently afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000 for the product. This offer reflects a significant price reduction from your initial proposal and represents a fair compromise that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
