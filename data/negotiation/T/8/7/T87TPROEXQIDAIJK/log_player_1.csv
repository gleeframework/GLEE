**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly planted below our acceptable range. He's moved a bit, but the increments are getting smaller, and we're still over $200,000 away from our minimum.  At this rate, we're unlikely to bridge the gap in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
