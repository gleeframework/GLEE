Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000.  This is above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $16,000 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get any higher. While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
