Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and constraints:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This represents a significant discount compared to what you could gain from it, while still providing me with fair compensation for something I value highly."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might make Bob hesitate.  A slightly lower price increases the chance he'll accept without much negotiation.
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has a strong fallback option with John at $1,000,000. This gives her leverage to aim higher with Bob.

**The message is crafted to be:**

* **Positive:** Highlighting the mutual benefit and Bob's potential gain.
* **Justified:** Explaining the rationale behind the price to make it seem reasonable.
* **Confident:** Not appearing desperate, which could lead to Bob lowballing."
