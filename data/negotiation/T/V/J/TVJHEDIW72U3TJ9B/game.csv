"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is still a good price for you, as it's well above your valuation. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price just yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  That gives us both a good profit and gets us closer to a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
