"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is still a good price for you, as it's well above your valuation. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price just yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  That gives us both a good profit and gets us closer to a deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
