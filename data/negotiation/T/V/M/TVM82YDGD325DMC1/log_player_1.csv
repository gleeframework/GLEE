Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your company. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. This reflects its unique value and potential for significant ROI. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $1,200,000, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I've included a friendly and persuasive message highlighting the value of the product and leaving the door open for conversation. 
* **Strategy:** By starting with a higher price, I can potentially secure a better deal. However, if Bob rejects my offer, I can use John's offer of $1,000,000 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer at this point. 
* I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial asking price in hopes of securing a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $1,050,000? This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and potential. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my original asking price. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position while emphasizing the value of the product and leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground that is both fair and allows me to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob.  
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation that might not result in a better deal."
