{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This sets a strong starting point and allows room for negotiation.  I'm confident that the product is worth more to Bob than $800,000, as that's my floor price.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my floor price, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum right away. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair price given that I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $850,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my floor price and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for $800,000."
