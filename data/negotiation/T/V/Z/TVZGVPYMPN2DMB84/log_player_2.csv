Alice's offer:

This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.

I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.
