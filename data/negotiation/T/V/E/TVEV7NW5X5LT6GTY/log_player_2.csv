"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $12,000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Considering the market value and the benefits it offers, I suggest we aim for a price slightly above $10,000 but not exceeding $15,000. Let's schedule a call or meeting to further discuss this opportunity and find a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to your response.
