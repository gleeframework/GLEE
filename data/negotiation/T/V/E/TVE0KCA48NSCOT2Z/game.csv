"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $110, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",112.0,Alice,5,
