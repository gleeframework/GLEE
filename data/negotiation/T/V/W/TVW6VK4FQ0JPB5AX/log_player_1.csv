"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I believe the product is worth more than that, and I have 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm going to hold out for a better offer. I'm confident that the product's value justifies a higher price, and I still have 6 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm still hoping for a better price, I'm running out of time.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm not confident that Bob will come up much further. With only 4 rounds left, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
