"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $925,000? This gives us both a good deal. ",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $880,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $880,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise again - how about $900,000?  It's a fair price that's closer to both of our positions. ",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $890,000. I think this is a very fair offer considering the value of the product and the current market.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and while I appreciate your efforts, $890,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $905,000? This feels like a fair compromise that we can both agree on.",905000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  However, I need you to move a bit more for us to reach a deal.  Would you consider $895,000?",895000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's close this deal at $900,000. This is a very fair price for the product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm willing to accept this offer and finalize the sale.",900000.0,Alice,9,
