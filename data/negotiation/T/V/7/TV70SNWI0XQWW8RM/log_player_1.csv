Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John.  Therefore, we start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to counter-offer, and we can then slowly lower the price, aiming for somewhere above our guaranteed $15,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Alice's willingness to make a deal. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your desired approach and assessment of Bob's negotiating style, you could adjust the initial offer and messaging."
