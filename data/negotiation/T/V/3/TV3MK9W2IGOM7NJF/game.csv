"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's potential and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said,  $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,375,000 is still quite a bit below what I consider a fair price for this product. To be clear, I have another buyer ready at a higher price, but I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $1,600,000. This reflects the true value and potential of the product.
