While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 makes the most sense at this point.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  I'm still making a $600,000 profit over my minimum. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out longer risks Bob walking away or me missing other opportunities. 
* **Bird in Hand:** A firm offer now is better than the uncertainty of future counteroffers."
