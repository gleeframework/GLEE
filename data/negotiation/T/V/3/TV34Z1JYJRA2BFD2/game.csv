"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
