"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm going to need $10,000 to make this work. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I think that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.",8500.0,Bob,4,
