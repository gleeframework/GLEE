{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's minimum value while still leaving room for further negotiation. Offering $1,250,000 shows Bob is serious about buying but also leaves some room for Alice to compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and he has more rounds to negotiate. By rejecting, Bob can make another counteroffer and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal. $1,300,000 is closer to Alice's potential acceptance point, but still gives her some room to negotiate if she wants."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a better price without having to buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to Alice's desired price point.  $1,350,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This offer is also still under Bob's maximum budget, leaving him some room to maneuver in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget. There are only three rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will lower her price significantly enough for Bob to get a better deal. It's more efficient for Bob to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
