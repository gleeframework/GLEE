Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I'll start with a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $1,250,000}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I'm trying to earn as much money as possible, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since his offer was $1,150,000, I'll increase it by $25,000 to make it more appealing. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $1,175,000}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've sent the counteroffer to Bob. Here it is again:

{""product_price"": $1,175,000}

Now it's Bob's turn again. He can either accept this offer, reject it and make a new counteroffer, or reject it and I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is now at my minimum price! I've been trying to get the best deal possible, but I think it's time to consider selling the product to Bob. After all, I can get my minimum price of $1,200,000, which is a good deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000."
