Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Value Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Goal:** The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he rejects the initial offer, you can progressively lower it, knowing you have John as a fallback option at your desired minimum."
