Round 3
Alice's offer:

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,250 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  You're able to get the product for $10,500, which is only $500 more than what John is selling it for.  Since you have limited rounds, it's worth it to take this deal and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer again or running out of rounds before you can purchase from John."
