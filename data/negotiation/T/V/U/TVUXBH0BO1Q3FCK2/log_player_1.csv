"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $10,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'll try to counter-offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to get the product without going over my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,250 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
