"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500 right now. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to get the product without going over my limit.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,250 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
