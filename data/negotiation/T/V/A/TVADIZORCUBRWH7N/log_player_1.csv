"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential gain he could achieve by purchasing it.
* **Open-ended question:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I can get from John. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  There's still room for counteroffers and potential for a better deal.
* **Avoiding risk:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I might be able to get more from Bob.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue exploring that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a fantastic deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and justification:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still offering a deal significantly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  I'm also highlighting the benefit of this price for Bob.
* **Time pressure:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a quick close to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Continuing negotiation:** This counteroffer is still within my acceptable range, but it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm not willing to settle for less than what I can get from John, and I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Maintaining bargaining power:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him and allows me to continue trying to reach a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and we can close this right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** This is my final offer before considering John's offer. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is still more than what I can get from John. 
* **High-pressure tactics:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" and ""closing now"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leaving a slight gap:**  I'm still offering slightly higher than what I need, leaving room for Bob to counter if he's desperate for the product."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $980,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can agree on this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 6, and only 4 rounds remain. 
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $980,000 is still below the $1,000,000 I can get from John.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  There's a significant risk that Bob will continue to haggle, and I might not be able to secure a better price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, eliminating the uncertainty and risk of further negotiation with Bob."
