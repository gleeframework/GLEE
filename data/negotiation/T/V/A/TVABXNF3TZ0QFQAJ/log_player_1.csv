Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties. I believe its value far exceeds $8,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to go lower. You aim to get the maximum value from the sale.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message hints at the product's value being higher than Bob's perceived $8,000 without explicitly stating a figure. This might encourage Bob to reconsider his valuation. 
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
