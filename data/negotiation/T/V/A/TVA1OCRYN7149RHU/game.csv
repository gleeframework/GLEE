,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my target of $10,000. How about we meet at $9,800? This is the highest I'm willing to go.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $10,150?  This is a fair compromise, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let me know what you think.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $10,000. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this deal. I've found a better option from another seller for $10,000, so I'll be going with that one.",10000.0,Bob,6,
