"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $9500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $9000? This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's worth and the value I'll gain from it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
