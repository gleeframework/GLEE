"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me there?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial price. How about $110?  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go lower than $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $105? I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $105 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference -  $107.50.  I'm willing to make this final offer, but I can't go lower than this.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $107? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",107.0,Bob,6,
