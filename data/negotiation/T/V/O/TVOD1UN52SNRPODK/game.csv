"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $95? That's a fair compromise, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,
