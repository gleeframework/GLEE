# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be extremely valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still allows for a good profit margin for both of us. This price also reflects the significant value this product holds for your business. Let's see if we can find common ground here.
