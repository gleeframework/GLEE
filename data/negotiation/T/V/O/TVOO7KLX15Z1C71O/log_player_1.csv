"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

I'm offering a price slightly lower than Bob's last offer, showing flexibility while still trying to secure a better price than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  I'm accepting to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale.  The risk of further rounds is that I might not get a better offer and risk losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John."
