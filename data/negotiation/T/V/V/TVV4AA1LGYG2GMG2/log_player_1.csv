"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly below the midpoint between my minimum value and Bob's estimated value. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still offering a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
