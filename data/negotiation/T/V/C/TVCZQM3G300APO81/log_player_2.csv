"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You are willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $9,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice values the product at $8,000, offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's a compromise between your maximum price and her minimum price, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still lower than John's price of $10,000.  While it's not ideal, it's the best offer you've received so far.  Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price, but there's also a risk Alice will reject your offer again and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a calculated risk to accept the offer and secure the product at a slightly higher price than you hoped."
