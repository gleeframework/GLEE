Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While further negotiation is possible, Bob is running out of rounds and risks getting stuck with a price he's not comfortable with.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,000,000 and secure the product within his budget."
