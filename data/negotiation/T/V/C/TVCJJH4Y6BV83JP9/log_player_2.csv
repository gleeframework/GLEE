"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so she can't sell it for more than that to make a profit. Her offer of $115 is too high. I will reject it and buy the product from John for $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
