"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in this product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1000000?  I'm confident this product is valuable, and I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1100000.  Let's split the difference. How about $1050000?  That's a fair price that I'm confident we can both agree on.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
