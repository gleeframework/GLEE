# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

It's always best to try to negotiate, especially when you have an alternative. While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room to potentially save more.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to explore if Alice is willing to go lower."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

While Alice has come down to $1,100,000, there's still room for negotiation.  You're trying to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is a good deal for you. You're trying to save as much as possible, but continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product to another seller.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and save $420,000 compared to buying from John."
