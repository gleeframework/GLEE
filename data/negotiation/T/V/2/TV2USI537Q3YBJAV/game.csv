"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
