"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $11000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to $10500. How about we meet at $11200? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10800, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $10800 is a bit closer to my target, but I'm still not willing to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11500? It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $11500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. How about we meet at $11000, just like my previous offer?",11000.0,Bob,10,
