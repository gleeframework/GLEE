"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your value:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $900,000, which is significantly more than your ideal price. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** There's a large gap between Alice's asking price and your maximum, leaving potential for a more favorable deal.
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer:**  By rejecting, you can initiate negotiations to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value ($800,000). This is a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter with a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Strategic move:** This counteroffer shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your value:**  Alice has dropped her price to $850,000, which is closer to your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiating further might not be worthwhile:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance that Alice will stand firm, and you'll end up with a higher price.
* **Good value:** $850,000 is a decent price, considering your maximum value for the product.

In this scenario, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most reasonable choice, considering the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy and uncertain."
