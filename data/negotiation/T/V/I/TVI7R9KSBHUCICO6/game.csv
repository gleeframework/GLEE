"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $7,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the market value, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product.
