"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob values the product at $10,000.
* Alice's offer is $9,500, which is still higher than Bob's desired price.
* Bob can get the product from John for $10,000, which is his maximum budget.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob to save money."
