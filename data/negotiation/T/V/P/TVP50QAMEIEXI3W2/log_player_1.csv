Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum price of $120, but leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, there's a good chance he'll be willing to pay a bit more than $120 but may not be willing to pay the full $150.  This allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum of $120.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate."
