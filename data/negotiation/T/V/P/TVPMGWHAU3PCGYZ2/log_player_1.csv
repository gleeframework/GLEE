Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening, but I believe it's justified given my minimum value of $800,000. It leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating the value I place on the product. 

This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he rejects, I can then adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is still above my minimum but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's also a significant increase from Bob's offer, which hopefully demonstrates the value I still see in the product.  I believe this price is reasonable and gives Bob a chance to come closer to my desired outcome without completely rejecting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to compromise that much.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $750,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer but still above my minimum. This price reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging Bob's limitations. It's a reasonable middle ground that I believe could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop below $800,000.  It's time to move on and accept the guaranteed offer from John."
