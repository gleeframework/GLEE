Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to you, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
