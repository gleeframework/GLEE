"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and recognize the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which is a significant amount.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is still below your previous offer and closer to my budget. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
