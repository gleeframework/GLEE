"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low for me, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise for me. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,900. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,900. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he'll walk away.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000."
