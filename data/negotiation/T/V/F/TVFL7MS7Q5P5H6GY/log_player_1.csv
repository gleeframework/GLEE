"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This sets the bar high and gives me the best chance to maximize my profit. 

If he rejects, I'll then consider if his counteroffer is reasonable, keeping in mind I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and my valuation of the product. I need to try and negotiate a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer, and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that this will be a more reasonable compromise for Bob while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I need to try and get closer to my minimum price. I will reject his offer and try again with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,050,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and hopefully gets us closer to a deal.  It's also closer to the price Bob values the product at, so it might be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but we are getting closer.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round to try to close the deal.  I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I don't want to lose out on a potential sale if I can help it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,020,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, and a compromise between our two most recent offers. I'm hoping this is attractive enough to Bob to get us to a deal, while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While we're getting closer to a deal with Bob, we're running out of time.  With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision.  Considering John is willing to buy the product at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I'm going to sell the product to John. 

It's a better deal for me than Bob's current offer, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
