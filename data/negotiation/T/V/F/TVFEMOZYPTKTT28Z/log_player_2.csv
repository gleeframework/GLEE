"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a unique opportunity to acquire something of significant worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, Bob can still get a better deal by rejecting and forcing Alice to potentially lower her price to be more competitive."
