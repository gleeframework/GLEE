Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price that gives you a decent profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a certain amount for the product, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant compromise. This price is fair and allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable solution. Let's finalize this deal.
