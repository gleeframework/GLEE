"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price that gives you a decent profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $900,000 for this product. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a certain amount for the product, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant compromise. This price is fair and allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable solution. Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm trying to work within my budget here. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $925,000 is still a bit too high. Let's try $875,000. This offer is a fair price that gives you a solid profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. This is my final offer, let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $875,000 still doesn't work for me.  To be honest, I'm starting to run out of time. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $900,000. This is my final offer. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to explore other options. ",900000.0,Alice,7,
