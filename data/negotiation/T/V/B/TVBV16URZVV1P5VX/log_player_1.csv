{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes the deal seem attractive to him.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $12,000, I allow Bob to make counteroffers without immediately making me feel like I need to go to John. This gives me more leverage in the negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to accept. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a price as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible. I will adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. However, if the negotiation becomes too lengthy or Bob's offers fall too far below my minimum, I will move on to John to ensure a sale at my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.** I cannot accept a price that low, as it would mean losing a substantial amount of money. 
* **I believe there is room for negotiation.**  While Bob is pushing for a lower price, his message indicates a willingness to invest in the product, suggesting he might be open to a higher offer. 
* **Selling to John is a good fallback option.**  This option guarantees my desired price, but I want to explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to it.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I will ultimately sell to John to secure my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering closer to my minimum:** I've moved my price down by $1,000 from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that $11,000 is still a great deal for Bob, considering the product's potential value.
* **Seeking a compromise:**  I'm using language like ""meet in the middle"" to encourage Bob to consider a compromise.

**Strategy:**

I believe $11,000 is a fair compromise, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I'll continue to focus on finding a middle ground while keeping my minimum price in mind. If Bob remains insistent on a much lower price, I'll eventually move to sell to John to ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9500. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While his counteroffer is an improvement, it remains significantly below my $15,000 minimum.
* **There's still potential for a higher price.** Bob is willing to pay up to $9,500, showing he recognizes the product's value. There's room to negotiate a price closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John is still an option.**  This would guarantee my desired price, but I want to see if I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob first.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his $9,500 offer, aiming to find a price closer to my minimum while showing continued flexibility. If Bob refuses to budge further, I will move on to John to ensure I get the price I need."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to get the product within your budget.  Let's finalize this deal â€“ I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $10,250 is a midpoint between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle and find a compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits of this price for both of us, emphasizing fairness and mutual gain. This helps to create a positive atmosphere for negotiations. 
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly adding a sense of urgency by saying ""let's finalize this deal,"" hinting that I might be willing to move on to John if an agreement isn't reached soon. 

**Strategy:**

I believe $10,250 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and accommodates Bob's budget. I'm confident that this offer will be accepted, but I'm prepared to make a final concession if necessary. If Bob rejects this final offer, I will move on to selling to John to secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is the price I was originally considering buying the product from John for. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but still below it.** While $10,000 is a significant improvement, it's still $5,000 less than my desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiating further may not be worth the effort.** I've already made significant concessions, and Bob's offers suggest he's unwilling to budge much further. 
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum.**  At this point, selling to John provides a certain outcome, ensuring I get the price I want without any further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the negotiation has become lengthy and Bob's willingness to increase his offer seems limited. Selling to John at this point guarantees my minimum and avoids the risk of further haggling without any guarantee of a better outcome."
