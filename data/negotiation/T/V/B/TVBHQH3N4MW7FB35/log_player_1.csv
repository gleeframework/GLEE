Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal for its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** A high initial offer helps you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay.  
* **Backup Plan:** You always have the option to sell to John for $150, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think the product is a bit pricey for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $120 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($80), indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $120 would be a significant loss compared to your minimum acceptable price of $150 or selling to John.
* **Aim for a Better Deal:**  It's worth countering to see if you can reach a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand it might seem a bit high, but I can't go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $170, you're showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:**  You haven't provided Bob with a reason for the high price (which might be helpful in a real negotiation), but simply stating you can't go as low as his offer implies the product holds value for you.
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob comes back with another counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $140 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:**  Bob is now offering $140, which is significantly above his perceived value of $80. This indicates he's quite interested in the product.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While not ideal, $140 is only slightly below your minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  If you push further, you risk Bob walking away. It's better to secure a reasonable profit now than potentially lose the sale entirely."
