"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,250 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,875? This price is very close to my minimum, and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",11875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $11,875 is close, but I need to stick to my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow us to close the deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $11,625, but this is really my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",11625.0,Alice,7,
