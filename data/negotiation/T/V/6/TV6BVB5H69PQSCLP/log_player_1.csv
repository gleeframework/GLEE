"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though Bob might not perceive it at $2,200,000 yet.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer acknowledges that Bob will likely counter, and I'm prepared to negotiate strategically over the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a substantial increase from his perceived value, I have room to negotiate and aim higher. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your budgetary considerations, the value this product brings is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession from my initial offer ($2,200,000 to $1,800,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** Framing this offer as a compromise encourages Bob to reciprocate and move closer to my desired price range. 
* **Above Minimum, Targeting Value:**  The price of $1,800,000 is still well above my absolute minimum ($1,500,000) and targets a point where both parties could find value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still need to stay within my budget. Could you consider $1,600,000 as a fair price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000 and represents a significant profit. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Walk away:**  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but there's no guarantee he'll go much higher.
* **Stall:**  Prolonged negotiations could waste valuable time, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John. 

Accepting $1,600,000 at this point secures a strong profit and avoids the potential downsides of continued negotiation."
