**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though you value the product at $1,500,000, Alice is offering it for $1,200,000, which is a significant saving.
* **You still make a profit.** Buying the product for $1,200,000 and your value being $1,500,000 means you make a profit of $300,000."
