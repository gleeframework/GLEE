``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to secure a good deal. I'm also framing the offer as a great opportunity, which could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a lower price. Can we negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $100, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price of $120 by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm  reducing my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the value of the product."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to accept, while also allowing me to secure a decent price."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $106 is close to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. There are still several rounds remaining, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to accept, as we are getting very close to a deal."
