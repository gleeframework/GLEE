Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $610,000 is a tough ask for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $615,000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $615,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now very close to my counter offer. While I could try to push for $610,000, there's a risk she might not budge and I'd be left with the $800,000 option from John. Accepting the $615,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of missing out on the product."
