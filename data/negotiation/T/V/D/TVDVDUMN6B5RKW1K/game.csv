"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a great deal, considering the value it can bring to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10500. It's a bit above your maximum, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $10500 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000",9500.0,Bob,6,
