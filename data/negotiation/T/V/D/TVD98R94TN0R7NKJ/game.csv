"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a fair compromise. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, so I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. It's a bit above what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make a deal with you.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm committed to getting this product, but I can only go up to $10,000. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
