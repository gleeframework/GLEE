Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before buying from John."
