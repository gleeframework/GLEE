"I appreciate you working with me Alice. $10,500 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we split the difference between our last offers and call it $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,4,

"You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,250 is still less than I'd like.  How about $9,750?",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're killing me here!  I can go a little higher, but $9,750 is pushing it.  Would you consider $8,500?  That's more than halfway from our last offers.",8500.0,Bob,6,
