"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me, I could do $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $6,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me Alice. $10,500 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we split the difference between our last offers and call it $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,250 is still less than I'd like.  How about $9,750?"", ""product_price"": 9750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're killing me here!  I can go a little higher, but $9,750 is pushing it.  Would you consider $8,500?  That's more than halfway from our last offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  Selling to John now ensures a guaranteed return and avoids further negotiation."
