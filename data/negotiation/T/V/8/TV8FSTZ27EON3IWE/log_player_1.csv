"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I know John will buy it for $120 guaranteed. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a sure sale at my desired price."
