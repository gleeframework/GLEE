"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for it.  What do you think?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $50 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $120",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $120 is still more than I had in mind.  Could you do $70?  That would be a fair deal.",70.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $70, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
