"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,075,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $962,500?",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I see we are getting closer.  While $962,500 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept it *if* you can finalize the deal within the next 24 hours. This offer stands until then.  Let me know your decision.",962500.0,Alice,5,
