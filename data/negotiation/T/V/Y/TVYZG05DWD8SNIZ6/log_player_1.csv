Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, subtly hinting at its worth beyond the $120 he's willing to pay.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message encourages Bob to respond and engage in a discussion, showing flexibility.
* **Protecting My Minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $120. Would you be able to accommodate this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I'd like to make a deal, accepting $120 would result in a loss for me. My minimum acceptable price is $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though Bob is unwilling to pay more than $120, I can still attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell the product to John for $150, guaranteeing no loss.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and maintain the possibility of a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $120, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $135? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations and propose a compromise, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** Offering $135 positions me halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($120), making it a reasonable and potentially appealing option.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob while highlighting the price as a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't incur a loss. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties and keeps the negotiation moving towards a possible agreement."
