Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $12,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of getting a bargain. 

**Strategy:**

This offer is a calculated risk. There's a chance Bob might reject it, but I'm confident enough in my fallback option (selling to John for $15,000) to make this offer. The potential upside of selling to Bob at $12,000 is significant."
