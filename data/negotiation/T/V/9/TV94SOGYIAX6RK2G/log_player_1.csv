This offer is a starting point.  It allows for some negotiation while still ensuring I make a significant profit. I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $800,000 if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can negotiate a better price. How about $850,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum of $800,000. I'll counter his offer and see if we can come to an agreement."

I'm willing to drop a bit more, but I'm still holding firm on my desired profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and close the deal."

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm not quite ready to settle for that price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
