"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible profit, so starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) makes sense.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,400,000 offer leaves some space for negotiation while still securing a significant gain above our minimum.
* **Professional and Open Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting discussion, which is important for building rapport in a negotiation.

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counter-offer indicates he's willing to pay a premium over our minimum. Rejecting now gives us the opportunity to try and secure a better deal without risking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value. I've considered your perspective, and I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about we meet at $1,300,000? This reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're moving towards the middle ground by decreasing our asking price, but in smaller increments ($100,000) to signal we're not desperate to make a deal at any price. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise,"" reinforcing the idea that both parties are making concessions for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  $1,300,000 is still a substantial profit margin, and we're not dropping below this point until we gauge Bob's reaction further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This price takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** $1,250,000 is a significant profit, exceeding our minimum by $250,000.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's offer to ""meet halfway"" suggests he's committed to finding a compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's always the risk Bob could walk away.  The current offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
