"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me.  However, I'm looking to stay closer to my budget.  How about $10,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $11,500? This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it ensures I can stay within my spending limit.  Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. How about we try $11,250? This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
