"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its true worth.  While I'm confident I can secure a sale with another buyer for $1,000,000, I value a mutually beneficial agreement.  Consider this a gesture of good faith.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
