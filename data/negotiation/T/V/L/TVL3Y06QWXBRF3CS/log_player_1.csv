Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and allows me to get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to negotiate and makes the offer seem attractive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's still space for Bob to make a counteroffer that is within my acceptable range (closer to my minimum of $1,000,000).
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage to walk away if Bob gets too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to $1,150,000.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I have the leverage of John's offer at $1,000,000, so rejecting Bob's offer puts me in a stronger position to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point, and see if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offer. How about $1,125,000? This price would still be significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it gives me a fair return for my product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm using the ""meet you halfway"" tactic to show flexibility while still trying to get closer to my target price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this price is still significantly less than what the product is worth to him. This helps justify the counteroffer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for another round of negotiation, as $1,125,000 is still slightly higher than my minimum of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $1,087,500. This price is still a good compromise for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,087,500 is only $87,500 less than my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I might end up with John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Compromise:**  Accepting this offer is a good compromise, as it allows me to close the deal and secure a profit.

**It's important to weigh the potential gain against the potential loss. In this case, the potential loss of a better deal is outweighed by the certainty of selling the product for a price close to my minimum acceptable price.**"
