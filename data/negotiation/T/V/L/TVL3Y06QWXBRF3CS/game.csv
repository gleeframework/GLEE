"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and allows me to get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offer. How about $1,125,000? This price would still be significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it gives me a fair return for my product.  Let me know if you're interested.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $1,087,500. This price is still a good compromise for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. What do you think?",1087500.0,Bob,4,
