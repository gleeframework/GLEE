# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price around $145. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $145 is close to your limit, but there's room to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice!  While I do think the product is valuable, $145 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $135 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but $140 is still a bit high.  Let's see if we can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little hesitant at $140 though.  How about we split the difference and I pay $137.50?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we settle this right now at $139?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $139. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $139
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her original price, and we're very close to my limit. At $139, it's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product by continuing to negotiate."
