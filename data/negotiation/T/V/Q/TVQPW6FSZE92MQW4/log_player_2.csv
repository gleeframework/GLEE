Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 simply isn't a viable price for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.
