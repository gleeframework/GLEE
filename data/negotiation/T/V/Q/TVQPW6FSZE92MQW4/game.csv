"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000,  which is still a fair price considering the market value and the value this product brings to your business.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 simply isn't a viable price for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds for your business.  I believe we can close this deal if you're willing to come up just a bit.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
