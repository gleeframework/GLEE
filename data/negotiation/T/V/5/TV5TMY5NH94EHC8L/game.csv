"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I can meet you in the middle at $14000. This is my best offer for now. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $10000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
