Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.

Alice has come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $15,000.  It's worth accepting and saving $4,000."
