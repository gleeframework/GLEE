"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $1,150,000.  I believe that represents a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $1,225,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting very close to a deal that works for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, to $1,175,000.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that avoids dragging this out further.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
