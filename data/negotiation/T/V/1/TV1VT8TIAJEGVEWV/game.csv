"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I understand this is your best offer so far, but I'd be much more comfortable with a final price of $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,050,000. I can offer you a price of $1,012,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
