"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $1,475,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",1475000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,475,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is closer to my budget and still reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
