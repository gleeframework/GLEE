"Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I value this product at.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on that investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you value the product highly, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can get good value from the product at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I see you're serious about this product. How about we settle on $10,500? That's my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
