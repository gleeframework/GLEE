"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for a much lower price from John or by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I value this product at.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on that investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can still try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you value the product highly, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can get good value from the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I see you're serious about this product. How about we settle on $10,500? That's my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's budget, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation. While there are more rounds available, the risk is that Alice might not budge further. John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
