As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $800,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to make a generous offer of $600,000.

# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $450,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $450,000.
