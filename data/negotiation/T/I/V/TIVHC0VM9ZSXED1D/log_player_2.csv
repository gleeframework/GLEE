"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $800,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to make a generous offer of $600,000. This is a significant discount from the market value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $600,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. Considering the product's market value and the value it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $550,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while being more in line with your budget. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $480,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into this negotiation, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a new offer of $510,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while being closer to your target. What do you think?

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, $510,000 is a significant discount from both the market value and her initial offer. It's likely the best I'll get, and risking John's fixed price isn't worth the potential savings."
