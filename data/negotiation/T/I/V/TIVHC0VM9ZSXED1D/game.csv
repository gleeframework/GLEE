"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $800,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to make a generous offer of $600,000. This is a significant discount from the market value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $450,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects my budget.",450000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $600,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. Considering the product's market value and the value it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $550,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $550,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $500,000. Would you be willing to consider $480,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.",480000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $480,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into this negotiation, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a new offer of $510,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while being closer to your target. What do you think?",510000.0,Alice,5,
