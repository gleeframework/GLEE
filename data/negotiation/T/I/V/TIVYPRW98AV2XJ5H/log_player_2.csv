You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering the product for $14,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still better than John's offer. It's worth accepting the $14,000 price to avoid the extra $1,000 cost. While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the product to another buyer."
