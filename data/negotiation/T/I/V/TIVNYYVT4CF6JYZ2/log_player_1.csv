Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $120. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation and is less than the product's value to Bob ($150).
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  A starting price of $120 gives me a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  Leaving room for negotiation allows me to adjust my price if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Keep Bob interested:**  A friendly tone and highlighting the value of the product can keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($80), I'm still aiming to get a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can get a better price than $90.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105?  It's still a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm proposing $105. This is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob. This helps keep the negotiation amicable and focused on finding a solution. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Achieve a mutually acceptable price:**  The counteroffer is a compromise that offers Bob a better price than my initial offer while still giving me a higher price than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:**  This counteroffer signals my willingness to negotiate and encourages Bob to continue the process.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The message uses a friendly tone and emphasizes the benefits for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $97 is very close to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of rejection and needing to sell to John for $80 is too high. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent profit, and the negotiation process is complete."
