"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($80) while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105?  It's still a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's counteroffer again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

We're now negotiating within a smaller range and proposing a price closer to the middle ground between our previous offers.  This shows Alice we're serious about buying but still want a fair price."
