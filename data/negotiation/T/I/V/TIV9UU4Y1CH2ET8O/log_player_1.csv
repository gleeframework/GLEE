"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:**  I'm comfortable with this price, knowing I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is interested, there's room to come down a bit and find a price we both agree on. 
* **It signals value:** It shows Bob that I believe the product is valuable, and I'm not afraid to ask for a good price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$6,000 is far too low for me.  It's less than half of what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept. 

By sticking to my minimum, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price. It also leaves less room for further negotiation, which could help us close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. 

I believe there's still room for us to meet in the middle, especially since I'm willing to accept $12,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $10,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to an agreement and avoid having to go through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a price closer to my minimum. I believe there's still potential to get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and while $8,800 isn't terrible, I'm not confident I can get Bob to go any higher.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $12,000."
