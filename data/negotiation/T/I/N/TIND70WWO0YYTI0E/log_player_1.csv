"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Given my budget, I'm prepared to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

We're still a significant amount away from a reasonable offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be realistic about this.  The value of this product is substantial, and $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 975000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $975,000.  I'm really pushing the limits of my budget, but I'm willing to go to $950,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap and reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While not ideal, getting $950,000 is a reasonable outcome.  Continuing to push Bob risks him walking away, and it's unlikely we'll get much closer to $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds."
