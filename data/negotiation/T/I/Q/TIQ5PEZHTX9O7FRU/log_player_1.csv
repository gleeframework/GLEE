"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $105, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I can always sell to John for $120 if it comes to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference at $110? That feels fair to both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a counter-offer that's still higher than Bob's offer, but a bit lower than my initial price. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, while also remaining confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a little hesitant at $110.  How about $107?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $107 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, I believe I can still do better. I have a few more rounds to try and get a higher price from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $107 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finally move forward."", ""product_price"": 109} 
```

I'm offering a counter-offer at $109, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his price point. This shows I am willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell for anything less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway at $108. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum, and I only have a few rounds left before I can sell to John."
