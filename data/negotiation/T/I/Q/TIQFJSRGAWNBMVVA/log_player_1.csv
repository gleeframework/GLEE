Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I was thinking of a price of $700,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better deal."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget with the new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $775,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to move on to John who is offering my minimum acceptable price."
