"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's too early to tell if the product is worth more than $5,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 2500} 
```

I'm starting low to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $2500 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and it gives us room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. By rejecting her offer, I can continue to try and drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  $3,000 is still a good deal for me, and I believe Alice might be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While I could potentially try to squeeze out another $500, the risk of her walking away is too high. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoid the risk of having to buy from John."
