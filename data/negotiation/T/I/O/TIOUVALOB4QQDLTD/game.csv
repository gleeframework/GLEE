"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique product like this, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8200, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's unique value. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get a great deal on this product, and I'm hoping you can understand my position. Can you meet me at $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get a great deal on this product, and I appreciate your willingness to take a risk. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I can do $7600, which is still a discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",7600.0,Alice,5,
