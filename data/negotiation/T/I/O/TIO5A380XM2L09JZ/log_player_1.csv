Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging to keep Bob engaged.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer at $15,000 allows me to be more assertive. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $9,500 is better than his initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  I believe I can get a better offer from Bob. His counteroffer demonstrates his interest, and I can leverage my backup buyer (John) to negotiate further.
* **Building Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage and positions me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer in the Middle:** I'm offering a counter-offer of $11,000, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still being closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone and encourages further negotiation.
* **Leveraging John:** The implied threat of selling to John is still there, but I'm not explicitly mentioning him. The counter-offer itself is enough to show I'm not desperate for a sale. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while trying to push Bob towards a price that is more favorable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000 than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome.
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  At this point, there's limited room for further negotiation.  Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to his initial valuation, suggesting he may not be willing to go much higher. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is above my minimum.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation potentially ending in a lower sale price is not worth taking.

Therefore, it's in my best interest to secure the guaranteed profit and sell to John."
