"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This low offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $14,000 is still significantly higher than my target price and my maximum budget. 
* **Alice is Negotiating:** Alice reducing her price suggests she's open to negotiation, so there's room to go lower.
* **John as Backup:** I'll continue negotiating, but I'm keeping the option of buying from John for $10,000 in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer, my budget for this product is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Presenting My Maximum:** I'm now revealing my maximum price to Alice. This lets her know I'm serious but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Seeking a Quick Resolution:**  I'm hoping Alice will see that $10,000 is a fair compromise and we can avoid further back and forth.
* **John Still an Option:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely take John's deal to avoid potentially wasting more time and risk not reaching a deal at all."
