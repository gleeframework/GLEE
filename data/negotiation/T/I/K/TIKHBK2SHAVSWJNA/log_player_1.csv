I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his perceived value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum price, but it demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price point for Bob, while still leaving me with a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer. I'm hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a smaller concession than before, showing that I'm getting closer to my minimum price. It's a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob before I sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer and I'm not willing to risk a further drop in price."
