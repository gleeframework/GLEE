"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, making rejecting Alice's offer the best choice."
