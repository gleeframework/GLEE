"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $12,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $9,000, which is a 25% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than my desired price. I'm going to reject her offer and continue negotiating. I'm not willing to pay $11,000 yet, but I'm also not ready to buy from John for $12,000. I still believe I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal.  It's also a middle ground between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.  Hopefully, this will entice her to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my target price, and we are at the halfway point of the negotiations.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at $12,000. Accepting this offer gives me a $1,500 saving compared to John. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm happy with this outcome."
