,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me right now.  How about $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $105? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $108. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $108 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $106.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider my other options.",106.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $109. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",109.0,Alice,7,
