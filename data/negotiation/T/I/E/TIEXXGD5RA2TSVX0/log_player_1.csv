Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This shows Bob you value the product and aren't giving it away. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's perceived value is $1,000,000, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Starting too high could make Bob immediately walk away. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take it, it's better to hold out for a better price.  Selling to John would net me a higher amount. However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is a compromise: it's higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his latest offer is still below what I'm willing to accept.  It's not worth risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It's time to move on and secure a sale with John."
