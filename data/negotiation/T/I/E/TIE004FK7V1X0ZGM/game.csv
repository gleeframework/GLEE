"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to consider $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great opportunity for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10800 and $9500, so I'll offer $10150. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you halfway this time, Bob. I think $10800 is a fair price for this product, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $10750. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer, $10500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry to hear that $10500 is still too high for you, Bob. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think we've reached a stalemate. I'm going to have to consider selling the product to John for $10000, as I've already agreed to do so. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I think it's time for me to move on.",10000.0,Alice,9,
