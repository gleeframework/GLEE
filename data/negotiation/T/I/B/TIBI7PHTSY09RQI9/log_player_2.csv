"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  There are still rounds available to potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little below what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $95 is closer to his target, he can likely squeeze a few more dollars off with further negotiation.  There are still several rounds left to try for a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $95 is still a bit high for me. How about $92? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price."", ""product_price"": 92}
