"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $100 is not ideal. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down in price, $95 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay. He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not quite there. $95 is closer but I'm only able to offer $90.  It's a good price for both of us. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
