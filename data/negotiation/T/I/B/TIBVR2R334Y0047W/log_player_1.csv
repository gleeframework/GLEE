Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price above Bob's value but below my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation without risking a quick rejection.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's also closer to my desired price than his initial valuation. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering a price that is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still trying to secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there. $95 is closer but I'm only able to offer $90.  It's a good price for both of us. Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below my initial desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. With each round, the negotiation becomes more time-consuming, and the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and at a reasonable price. Additionally, selling to John would yield only $30 more, which isn't a significant enough difference to justify the risk of losing Bob completely."
