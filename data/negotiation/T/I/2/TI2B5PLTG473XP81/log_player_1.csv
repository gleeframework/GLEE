"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss selling you this product. I believe it's very valuable and could benefit you greatly.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $11,000."", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit. 
* **Polite and Professional:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good profit, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. His message suggests he's willing to pay a premium, indicating there might be room for a compromise between his offer and my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget considerations, Bob. How about we meet halfway at $10,250?  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 10250} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counter-offer splits the difference between my initial offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm keeping the tone collaborative and solution-oriented to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and willing to meet halfway. While I was aiming for a higher price, accepting his offer of $9,800 makes sense at this point:

* **Strong Profit:**  This price still represents a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob withdrawing his interest. Accepting now secures the deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later has its own value, allowing me to move on to other opportunities."
