"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $800,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a good start, but I'm looking to pay closer to $600,000. I believe there's room to find a price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer was $800,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a compromise, it's still higher than Bob's target price. There's still room for negotiation to try and get closer to $600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate further. There's still a significant gap between $850,000 and his ideal $600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  I think this is a fair compromise given our previous offers. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his ideal price, it's a good deal considering:

* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** There are only 3 rounds left, and the risk of losing the product to John or continuing to negotiate with Alice and getting a worse deal is high.
* **Potential Loss:**  If Bob rejects and continues to negotiate, he risks Alice getting tired of the negotiation and walking away, leaving him with no option but to buy from John at a much higher price.

Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's more favorable than John's and within a reasonable range of his initial goal."
