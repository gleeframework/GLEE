"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'd be happy to buy the product for $900,000. This price still represents a significant value for me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $925,000 is a good compromise. It's only $25,000 more than my counteroffer, and it saves me $75,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it."
