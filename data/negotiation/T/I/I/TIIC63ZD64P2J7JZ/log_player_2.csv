You can do better than $1,400,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a price that's closer to Alice's value of $1,200,000 but still gives me some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Alice's offer is now $1,350,000, which is still within my budget and closer to my desired price. I'll accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the product to someone else."
