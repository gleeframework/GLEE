"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying and what his budget might be. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of how to approach the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, it's a price that Bob will consider while still being closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,250,000 is still not acceptable to me. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to see a more significant increase in his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. If Bob rejects this, I might be willing to accept John's offer in the next round, as the negotiations seem to be stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the offer. I think there's room for Bob to increase his offer further. I'm going to reject and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be ready to sell to John."
