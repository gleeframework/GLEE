"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to negotiate a fair price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal without resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's risky.  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate but also has a firm bottom line.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, without the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the potential of John raising his price."
