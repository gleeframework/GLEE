You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away unless the price is more favorable."
