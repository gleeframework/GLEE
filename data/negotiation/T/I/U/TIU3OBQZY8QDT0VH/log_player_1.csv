I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's perceived value but still leaves me a good profit margin.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this deal and accept the offer. If he doesn't, I can still negotiate with him or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for less than $12,500, but I'm also not sure if I can get a better price from him.  I'll reject his offer for now and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my previous offer and his current one.  It's still a good price for me, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept the deal."

Bob is not budging from his offer. I've already offered him a compromise, and he still refuses. It seems like we've reached an impasse, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.  Instead of risking further delays and potential deadlock, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $12,000. While I would prefer to sell it for a higher price, this is still a reasonable profit margin for me."
