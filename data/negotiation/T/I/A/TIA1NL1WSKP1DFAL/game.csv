"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I'm really interested in making this purchase, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm very eager to purchase this product from you.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $8950, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",8950.0,Alice,5,
