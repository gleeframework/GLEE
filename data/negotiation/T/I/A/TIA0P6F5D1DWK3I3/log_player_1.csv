Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, I create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, I make a significant profit. If he rejects it, I can proceed with John knowing I secured the best possible outcome."
