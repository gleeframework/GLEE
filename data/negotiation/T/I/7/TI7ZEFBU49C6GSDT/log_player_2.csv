"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. There are still 9 rounds left, so you have plenty of time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $7,500, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential concessions in future rounds while still staying below my $8,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,200 is now within my budget and represents a decent saving compared to John's offer of $8,000. It's reasonable to accept this offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation, as there's a risk of not reaching an agreement and potentially being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
