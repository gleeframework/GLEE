Round 2

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $95? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. This is the lowest I can go, as it's already below my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $100 is still too high for Bob, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation.  It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go lower.  Bob should buy the product from John for $80, as it's the best deal available to him."
