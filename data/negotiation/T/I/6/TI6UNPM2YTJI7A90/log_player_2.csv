"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good deal, it's still above your target of $120. There's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $110 is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal for a product you'll value at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above your target of $120, but it's getting closer.  You've already rejected her previous offer and countered with $105.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult.  Buying from Alice at $110 is a better option than paying John $120, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation breakdown."
