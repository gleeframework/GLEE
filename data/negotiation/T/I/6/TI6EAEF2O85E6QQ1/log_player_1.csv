Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe will be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or at least get closer to my goal of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  That's a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. Bob keeps offering lower prices, and I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Considering my minimum price is $15,000, and I'm at round 6, it's time to cut my losses.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to avoid risking a further decrease in price."
