"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd like to offer you $1,050,000 for it. This aligns with the value I'm placing on the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than her original offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject again, leading to a higher price from John.  At $1,100,000, Bob saves $100,000 compared to John's offer, making it a worthwhile deal."
