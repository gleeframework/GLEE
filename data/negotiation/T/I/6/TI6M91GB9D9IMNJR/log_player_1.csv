Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your initial asking price, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counteroffer $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $8,750 is a good compromise. It's more than what John is offering, and it's within a reasonable range of Bob's initial valuation. I'm accepting his offer."
