"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $11,500? That's the best I can do.",11500.0,Bob,6,
