"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $14,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I still think $9,500 is below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $10,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm committed to paying $9,800.  This is my final offer, I can't go any higher.  Let's close the deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're committed to your offer, but I'm not willing to accept $9,800. I'll make one more counteroffer, $10,200, which is my final concession. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,7,
