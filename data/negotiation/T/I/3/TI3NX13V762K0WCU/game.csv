"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we discuss a price closer to $950,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise considering both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This allows me to get closer to my desired value, while still leaving you with a significant gain.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
