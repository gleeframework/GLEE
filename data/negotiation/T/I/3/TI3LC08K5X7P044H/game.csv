"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,350,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but no more than that. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close but $1,250,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  let's go with $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
