Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, given my understanding of its market value and my own financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, the value of this product significantly exceeds $850,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,100,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good starting point for further negotiation. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution if we keep working together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly below John's offer of $1,000,000. It's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer to a point that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile, especially given we only have a limited number of rounds. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the most logical choice at this point."
