"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, given my understanding of its market value and my own financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, the value of this product significantly exceeds $850,000.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,100,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good starting point for further negotiation. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution if we keep working together.",950000.0,Bob,4,
