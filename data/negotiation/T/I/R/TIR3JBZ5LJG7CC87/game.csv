"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
