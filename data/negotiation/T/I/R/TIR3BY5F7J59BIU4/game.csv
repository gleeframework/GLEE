"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in your product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $1200000. Would you be open to discussing that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1350000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go to $1250000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $1275000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'd like to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50000. So, the total price would be $1350000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate the additional value you're offering, but I'm still struggling with the price.  I'm willing to pay $1275000 for the product, and would be happy to pay separately for the service at a fair rate. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're still not comfortable with the price, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $1300000, but I'll also throw in the complimentary service as before. This is my absolute final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
