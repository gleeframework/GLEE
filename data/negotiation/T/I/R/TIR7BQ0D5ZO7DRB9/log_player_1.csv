Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and be prepared to negotiate down if necessary.  If he seems truly uninterested, I'll switch to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to accept a loss of $300,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still holding out for a good profit.  $1,750,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer more, selling to Bob for $1,400,000 is a good deal.  It's better than selling to John and it means I don't have to risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate."
