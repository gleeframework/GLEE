"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something that I know will be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum price, but it's still within a reasonable range. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to still get a reasonable price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,350,000, which is within my budget and still a good deal for me.  It's closer to my preferred price, and there's a good chance we can reach a final agreement in the next few rounds. Buying from John would be more expensive, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point."
