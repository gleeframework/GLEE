"Alice, your product looks great, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to still get a reasonable price for my product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
