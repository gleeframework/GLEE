"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum price, it's always worth trying to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and sets the stage for a back-and-forth. I'm confident I can still get a good deal, but leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to pay $115, but I'll try to squeeze out a few more dollars. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product.  $110 is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's within Alice's range of acceptable prices.  If she rejects this, we're getting close to my maximum, and I might consider accepting her next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112.5, which is very close to my target price. Continuing to negotiate could potentially save me a few more dollars, but the risk of not reaching a deal and having to buy from John at $120 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a good price while minimizing the risk."
