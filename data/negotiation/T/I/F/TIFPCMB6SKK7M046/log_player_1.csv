"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Using phrases like ""proposing an initial price"" and ""starting point for discussions"" signals to Bob that I'm open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Secure the highest possible price from Bob.
2. **Gather Information:** Understand Bob's willingness to pay and negotiation style.
3. **Maintain Flexibility:** I can always lower my price in subsequent rounds or choose to sell to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the initial price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This indicates room for further negotiation. 

Here's why I'm choosing to reject and counter:

* **Potential for More:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate and his initial counteroffer suggest he might be willing to go higher. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have the safety net of selling to John for my minimum price. This gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob. 

I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  I'm open to exploring options within this range to find a solution that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've come down from my initial price by $200,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, my counteroffer is still significantly higher than his, keeping the pressure on him to move closer to my desired price. 
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Open to Compromise:** The language suggests flexibility (""exploring options within this range"") while still anchoring my target price.

By taking this approach, I aim to:

* **Maintain Momentum:** Keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Test Bob's Limit:** See how far he's willing to go.
* **Leave Room:**  Allow for potential concessions in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $2,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,050,000 is a strong deal for several reasons:

* **Significant Profit:** It's well above my minimum price of $1,500,000 and represents a substantial profit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has moved closer to my price range. This offer suggests a genuine attempt at compromise.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome.

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward. This offer provides a strong balance of profit and deal security."
