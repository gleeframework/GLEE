"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This takes into consideration your interest and still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for it. Can you consider that?",10900.0,Bob,4,
