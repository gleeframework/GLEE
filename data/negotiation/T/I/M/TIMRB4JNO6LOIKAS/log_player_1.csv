Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for Counteroffers:** This price gives Bob some room to negotiate without immediately making the offer unattractive.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the potential value to Bob, which can help him see the offer as a good deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The possibility of selling to John for $10,000 provides a baseline for my negotiations and helps me avoid accepting offers that are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While Bob's offer is still above John's offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob is clearly interested in the product.
* **Exploring a higher counteroffer:** By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This takes into consideration your interest and still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price by $300 from my initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Justification for the price:** I'm providing a reason for the price by mentioning both Bob's interest and my desire for a fair profit.
* **Maintaining a good price:**  $11,200 is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum threshold and leaves room for potential future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,900 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject his offer and counteroffer again, he might walk away entirely. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I can still sell to John for $10,000 if the deal with Bob falls through.

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale that is almost as good as my minimum and avoid risking a complete breakdown in negotiations."
