Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm looking to make a more substantial discount. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation so far. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no point in further negotiation with Bob as it risks a lower final price. Accepting John's offer ensures we get the maximum guaranteed value for the product."
