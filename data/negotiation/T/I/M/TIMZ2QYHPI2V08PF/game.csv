"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering your price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
