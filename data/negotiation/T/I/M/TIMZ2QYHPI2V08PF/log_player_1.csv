"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open Communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, encouraging a dialogue. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to establish a baseline and set the tone for the negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a higher price while also leaving room for compromise. I will monitor Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, keeping in mind the $1,000,000 backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering your price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial $800,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I need to maintain my bargaining position and aim for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counter-offer in the next round. 
* **Target Price:** I'll try to bring Bob closer to my target price of $1,000,000, while also considering the potential deal with John.
* **Flexible, but Firm:** I'll remain flexible in my negotiation, but I won't compromise on a price that's significantly below my minimum threshold. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully consider how to counter Bob's offer in a way that encourages a deal while still ensuring I get a price I'm comfortable with. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain High Ground:** I'm not dropping too much from my initial price, signaling that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  The new price is a $100,000 reduction from my first offer, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone, focusing on finding common ground and emphasizing the value Bob will receive. 

**Strategy:**

* **Test the Waters:** This offer gauges Bob's willingness to negotiate further.
* **Gradual Approach:**  By lowering the price in smaller increments, I'm aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price point.
* **Balance:** I'm keeping in mind my minimum target price while also acknowledging the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to consider $1,000,000 as the maximum I can pay for your product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price Met:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Money:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's crucial to avoid potential delays in further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John guarantees the same amount, accepting Bob's offer now allows me to finalize the deal and potentially move on to other opportunities. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures my desired minimum price and allows me to close the deal quickly. It's a win-win situation, as I achieve my target while avoiding further negotiation and potential delays."
