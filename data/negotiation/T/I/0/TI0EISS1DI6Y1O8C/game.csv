"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,250,000?  I'm very interested in this product but need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $1,300,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Would you consider $1,275,000?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can meet you halfway between $1,275,000 and $1,300,000, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,287,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
