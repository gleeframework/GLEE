"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to come in a bit lower.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your need to make a profit. ",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a significant profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
