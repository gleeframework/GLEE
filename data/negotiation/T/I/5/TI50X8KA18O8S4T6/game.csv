"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $11,000?  It's a fair price considering both of our desired values. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
