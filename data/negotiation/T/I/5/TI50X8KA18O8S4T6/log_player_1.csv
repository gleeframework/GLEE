{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's lower than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if needed.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll also be watching for signs that he's not serious, so I can move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $11,000?  It's a fair price considering both of our desired values. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's close enough and it's clear Bob is not willing to go higher.  It's better to secure a sale at $11,000 than risk losing the sale entirely and having to go with John at $15,000."
