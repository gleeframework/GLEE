Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's truly a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to generate significant returns for your company.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a healthy margin for both of us.  Let's talk further about this and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more substantial profit on this deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this price is more reasonable and beneficial for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm willing to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is unfortunately not a price that works for me.  The product's value is higher than that, and I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both sides."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable and still allows for a good profit for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting. There's still room for negotiation and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $890,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to make a profit.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this price is fair and allows for a reasonable profit for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000.  While it's still less than my minimum desired price of $800,000, it's a good deal considering I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's likely that further negotiation will result in only minor price adjustments, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a profitable sale."
