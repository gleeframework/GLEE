"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's truly a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to generate significant returns for your company.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a healthy margin for both of us.  Let's talk further about this and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more substantial profit on this deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this price is more reasonable and beneficial for both parties.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is unfortunately not a price that works for me.  The product's value is higher than that, and I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both sides.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable and still allows for a good profit for both parties.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $890,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to make a profit.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",890000.0,Alice,5,
