,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9000 to $8000, so how about $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8500 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $8750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8200 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $8350. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let's call it a day and move forward with the transaction.",8350.0,Alice,9,
