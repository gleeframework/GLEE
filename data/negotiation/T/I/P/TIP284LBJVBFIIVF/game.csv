"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given that it's worth $8,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
