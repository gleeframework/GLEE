Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value of $10,000, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $9,500 is a good starting point that allows for some back and forth without going below my minimum of $8,000. 
* **Positive tone:**  Keeping the message positive and friendly can help build rapport and increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $8,500 is close, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He's clearly interested in the product and his offer indicates he's willing to pay more than John's $8,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that $9,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  My message is still friendly and encouraging, hoping to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to make a new offer of $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous prices. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is just $250 below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though it's not ideal, accepting this offer allows me to avoid further negotiation. It also opens the door for potentially better deals with Bob in the future, as he's demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer and make another counteroffer, there's a chance Bob will walk away entirely.  It's better to secure a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether."
