"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's maximum value for the product is $15,000, Alice's offer of $14,000 is still lower than that.  This means Bob gets a better deal than buying from John.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000."
