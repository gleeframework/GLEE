Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your valuation and John's offer), you have leverage to start high.
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer significantly exceeds both your and Bob's valuations. While it might seem steep, it allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. You can gradually lower the price, always keeping your $1,500,000 safety net in mind.

By starting high and being prepared to negotiate, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
