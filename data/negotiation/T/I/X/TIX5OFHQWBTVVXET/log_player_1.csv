{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you still make a profit.
* **It's reasonable:** It's not an overly aggressive opening price, which could make Bob walk away. 

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,350,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a bit longer, hoping we can reach a mutually acceptable price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $1,300,000 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise one last time. Let's split the difference and go with $1,325,000. This is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear that Bob and I are not going to come to an agreement. He's unwilling to go above $1,275,000, and I'm not willing to go below $1,325,000.  Since John is offering my minimum price, I'll sell the product to him."
