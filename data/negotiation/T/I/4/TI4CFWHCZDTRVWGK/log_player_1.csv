"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob rejects this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to negotiate further.  While John is a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, I believe I can potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm going to keep negotiating with him, hoping we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  However, I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price again, to $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him, and that we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,450,000. This is a small drop from Bob's last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping that this will be enough to persuade Bob to accept my offer."
