"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $110? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can meet in the middle.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the sale if you agree.",115.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to walking away, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $112. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll make the purchase.",112.0,Bob,6,
