{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also incentivizes him to accept the offer to avoid potentially losing the product.  It's also a good starting point to see how Bob reacts and what counter-offers he might make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to get closer to my goal by sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price of $120, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows some flexibility and willingness to compromise, but it's still significantly above Bob's offer, ensuring I don't lose too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $110? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the sale if you agree."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm proposing $115, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also emphasizing the potential for a quick sale to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $112. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is clearly unwilling to go much higher.  $112 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with him.  It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John and move on."
