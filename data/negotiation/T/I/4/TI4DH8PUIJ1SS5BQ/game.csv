"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $140 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  How about $125? I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen! ",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $130.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",130.0,Bob,4,
