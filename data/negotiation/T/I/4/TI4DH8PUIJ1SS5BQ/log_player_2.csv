"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than what he'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $140 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  How about $125? I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $135 is better than John's price, there's still room to negotiate closer to his target price. It's worth trying to push Alice down a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $130.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 130}
