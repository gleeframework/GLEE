"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  It's something that's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm confident you'll find it to be an excellent investment.  Let's talk about a price of $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John is asking for $1,000,000. 
* **You can save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **It's a win-win:**  While Alice is getting a better price than her minimum, you are still getting the product for less than what you value it at."
