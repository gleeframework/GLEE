"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95. I want to save as much money as possible, so I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value of $80.  This gives us both some room to negotiate and hopefully leads to a quick deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Alice's initial offer, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. Let's try $87.50. That's closer to my target and still leaves some room for you to profit."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $85 and Alice's latest offer of $90. This shows I'm serious about making a deal but still trying to get a better price."
