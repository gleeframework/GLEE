# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?

$20,000 is way too high.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000. That's a fair price for both of us, as it's still much higher than what the product is worth to me. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers a unique set of benefits, and I'm confident it can generate much more value for you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $15,000 for this to make sense for me. Let's split the difference again - would you consider $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to hold out for a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to a deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is being stubborn.  It seems like we're getting close to a deal, but we're down to the wire, and it's time to take the safer option.  I'll buy from John for $8,000."
