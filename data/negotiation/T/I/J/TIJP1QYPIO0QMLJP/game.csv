"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the value this product brings.  To be frank, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This recognizes the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant opportunity.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've given this offer careful consideration, and I need to be upfront about my position. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,050,000. This is a firm price, as I already have other compelling offers on the table. I believe this represents a fair deal, considering the true value and potential of this product.  Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the negotiations so far and the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",925000.0,Bob,6,
