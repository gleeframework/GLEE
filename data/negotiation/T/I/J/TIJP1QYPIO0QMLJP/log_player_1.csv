"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as justified due to the product's ""immense value and potential."" This helps avoid alienating Bob early on.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording ""starting point for discussions"" clearly signals that I'm willing to negotiate. 
 
**Strategy:** My goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to be mindful of Bob's potential counteroffers and the $1,000,000 backup offer from John. I'll adjust my approach based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000, indicating he's willing to stretch a bit. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Below My Minimum:** Accepting $900,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to gradually bring Bob closer to my desired range without losing him to a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the value this product brings.  To be frank, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This recognizes the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant price drop from $1,300,000 to $1,100,000. This signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above My Minimum:** This price point still ensures a substantial profit and is above John's offer.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":** Framing this as a compromise helps maintain a positive tone and encourages Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, reinforcing why my price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's negotiating but in small increments.  At this rate, reaching an agreeable price that's significantly above John's offer might take too many rounds.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of John's guaranteed offer becomes more appealing, especially as Bob's concessions are relatively minor.

**Strategy:** I'll make one final counteroffer, close to John's offer. This will signal the end of my flexibility and encourage Bob to make a substantial move if he's truly interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've given this offer careful consideration, and I need to be upfront about my position. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,050,000. This is a firm price, as I already have other compelling offers on the table. I believe this represents a fair deal, considering the true value and potential of this product.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** The message clearly states that this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Premium to John:** Offering $1,050,000 is still a slight improvement over John's $1,000,000 and leaves a small margin for profit.
* **Justified Price:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob why this final offer is reasonable.
* **Decision Point:** This counteroffer forces Bob to make a significant decision:  meet my price, walk away, or engage in a final round of serious negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the negotiations so far and the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:**  Even after my ""final offer,"" Bob has only increased his offer slightly. It's clear he's highly unlikely to reach my desired price point.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's guaranteed offer, which is already better than Bob's current proposal.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome at this point in the negotiation.

**Conclusion:** While there's a slim chance Bob might dramatically increase his offer in the next round, it's not worth the risk. Accepting John's offer ensures a significant profit and avoids a potential stalemate with Bob."
