"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  We don't want to insult Alice with an extremely low offer, but we need to start pushing the price down. $10,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Alice to continue the negotiation rather than walking away. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:** This common tactic suggests fairness and compromise, potentially making Alice more receptive to our counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down slowly.  While $11,500 is closer to our goal, we still have room to negotiate. We'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of reaching a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $9,500? I'm ready to close the deal if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** We're continuing to reduce our offer in smaller increments, signaling we're serious about buying but also holding our ground on price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating we're ""ready to close the deal,"" we introduce a subtle sense of urgency, which might encourage Alice to make a concession.
* **Targeting below $10k:**  We're aiming to get Alice to cross the psychological threshold of $10,000, which could make a deal in the $9,000 range seem more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,500, which would be $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we're still slightly above our $8,000 target, Alice has signaled that $10,500 is her bottom line.  Continuing to negotiate might make her walk away, forcing us to buy from John at $8,000. Accepting this offer saves us $2,000 compared to her initial price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
