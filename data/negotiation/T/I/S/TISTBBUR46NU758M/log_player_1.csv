Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  It's a bit higher than Bob's value, but I want to see if I can get him to budge. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. It's a compromise -  closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer of $98 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is more than worth the effort of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
