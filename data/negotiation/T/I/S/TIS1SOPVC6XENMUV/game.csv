,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still leaving room for you to profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, considering your interest in the product. This price still offers you a good value, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can finalize this negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1000000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1100000. This price reflects the value to both of us, and it allows for a successful transaction. Let's finalize this deal!",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1050000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
