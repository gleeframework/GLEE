"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going right now.  I'm willing to meet you at $975000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",975000.0,Bob,4,
