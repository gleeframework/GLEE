"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering the return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $22,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's best to reject and start negotiating.  There are 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
