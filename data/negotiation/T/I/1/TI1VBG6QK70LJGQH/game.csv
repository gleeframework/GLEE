"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering the return on investment you'll see.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is my final offer.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $19,000. While I value this product, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to accept $16,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for continuing to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer,  $16,500 is still more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I truly believe this product has great value for me, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
