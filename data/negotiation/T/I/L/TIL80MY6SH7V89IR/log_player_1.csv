"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but given my financial situation, I'm unable to go beyond $1,200,000 for this product. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but we're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, as there's still room to go up before I have to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm lowering my price significantly in this round to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to move closer to my acceptable range.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly increased his offer and is now at $1,400,000. While this is still below my ideal price, it's getting close enough that the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing both offers outweighs the potential reward of a slightly higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for me."
