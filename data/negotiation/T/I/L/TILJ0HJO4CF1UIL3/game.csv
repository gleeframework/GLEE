"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is well above what I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $20000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",20000.0,Alice,3,
