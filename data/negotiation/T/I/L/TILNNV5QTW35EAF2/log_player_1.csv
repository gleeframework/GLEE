"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. I will reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  $600,000 is not even close to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a substantial amount and shows how serious I am about this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $900,000 is closer but still a bit too low. Let's try $1,000,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be perfectly honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $800,000 is close to my minimum, it's still not a satisfactory price for me.  I've been through several rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Bob is not willing to come up to my desired price point.  I don't want to risk continuing the negotiation and potentially losing even more money.  It's better to sell to John and ensure a better outcome."
