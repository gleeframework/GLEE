Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the product's value.  Let me know what you think.
