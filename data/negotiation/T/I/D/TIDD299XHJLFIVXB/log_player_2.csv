"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since you're looking for a price under $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is exactly your limit, there's no benefit to negotiating with her.  Buying from John at the same price is the most efficient solution."
