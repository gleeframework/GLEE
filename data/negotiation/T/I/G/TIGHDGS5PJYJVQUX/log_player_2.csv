"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's a unique item that has a lot of potential value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for the exact same price as John. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice. There's no benefit to rejecting and going with John, as the price is the same."
