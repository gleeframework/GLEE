Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I want to start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $18,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses language that implies value and encourages Bob to seriously consider the offer.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging I have a fallback option with John."
