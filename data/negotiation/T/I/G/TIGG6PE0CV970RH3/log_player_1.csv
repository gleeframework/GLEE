Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives Bob room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident that I can get at least $800,000 from John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is still a significant profit for me and very close to what I'd get from John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
