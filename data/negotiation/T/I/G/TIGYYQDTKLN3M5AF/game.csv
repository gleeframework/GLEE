"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay that price for a product in excellent condition like yours. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $7,500, so how about $8,000? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",8000.0,Bob,4,
