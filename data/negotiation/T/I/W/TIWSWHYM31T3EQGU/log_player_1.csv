Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at a price that's more in my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's a fair compromise that still gives me some wiggle room. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at a price that's more in my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting dangerously close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher.  To be safe, I'm going to take John's offer of $12,000. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale altogether."
