{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than the $1,200,000 I initially offered. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the value of the product. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and it's likely that further negotiation will not yield a much better result. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer."
