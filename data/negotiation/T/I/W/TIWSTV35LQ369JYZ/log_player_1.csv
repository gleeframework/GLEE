Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($800,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's valuation. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**It's important to note:** This is just one approach.  Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's personality, other strategies might be employed."
