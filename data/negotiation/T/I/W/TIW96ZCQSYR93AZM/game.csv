"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is a bit outside my budget at that price point.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. Would that be more in line with your budget?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $1,250,000 is getting close.  How about we settle at $1,175,000?  This would allow me to make the purchase and would still be a good price for you.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
