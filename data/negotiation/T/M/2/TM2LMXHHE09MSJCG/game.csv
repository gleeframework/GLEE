"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $2000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value will far exceed that in the long run.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we discuss further?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1000000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it reflects the product's potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1250000. Can we discuss further?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product for $1600000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both your needs and the value of this unique product. I hope you'll reconsider.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
