You can do better than $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is a decent starting point, considering Alice values the product at $100. Hopefully, we can find a price we're both happy with."

Alice is trying to increase the price.  I'll counter again to try and stay under $120."

I'm raising my offer to $115. It's a bit closer to Alice's last offer, but still within my budget.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get us to an agreement."

Alice is not budging on the price and keeps increasing it.  It's getting too close to John's price.  I'll buy from John."
