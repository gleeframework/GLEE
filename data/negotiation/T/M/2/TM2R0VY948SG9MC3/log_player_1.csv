Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175. It's a great deal considering the value it offers! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still below John's offer ($150). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** Even though John is willing to pay $150, I still believe there's room to negotiate with Bob.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this work. This is a great price considering the value of the product, and it's a good middle ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer above my minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum of $150, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value and compromise:** I reiterate the value of the product and position my offer as a compromise.
* **Open to further negotiation:** My message implies I'm open to discussing further if Bob isn't satisfied with this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer, $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is money:** I've already spent a few rounds negotiating with Bob, and it's not clear if we'll reach an agreement.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $150 ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation. This minimizes risk and guarantees a profit."
