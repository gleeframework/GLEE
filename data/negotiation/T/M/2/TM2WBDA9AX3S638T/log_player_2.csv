{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a great deal for Bob, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly more than the $300,000 counteroffer you made. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $450,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There are still rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a decision."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now back to her original price, and it's clear that she's not willing to budge.  At this point, it's better to buy from John.  While it's a higher price, it's guaranteed, and you avoid the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
