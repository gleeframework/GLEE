"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I know he values the product at $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $97 is a good deal for me. While I'd prefer to get my initial asking price of $105, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100 and we're already in round 4.  Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal with Bob and avoid the risk of him walking away or me needing to deal with John."
