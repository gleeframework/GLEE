"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. While $10,750 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $9,500? That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $10,200? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for me.",10200.0,Alice,5,
