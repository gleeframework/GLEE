Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10800. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth $12000 to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,800 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,600?  It's a fair price that's still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10600}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go below $11200. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $11200. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You have only 5 rounds left and it is unlikely Alice will come down to your price.  Therefore, it is best to buy from John and save $2,000."
