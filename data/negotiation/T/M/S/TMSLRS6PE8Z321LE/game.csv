"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10000 to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10800. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth $12000 to me.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10800 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10600?  It's a fair price that's still within my budget.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go below $11200. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $11200. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,5,
