"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident this product will exceed the value you place on it. Considering its potential, I can bring it down to $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price for what it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still believe $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the halfway point in the negotiation.  By stating this is our final offer, we're adding pressure on Bob while still leaving room to accept his price if he comes up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has not budged from his $1,075,000 offer, and we're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit above John's offer, and continuing to push risks Bob losing interest or our position weakening."
