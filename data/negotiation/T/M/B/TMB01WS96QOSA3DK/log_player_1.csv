"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value"" and ""unique opportunity,""  the message aims to frame the high price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room:** Even though John offers $1,000,000, starting negotiations with Bob much lower might leave potential profit on the table.  

This strategy allows Alice to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while still having the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've suggested. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant jump from his initial valuation of $800,000. This indicates a strong interest in the product and room for further negotiation. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, there's a good chance to secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  While the product's value is truly significant, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a price of $1,150,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice makes a substantial concession from her initial offer ($150,000), signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:** The counteroffer remains significantly above both Bob's valuation ($800,000) and his offer ($950,000). Alice is aiming for a price closer to her minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message continues to emphasize the product's value, subtly reminding Bob why he's interested. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price that maximizes Alice's profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I value your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant profit over John's standing offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating his serious interest in the product.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further prolonged negotiation which could lead to a less favorable outcome. 

While Alice *might* be able to extract a bit more from Bob, accepting this offer secures a very good profit and avoids unnecessary risk."
