"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$750,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.**  
* **We want to explore if we can get a better deal.**  
* **It's too early to buy from John without knowing Alice's true bottom line.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm aiming for a significant price reduction to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $150,000 drop is a substantial starting point. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Alice is serious about selling below her initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** While $600,000 is a strong initial counter, it still leaves space for negotiation and a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm, but not inflexible.**  The $50,000 drop from her original offer shows a willingness to negotiate, but still a considerable distance from my target.
* **More room to bargain.** I believe we can still get a better price than $700,000.  
* **John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up yet.** The goal is to save money, and a counteroffer could still lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($600,000) and Alice's latest offer ($700,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Signaling Serious Interest:** By increasing my offer, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to meet her halfway.
* **Testing the Limits:** This counteroffer will reveal if Alice is willing to budge further or if she's firmly set on $700,000. If she rejects, we'll have a clearer picture of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to my target.**  The price is now $725,000, only $25,000 away from my last counteroffer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal.** If I reject, there's a chance Alice will become more stubborn or even withdraw her offer altogether.
* **The price is within my budget.** While I'd prefer a lower price, I'm comfortable with $725,000.  The potential of saving $275,000 (compared to John) is worth it.
* **Time is a factor.**  We're halfway through the negotiations, and I want to avoid wasting more rounds."
