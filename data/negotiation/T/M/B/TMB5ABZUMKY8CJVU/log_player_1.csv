Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I believe it will be valuable to you, but if you're not interested, no worries!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While the product is worth $80 to Bob, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($100) leaves no money on the table. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is framed politely to maintain goodwill, but it clearly states that this is the price.  There's no negotiation implied, encouraging Bob to make a quick decision. 
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning you have other interested buyers, you subtly create a sense of urgency without being pushy.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for you (Alice)."
