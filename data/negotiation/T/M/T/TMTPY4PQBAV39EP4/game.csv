"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $11,500.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this product is worth it to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle *one more time* and come down to $11,250. This is my final offer before I have to seriously consider other options.  Think about it - this is a great product that's worth the investment.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I appreciate your persistence. To be honest, I'm starting to feel like we might not be able to find common ground.  However, to show you I'm still willing to work with you, I'm going to come down one last time to $11,200.  This is a very good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll take it.  If not, I'm afraid I'll have to move on to other options.",11200.0,Alice,9,
