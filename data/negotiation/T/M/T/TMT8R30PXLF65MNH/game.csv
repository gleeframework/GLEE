"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my final offer. I'd like to see if we can meet at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
