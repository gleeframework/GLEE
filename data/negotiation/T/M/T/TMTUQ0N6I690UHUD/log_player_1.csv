"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great value for you, considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $12,000, I allow for several rounds of negotiation before potentially having to accept a lower price or sell to John. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive and encouraging way, hoping to create a sense of value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go higher than $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I have 8 rounds left, giving me ample time to continue negotiations. 
* **Potential to increase the price:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob by rejecting his current offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500,  which is still a significant discount for you. This is my final offer before considering other options."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:**  While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm also showing flexibility by offering a lower price than my initial offer. This signals that I'm committed to making a deal but am also willing to stand my ground on price.
* **Setting a firm price:**  By calling this my ""final offer,"" I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Playing the waiting game:** I have 7 rounds left, so I can still walk away and sell to John if Bob refuses to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I have 6 rounds remaining and I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the leverage to potentially get a better price or sell to John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can't go any lower than $11,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  I'm offering a small reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a high price. 
* **Framing the offer positively:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price and highlighting the value the product will provide to Bob. 
* **Pressure for a decision:** I'm signaling that I'm close to my limit, encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Still above my minimum:**  This offer keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
