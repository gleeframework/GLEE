{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the first offer. This allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within my budget. My goal is to see if Alice is willing to negotiate and how much she's willing to come down."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,200 is still higher than my initial counteroffer, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. There's still room to get a better price, and I want to see how far she's willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Explanation:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,000 is getting closer to my preferred price, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get her down even further. Since I have 5 rounds left, there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $7,800. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept, but if not, I still have several rounds left to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $7,900 is very close to my last counteroffer of $7,800. It's a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than my initial budget of $15,000 and I'm getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. With only three rounds left, it's a good time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially causing a breakdown."
