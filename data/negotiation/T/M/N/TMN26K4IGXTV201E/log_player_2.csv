"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a low counter-offer that is significantly below Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A low counter-offer will help us understand how eager Alice is to sell and how much lower she might be willing to go. 
* **Work towards a favorable price:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets a lower starting point for future negotiations, potentially leading to a price closer to our target of $8,000 or below."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $9,000 is still above our target price. Since we have room to negotiate (our maximum is $8,000), we'll reject this offer and propose a counter-offer in the next round, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $7,500? That would be a great compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  We're proposing a price that's roughly halfway between our last offer ($6,000) and Alice's current offer ($9,000). This shows willingness to negotiate and reach a fair agreement. 
* **Staying below our limit:**  Our offer of $7,500 keeps us below our maximum budget of $8,000 while leaving some room for potential further negotiation if needed. 
* **Encouraging a deal:** By framing our counter-offer as a ""great compromise,"" we're encouraging Alice to accept and close the deal."
