"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $7,500? That would be a great compromise for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
