"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value and could greatly benefit your work. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm happy to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to look elsewhere. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, I can't accept anything below $1,500,000. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you.  How about we settle at $1,500,000 and close the deal?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
