# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value and could greatly benefit your work. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high, but she's moving in the right direction.  It's time to make another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm happy to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to look elsewhere. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, I can't accept anything below $1,500,000. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you.  How about we settle at $1,500,000 and close the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price of $800,000.  While we're getting closer, there's no guarantee we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  I'm better off buying from John and saving the time and effort of continued negotiation."
