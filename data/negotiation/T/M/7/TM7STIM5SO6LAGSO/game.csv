"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I respect your valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $140 for the product. This still reflects its value to me, while remaining competitive with your offer. Please let me know if this is something you'd consider.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $140 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $135?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close this deal.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to suggest a price of $137.50.
