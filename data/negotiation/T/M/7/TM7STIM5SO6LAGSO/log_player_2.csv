Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to suggest a price of $137.50.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $137.50 is very close to my target price of $135.  Considering we are in the middle of the negotiation and I'm limited to 10 rounds, it makes sense to accept this offer and close the deal. It's a good price for me, and I've saved $12.50 compared to John's offer."
