"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a fair price, considering you're still making a decent profit. Let's try to make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000.

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,025,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This is my final offer.  I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
