Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. This is a fantastic deal considering its value and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below Bob's maximum value leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. It's unlikely Bob will counter with a price so low that Alice would prefer John's offer. 
* **Time Value of Money:** While not explicitly stated, selling to Bob immediately might be slightly preferable to waiting for John, even if the price difference is small."
