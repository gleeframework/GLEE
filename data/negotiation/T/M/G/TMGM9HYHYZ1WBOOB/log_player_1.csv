Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately close the deal.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I show Bob I'm not desperate for a quick sale. 
* **Explore potential for a better deal:** By making a counteroffer, I might be able to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Secure a backup option:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $100 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get great value from this product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise,  splitting the difference between my last offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate that the product is valuable and the price reflects that.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable. 

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still holding firm on a price that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. How about $85? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that we're not close to a deal.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell to John for $100. This ensures:

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer provides a certain profit, eliminating any risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take longer and might not result in a higher price.
* **Minimizing Potential Loss:**  If I keep negotiating with Bob, there's a chance he'll walk away entirely, leaving me with nothing. 

By selling to John, I'm securing a reliable profit and moving on to other opportunities."
