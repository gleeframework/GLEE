"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000, but I'm willing to come down to $810,000 to make the deal work. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,3,
