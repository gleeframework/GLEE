"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product is intriguing, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John for $10,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $12,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower",12200.0,Alice,5,
