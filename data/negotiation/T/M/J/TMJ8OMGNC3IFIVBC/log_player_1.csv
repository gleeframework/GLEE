Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're making a profit of $20.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob is likely to consider this a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you can adjust your price accordingly. 

By starting with this offer, you set a reasonable starting point for the negotiation while also keeping your profits in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product and your willingness to sell. I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly lower than the $100 offer you initially made.  You're aiming for a higher profit, and Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price closer to your initial $100, perhaps $95. This demonstrates you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still gives you a good deal, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-point compromise:** This offer splits the difference between your initial $100 offer and Bob's $85 counteroffer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin.
* **Emphasis on a win-win:** The message focuses on the benefits for both of you, highlighting that a $95 price would be a good deal for Bob while still being profitable for you. 
* **Open-ended question:** The question ""What do you say?"" invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable deal:**  Selling the product for $90 gives you a profit of $10, which is better than the $80 you would get from selling to John.
* **Limited negotiation room:** Bob's counteroffer is only $5 less than your most recent offer. Continuing to negotiate may lead to a lower final price, risking a smaller profit.
* **Time consideration:**  The back-and-forth negotiation has already taken some time. Accepting this offer allows you to finalize the sale and move on to other potential opportunities.

While you could attempt to negotiate further, the risk of ending up with a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher profit. Accepting Bob's offer at $90 is the most sensible option at this point."
