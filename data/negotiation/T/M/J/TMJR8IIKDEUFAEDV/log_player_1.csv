"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob helps him see the potential benefits of accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's room to negotiate further, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Avoiding Settling:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I'm motivated to maximize my earnings. 

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Positive Outcome:**  The language emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are in round 4, and time is running out. There's a risk that further negotiations could lead to a lower price or no deal at all.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a deal with a slightly lower but still acceptable price. 

It's a calculated risk, but I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal rather than risk losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John."
