"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. How about we discuss $10,250? This is a reasonable price that should be acceptable to both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
