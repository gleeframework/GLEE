"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while also making it clear that I value the product highly.  It's important to remember that my minimum acceptable price is $15,000, and I can always switch to selling to John at that price if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still potential to get a better deal. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also showcasing that I still believe the product is worth more than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and it's getting closer to my initial asking price. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price."
