"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $155. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",155.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $145. I'm thinking more along the lines of $152.50. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's worth it for this product.",152.5,Alice,7,
