Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John offers a guaranteed $12,000, Alice should aim to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, while still securing a near-maximum profit for Alice.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The $11,999 price point feels significantly less than $12,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. It does not factor in potential relationship building with Bob for future deals."
