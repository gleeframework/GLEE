"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to me. However, I understand it may not be your ideal price. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, saving him $250,000."
