I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer but still gives me a profit margin. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, as it's approaching the value he places on the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We're very close to my minimum price, but I believe I can still push for a bit more.  Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price with one more counteroffer."
