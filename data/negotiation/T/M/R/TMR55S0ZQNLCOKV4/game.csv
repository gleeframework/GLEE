"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, how about we meet halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still outside my range.  Let's try $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,000 is still too low. How about we settle at $13,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  Let's try to make a deal here.",10000.0,Bob,6,
