Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $95 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, but lower than Bob's perceived value of $100.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you a good profit.  

Let me know how the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to propose a price of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below the desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for a potential counteroffer that might be closer to the desired $95 price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to go down to $90.  That's a great price for such a great product! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87 is still a bit lower than I'd like, it's only $2 less than my minimum acceptable price.  Given Bob's persistence and potential for further negotiation, it's better to accept this offer and close the deal.  More rounds of negotiation could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, and I'm confident I can find other buyers in the future who are willing to pay closer to my asking price."
