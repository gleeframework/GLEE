Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his budget. He should proceed to counteroffer and see if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should start by offering the maximum he's willing to pay, which is $800,000. This makes it clear that he's serious about the purchase but also leaves room for some potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's budget, and he knows John is willing to sell for his maximum price. There's no point in further negotiation with Alice as he's already at his limit."
