"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value of the product, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $80 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your maximum, but I'm still not sure if I'm willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $81.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",81.5,Alice,5,
