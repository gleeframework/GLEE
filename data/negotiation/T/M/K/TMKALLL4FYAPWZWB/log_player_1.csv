"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm confident in the product's value, and also leaves room for potential compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from $130, and I've already rejected his offer once in the previous round. While I'd prefer to earn more, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $30, which is better than selling to John for $100."
