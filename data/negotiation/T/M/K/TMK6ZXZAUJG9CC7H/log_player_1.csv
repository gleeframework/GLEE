Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about $105? This is a fair price that's still within your budget."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $95 is a good price and  it's better than selling to John for $80.  Also, we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
