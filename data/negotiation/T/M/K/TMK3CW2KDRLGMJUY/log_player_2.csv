"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is way too high.** You're only willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate.** There are 10 rounds, so you have time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** But, since you haven't seen what Alice will counteroffer, it's best to explore negotiation first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  I'm starting low to show Alice that I'm serious about saving money. This is a significant drop from her initial price, but still within the realm of possibility. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she's adamant about her initial price, I'll know I need to be more conservative in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a step down from her initial offer, it's still beyond my maximum budget.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.**  I still have time to try and reach a price closer to my target.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** But, since Alice is showing some flexibility, it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to my target:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's current price. 
* **Showing good faith:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and meet her halfway, but still trying to achieve a good price.
* **Keeping the pressure on:** If she rejects this offer, it'll push her to consider a lower price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  It's not a significant decrease from her previous offer, and I'm still determined to get a price closer to my target.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive.**  I have several rounds left, and I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** But, I'm seeing signs of Alice's willingness to come down, so it's worth seeing if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final push:** This counteroffer is a significant jump from my previous offer and is getting very close to my maximum budget. 
* **Testing the waters:** This is a ""take it or leave it"" type of offer.  If Alice rejects it, it's highly likely that she won't budge further, and I'll probably end up buying from John. 
* **Showing commitment:** By increasing my offer, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product, but still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to my budget, but I'm not willing to pay that much, especially with only three rounds left.
* **Negotiation is becoming too risky.**  Alice has shown a reluctance to budge significantly. With few rounds left, there's a high chance we won't reach a deal.
* **Buying from John offers a guaranteed price.** It's within my budget, and I can secure the product without further negotiation.

At this point, it's more advantageous to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal from John.  There's a higher risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice, and time is running out."
