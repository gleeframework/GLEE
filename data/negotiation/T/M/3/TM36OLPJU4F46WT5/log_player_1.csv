Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,200,000.  I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $1,200,000 sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. While it's a significant amount above your minimum, it leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and focusing on the ""return on investment"" helps justify the high price to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to share his thoughts, opening the door for potential counter-offers.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize your profit by leveraging Bob's higher valuation. 
* There's a risk that Bob might reject the initial offer. However, having John as a backup buyer guarantees you'll at least meet your minimum selling price."
