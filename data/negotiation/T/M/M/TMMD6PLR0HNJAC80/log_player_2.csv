It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially with a significant price difference. You can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 
This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It shows that you are serious about buying the product, but you are also determined to get a good deal. This will push Alice to consider your offer and hopefully lead to a compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still higher than what you're comfortable with. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price.  You still have room to bargain before having to resort to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise but are still pushing for a lower price. It's a reasonable middle ground, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
