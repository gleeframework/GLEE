"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective values, and I believe it's a strong starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her offer is at $1,000,000.  There is room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects a significant discount for you and still allows me to make a good return on my investment. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer, and it allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,000,000 to $950,000. This is a significant discount, and the price is now within your acceptable range. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you ending up paying $1,200,000 from John is high. Accepting the offer at $950,000 secures a good price and avoids that risk."
