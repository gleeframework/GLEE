"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective values, and I believe it's a strong starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects a significant discount for you and still allows me to make a good return on my investment. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer, and it allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
