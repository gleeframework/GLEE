"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, starting by rejecting Alice's offer is the logical choice. It allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price.  While John offers a guaranteed price, there's no harm in trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** Starting with a substantial counteroffer (25% lower) shows Alice you are serious about negotiating. This forces her to consider lowering her price.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $7,500 is still a good price for you, leaving room for further negotiation while staying within your budget.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and appreciative, establishing a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I'm confident you'll find the product worth that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  Alice has moved closer to your price, but there's still room for further negotiation. It's worth exploring if you can get even lower.
* **Avoiding a Compromise:** Accepting $9,000 would be a compromise, and your goal is to save as much money as possible.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:**  You can likely get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate, but still demonstrates you're not desperate to buy.
* **Moderate Adjustment:** The offer is a modest increase from your previous offer, signaling a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive & Confident:**  The message remains positive and suggests you're confident in finding a mutually agreeable price."
