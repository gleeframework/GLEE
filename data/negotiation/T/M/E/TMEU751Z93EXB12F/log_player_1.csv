"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but not too high that it immediately seems unreasonable. I'm also setting a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product. This is the beginning of the negotiation, and I want to gauge Bob's interest without scaring him off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find the product worth that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum price of $8,000 and also above what John is offering.  It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept his offer."
