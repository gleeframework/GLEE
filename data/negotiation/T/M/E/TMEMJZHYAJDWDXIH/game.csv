"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential return on investment for you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  It's a fair price that considers both our perspectives.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
