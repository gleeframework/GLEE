# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Bob should reject the offer. $950,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price through negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential return on investment for you.

While $925,000 is better than the previous offer, it's still not ideal.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $900,000. This price reflects the significant value this product holds for you, while still acknowledging the effort we've both put into reaching an agreement.

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $900,000. While he could potentially continue negotiating and try to get the price down further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and he'll have to buy from John for $1,000,000. At $900,000, Bob is still getting a good deal, and it's unlikely he'll be able to get a significantly better price."
