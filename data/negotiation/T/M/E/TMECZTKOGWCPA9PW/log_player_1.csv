Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value, but the ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other interested parties"" create a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially leading to a higher final price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If Alice wants to guarantee the $1,200,000, she should offer it directly to Bob."
