Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still above my price point. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. This is a fair price given the value the product holds for me. It's a win-win situation for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to acquire it within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Bob is firmly rooted at $800,000 and unlikely to budge. It's clear further negotiation won't bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me. Accepting John's offer of $1,500,000 is the best way to maximize my return in this scenario."
