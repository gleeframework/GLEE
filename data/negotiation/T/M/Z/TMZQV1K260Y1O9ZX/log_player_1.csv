Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Strategic Thinking:** I'm not starting too high, as it might scare Bob off immediately. I'm also keeping the option open to accept a counteroffer or sell to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below the value I place on the product. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me. While I am willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that undervalues the product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price or, if necessary, sell to John for a much higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand you have a budget. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $10,000? This is still a good deal for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to get a valuable product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $10,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also appealing to his sense of fairness by suggesting a middle ground.
* **Strategic Thinking:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I'm keeping the option open to sell to John if Bob continues to refuse."
