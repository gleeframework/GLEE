"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $118 is still lower than buying from John for $120, so it's the best option in this scenario. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your next counteroffer and you'd end up paying more. It's better to take the current offer and secure the purchase."
