"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating further.  There's no reason to rush into a decision when there are still 9 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $70? "", ""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $70 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $75, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Be polite and appreciative:**  Starting the negotiation with a positive tone helps build rapport and increase the chance of a successful deal.
* **Focus on your desired price:**  Clearly stating that Bob is looking to spend less emphasizes his motivation for negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about this: $72 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** $72 is a good compromise, closer to Bob's desired price of $70. 
* **Limited time:**  With only 7 rounds left, it's important to consider the potential of getting a better deal versus the risk of losing out on this offer.
* **Value comparison:** $72 is still significantly less than buying from John for $80."
