"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're close, but $1,150,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my absolute minimum price. If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
