# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, but it's getting closer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again, as you're getting closer to your goal of buying the product at a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close, but $1,150,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my absolute minimum price. If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget of $1,200,000. This is a good deal for you, as you're buying the product at the lowest possible price while still meeting your own financial goals.  It would be pointless to reject this offer, as it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds."
