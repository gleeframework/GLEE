"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll see if we can get closer in the next round, but I'm also considering selling to John as a backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $1,150,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my absolute minimum price. If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
