Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to keep my purchase under $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet the minimum price. It's more profitable to sell to John for $10,000."
