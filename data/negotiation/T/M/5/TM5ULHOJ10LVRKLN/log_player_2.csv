"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and potentially get closer to his $8,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial price.  This sets the stage for negotiation, and Alice is likely to counter with a price closer to her original $12,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and $11,000 is still above his target.  By rejecting, he can continue to negotiate and potentially get closer to his $8,000 goal.  However, with only 7 rounds left, it's important to consider the risk of not closing a deal with Alice and potentially being forced to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate but still trying to get a good deal.  By offering $9,500, Bob is showing flexibility while maintaining his desire to stay below $10,000. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's acceptable range, and there's a high chance that continuing to negotiate might not result in a lower price. Considering that there are only 5 rounds left, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of not securing a deal at all and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
