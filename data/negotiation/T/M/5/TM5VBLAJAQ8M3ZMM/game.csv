"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,300 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident we can close this deal if I can get it for $8,100. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'd be happy with the sale.",8100.0,Bob,6,
