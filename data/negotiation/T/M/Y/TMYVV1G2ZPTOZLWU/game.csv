"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,800. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $10,800 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This would still leave you a good margin for profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,900? I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",10900.0,Bob,4,
