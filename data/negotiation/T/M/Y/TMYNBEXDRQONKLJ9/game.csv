"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $95.
