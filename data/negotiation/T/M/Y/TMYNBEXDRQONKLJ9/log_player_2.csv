Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $92. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $92 secures a reasonable price compared to John's $120 offer."
