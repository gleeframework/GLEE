"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a one-of-a-kind item, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you for $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8250. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $7000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $7500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,5,
