"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. If you're interested, let me know, and we can discuss the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still save $200,000 by rejecting her offer.  Since you have a fallback option with John, it's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or potentially find another seller."
