Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, giving me some wiggle room.  I'm hoping to strike a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that low.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This would still give me a decent return on my investment, and I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob.  He's already shown that he's not willing to pay more than his perceived value. It's more secure to sell to John for $150 and ensure I get a profitable return."
