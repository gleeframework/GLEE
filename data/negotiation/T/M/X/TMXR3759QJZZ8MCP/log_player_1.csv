{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent price.  It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a desperate position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low for me.  It's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could always sell to John for $15,000, I'll see if I can get closer to that price with Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, but $9,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price.  It's clear Bob is not willing to meet my needs.  I'm better off selling to John for $15,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
