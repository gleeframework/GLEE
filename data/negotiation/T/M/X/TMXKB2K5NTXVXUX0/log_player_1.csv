"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $180 for it."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm also trying to be friendly and positive in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I will reject it and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $120? I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm still aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility to keep the negotiation going. I'm also emphasizing fairness to appeal to Bob's sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $75?  That would work much better for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $75, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That would be a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that is closer to Bob's offer, but still within my acceptable range.  I'm also emphasizing compromise to make it seem like a fair solution for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $100 is close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $80. How about we settle at $85? That's a fair bit closer to your last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing him completely. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
