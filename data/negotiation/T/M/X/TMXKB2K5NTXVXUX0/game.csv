"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $180 for it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $120? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $75?  That would work much better for my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $75, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That would be a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $100 is close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $80. How about we settle at $85? That's a fair bit closer to your last offer.",85.0,Bob,6,
