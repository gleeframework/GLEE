,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a good starting point, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. The product is really valuable, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit far from $135. How about we meet at $125? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $125, but I'm still not willing to give up on the value of the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $130. It's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're getting close to your minimum, but I'm still not willing to give up on the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $127, which would be $128.50. It's a fair compromise considering the product's worth. What do you think?",128.5,Alice,7,
