"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum threshold. This is a good starting point to see if he's interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about $135? It's still a good price, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $135 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $132.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $134? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 134}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away from this deal, but I still really want the product. How about we meet at $131.25? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoid further negotiations."
