Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, it implies a high value by using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""well worth the asking price."" 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high starting price leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You can always lower the price slightly and still make a significant profit.

This strategy aims to get you the best possible deal while keeping Bob's valuation in mind."
