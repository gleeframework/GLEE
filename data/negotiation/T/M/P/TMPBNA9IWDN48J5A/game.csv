"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $930,000? That's a significant move on my part.",930000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to emphasize that this is already a significant concession from my end. I'm confident that this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I can see we're really close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but I need to emphasize that this is as low as I can go. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value to you. Let's finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",960000.0,Alice,7,
