"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider buying it for something closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $120? It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $100? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",100.0,Alice,5,
