"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price point that makes sense for your needs. I know you're interested, so I hope you'll consider it! If you decide to pass, I've already got another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible.",900000.0,Alice,1,
