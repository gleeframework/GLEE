Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $900,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a meeting point."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm not in a hurry to sell, and I have a few more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and would be a fair outcome for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've thought about it, and I'm still comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, so please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're now at round 6, and while I'd prefer a higher price, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further.  $950,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm happy with this outcome."
