"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $650,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
