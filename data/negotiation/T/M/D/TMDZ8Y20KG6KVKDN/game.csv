"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can do $700,000. That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to drop to $850,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
