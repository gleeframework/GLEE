"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value. I'm confident you'll see the potential here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and allows me to maximize my profit.  I'm also framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop to that price so early in the process. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can do $700,000. That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to drop to $850,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
