"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value. I'm confident you'll see the potential here.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can do $700,000. That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to drop to $850,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below your backup option of $800,000.  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John to save time and potential further negotiation hassle."
