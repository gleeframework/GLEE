"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $12,000. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is only worth $8,000 to her. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice in a subsequent round."
