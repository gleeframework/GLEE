Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 allows for some back and forth if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering it too low might make Bob think it's less valuable than it is.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale, as we have the safety net of John's offer at $80."
