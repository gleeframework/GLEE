**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to push the price down further with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This price would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we settle at $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $10,250.** This is closer to Bob's ideal price than John's offer of $12,000.
* **The negotiation has gone back and forth, and Bob has already made multiple counteroffers.**  It's likely that further negotiations will lead to even smaller price reductions, and there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further.
* **There's a potential for Alice to become frustrated with the negotiation process and walk away.** If this happens, Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price.

**Overall, accepting Alice's offer of $10,250 is the most practical decision for Bob, as it allows him to secure the product at a price that is still within his budget and a good deal compared to John's offer.**"
