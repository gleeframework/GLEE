"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting from the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This price would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we settle at $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",10250.0,Alice,5,
