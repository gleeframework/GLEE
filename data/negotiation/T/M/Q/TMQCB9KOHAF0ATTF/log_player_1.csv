"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, knowing Bob values the product at $120. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  By not going for the full $120, I acknowledge the potential for negotiation and make a counteroffer more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is still higher:** While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe I can still get closer to my $100 asking price by counteroffering. 
* **Keeping options open:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing me to potentially achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** I'm offering a middle ground, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting that $95 is a fair deal for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Maintain friendly tone:** I continue to be friendly and engaging to keep the negotiation positive."
