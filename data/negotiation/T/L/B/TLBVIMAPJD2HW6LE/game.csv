"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further and counteroffer at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
