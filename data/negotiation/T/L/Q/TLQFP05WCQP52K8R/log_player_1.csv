"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to the middle ground between our values, to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $950,000. This is a good compromise point that still leaves some room for negotiation while also showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $920,000, which is very close to my target price.  While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal to John is too high.  I'll accept the offer and move on."
