Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm offering it at $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. However, there's also the risk that continued negotiation might not lead to a significantly better outcome than John's offer.

Here's how I'll approach this:

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}** 

I'll reject Bob's offer but leave room for further negotiation. I need to signal that while I'm open to discussion, I'm not desperate to sell at such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my minimum. However, I still have some wiggle room and rounds to go.  

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**

I'll reject Bob's offer, but my counteroffer this time will be a smaller increment to signal I'm getting closer to my limit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work. How about $8,800? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8800}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob is holding firm at $8,500, and it seems unlikely he'll go much higher.  He's repeated this offer twice, indicating it might be his upper limit. I'm not going to get to $9,000.

**{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}**

It's time to accept Bob's offer of $8,500. It's a reasonable profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate has a high risk of ending up with John's $8,000 offer."
