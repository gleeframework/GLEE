"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $5,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This product offers significant value, and I believe this is a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $6,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $6,500 is significantly less than what I can offer.  I can go as low as $10,000. I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a product like this.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell this product means a lot to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $7,500? That's the highest I can go.",7500.0,Bob,6,
