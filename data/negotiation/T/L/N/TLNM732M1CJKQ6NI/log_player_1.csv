Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him an incentive to buy.

This strategy aims to quickly find a mutually beneficial price without risking losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your desired profit margin:** Selling for $110 would mean a significant loss for you.
* **Continue negotiating:** You can counteroffer with a price closer to your desired range.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price and keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested. $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I've lowered my price from $140 to $125, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a profitable price:**  $125 still meets my minimum price requirement and ensures I make a profit. 
* **Framing it positively:** I emphasize the deal being good for Bob and highlighting the value of the product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $120? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on the sale and can still make a profit.  Since John is also offering $120, there's no real advantage to delaying further."
