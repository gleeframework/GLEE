,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable meeting you at $150. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $160, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $160?",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $160, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you there. How about we compromise at $175?",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we do $170?",170.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I still think I can do better than $170. How about we meet at $185?",185.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I'll have to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $165, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100",165.0,Bob,8,
