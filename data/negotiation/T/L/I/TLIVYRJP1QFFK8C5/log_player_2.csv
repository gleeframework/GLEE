Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $75. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $68. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $72. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

We've reached a reasonable price point.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might irritate her.  It's better to secure the deal at $72."
