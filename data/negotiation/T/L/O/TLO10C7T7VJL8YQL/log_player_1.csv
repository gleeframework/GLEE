{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable starting point, giving Bob the impression that you're willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, and it aligns with what John is willing to pay.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
