As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and your initial offer.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer on the price. To be honest, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could go as high as $900,000, but that's really my limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,
