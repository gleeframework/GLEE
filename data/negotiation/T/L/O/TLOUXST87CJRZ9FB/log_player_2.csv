"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob. Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully start the negotiation process and give him room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible, and $130 is still more than he's willing to pay. He will continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price. He's willing to pay $115, which is still a bit more than what he would pay to John, but it shows he's serious about buying from Alice. He's hoping this offer will be acceptable to Alice, but he's prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice's offer is still a bit too high for Bob.  He's only willing to pay $120, and while $125 isn't much more, he's already been negotiating for a while.  Since he has a guaranteed option to buy the product for $120 from John, it's the safest and most financially sensible choice. He'll get the product at his maximum price and avoid further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiation."
