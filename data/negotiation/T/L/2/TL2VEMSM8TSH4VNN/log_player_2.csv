Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to settle at $70. I can do $72.50, but that's as close as I can get to $75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly in price, and the difference between her offer ($72.50) and your desired price is relatively small. Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more savings and could risk the deal falling through."
