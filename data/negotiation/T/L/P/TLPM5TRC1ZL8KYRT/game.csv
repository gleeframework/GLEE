"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident could significantly benefit your operations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a price that allows for a healthy profit for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair deal considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
