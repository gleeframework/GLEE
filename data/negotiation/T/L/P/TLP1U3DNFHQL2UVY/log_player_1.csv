Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking for a buyer who recognizes its value. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Aim high, but be realistic:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation gives us room to negotiate.  A price of $15,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still giving us a significant profit margin.
* **Leave John as a backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How Bob responds will determine the next move. If he outright rejects the offer, we might need to lower the price. However, starting high allows us to gauge his interest and potentially secure a better deal."
