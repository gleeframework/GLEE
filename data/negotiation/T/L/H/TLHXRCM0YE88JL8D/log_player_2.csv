"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. Considering its value and quality, I suggest we start our negotiation at $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if I can get a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This strategy is to start with a significantly lower offer than my budget. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your interest in the product, Bob. To reach a fair agreement, how about we aim for $75? This still reflects the value of the product while being more approachable for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign. However,  $75 is still too high for me. I'll counteroffer again to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $68?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 68
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims for a price closer to my budget while still showing willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping Alice will be open to finding a price we both find acceptable."
