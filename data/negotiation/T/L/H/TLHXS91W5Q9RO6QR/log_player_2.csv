"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it for $14,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Alice.
* **Current Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $14,000.

At this point, Bob is getting a good deal.  The price is lower than John's price and closer to Alice's minimum. Accepting this offer means Bob saves $1,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might save Bob a few more dollars, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of time with John's offer makes accepting the current offer the best option."
