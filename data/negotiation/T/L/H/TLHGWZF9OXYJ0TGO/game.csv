"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This takes into account the value you place on the product and allows me to achieve a reasonable profit. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite at $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. Can we meet in the middle?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $825,000 is simply too low. Let's find a compromise at $850,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
