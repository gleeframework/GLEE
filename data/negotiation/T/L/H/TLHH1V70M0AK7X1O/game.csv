"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference between $10,000 and $14,000? I could do $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $12,000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
