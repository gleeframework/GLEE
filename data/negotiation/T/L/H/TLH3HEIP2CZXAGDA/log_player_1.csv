Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it allows me to sell the product quickly without risking further negotiation."
