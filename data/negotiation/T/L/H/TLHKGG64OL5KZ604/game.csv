"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $60. I'm willing to make a compromise, though. How about $100? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $90? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",90.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $85, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal.
