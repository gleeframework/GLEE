{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique and valuable product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2,000,000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) as I have no information about Bob's value perception. This gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Building Value:** I emphasize the product's unique and valuable nature to pique Bob's interest and potentially increase his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I make it clear I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate.  This keeps the negotiation open and shows I'm not inflexible.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk:**  This strategy is a bit risky, as Bob might reject the offer outright.
* **John's Offer:** The threat of selling to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net.  If the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes unfavorable, I have a guaranteed fallback option.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** My next moves will depend on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2000000 is way above my budget.  I'm genuinely interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is too low, it demonstrates his interest in the product.  This suggests there's room for negotiation, and I can potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Rejection as a Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer is a strategic move. It sends a message that I'm serious about my asking price and that I'm not willing to settle for a drastically lower amount. This could encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still considering his stated budget constraints. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I will keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fall through or become too unfavorable."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $500,000 is definitely below my minimum price point, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, and I'm prepared to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000.  This allows you to stay within a reasonable budget and provides me with a more acceptable return on my investment.  Let's continue to explore this possibility."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Interest:** I start by thanking Bob for his interest, building a positive rapport despite the rejection of my previous offer.
* **Compromise and Justification:** I make it clear that I'm willing to compromise by lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,200,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still holding firm on my minimum value. I further justify the price by highlighting the potential value the product will bring to Bob.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value proposition for Bob, framing the $1,200,000 price as a worthwhile investment. 
* **Maintain Openness:** I end by stating that I'm open to further exploration, keeping the negotiation process active and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's still interested.

**Important Notes:**

* **Balancing Compromise and Value:** This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between meeting Bob's budget limitations and ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum value. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer, and I'll continue to monitor the negotiation to ensure I don't end up losing a significant amount of money.
* **Next Steps:**  I will closely analyze Bob's next response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this counteroffer, I will need to carefully consider whether to make another counteroffer, increase the price, or ultimately sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair return, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer of $800,000 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Selling at this price would mean a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation Space Remaining:**  Bob has clearly demonstrated his interest in the product and his willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's potential for further compromise. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer again sends a clear message that I'm committed to achieving a price that meets my minimum value. It also puts pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, but considering Bob's current offer of $800,000.
* **John as Backup:**  I will continue to keep John's offer in mind, providing a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails to reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Important Note:** It's essential to maintain a balance between compromise and maintaining my minimum value. My goal is to secure the best possible price while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
