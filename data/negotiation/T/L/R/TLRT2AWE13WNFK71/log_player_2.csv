Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $180.  This product is really top-notch, and I'm confident you'd find it worthwhile.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but I have to be honest, $95 is just too low for me to consider.  If I were to let it go, the absolute lowest I could go is $160. This is a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $160, and it's better to secure the product for $100 from John than risk further negotiation."
