Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will give you an idea of his level of interest and potential for negotiation. If he accepts immediately, you might have been able to sell for even more. If he rejects, you can start working your way down towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $80 is far below your minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his initial offer is low, it indicates some interest. There's room to negotiate upwards towards a more reasonable price. 
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of selling to John for $150, so you don't need to settle for a lowball offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $180.  This product is really top-notch, and I'm confident you'd find it worthwhile."",
""product_price"": 180
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction but Above Minimum:**  This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate but stays well above your $150 minimum and even above John's offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value aims to justify the higher price and shift Bob's focus from just the price difference.
* **Leaving Room:** There's still some room to negotiate downwards if needed, but this counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving in a positive direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a budget in mind.  How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $95 is still significantly below your $150 minimum and John's standing offer.
* **Testing Commitment:**  Continuing to reject low offers helps you gauge Bob's true interest and willingness to meet closer to your price. If he walks away, it wasn't meant to be.
* **John as Safety Net:** You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to confidently negotiate for a price that reflects the product's value to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but I have to be honest, $95 is just too low for me to consider.  If I were to let it go, the absolute lowest I could go is $160. This is a final offer."",
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer conveys firmness while still showing some flexibility.  
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a serious decision.
* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down to $160 is a significant drop, making it more appealing but still maintaining a profit margin above John's offer. 
* **Clear Expectations:** This message clearly outlines your bottom line and sets the stage for Bob's final decision."
