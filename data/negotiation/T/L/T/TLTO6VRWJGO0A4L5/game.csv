"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1000000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1250000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's work together to reach a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
