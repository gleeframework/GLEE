Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a calculated risk. Here's why:

* **High Offer:**  A price of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This is a gamble that Bob values the product enough to pay more.
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts, I make a substantial profit. 
* **Potential for Loss:** If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed the $1,000,000 from John, so I don't lose money.

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to maximize my potential earnings, but I'm also aware of the risk.  I've chosen a price that I believe is high enough to tempt Bob but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response carefully and will be prepared to negotiate further if needed.  I'll also be considering how I can present the value of the product to Bob in a way that emphasizes its worth to him."
