Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy**

The key is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while ensuring you get more than John's offer. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This represents a significant discount compared to its true worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It highlights the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial to Bob. 
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's closer to Bob's valuation, giving him a sense of getting a good deal while still securing a substantial profit for you ($150,000 above John's offer).

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have some wiggle room before reaching John's offer of $1,000,000."
