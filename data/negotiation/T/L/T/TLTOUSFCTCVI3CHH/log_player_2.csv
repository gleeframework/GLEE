"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This reflects the true worth and potential I see in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, and buying from John is always an option if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I understand the value you see in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is my first and best offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still shows that you're serious about buying the product. This leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring you don't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your initial offer falls quite short of reflecting the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still much higher than my budget. I can see she's willing to negotiate, which is good. I'm going to counter-offer again, trying to get closer to my target price.  I still have time and buying from John is always an option, so I'm not pressured to accept a high price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that this product holds significant value, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push towards my budget while staying within a reasonable range.  This offer is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. It also provides Alice with a fair price that still allows her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,700,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target, $1,700,000 is still over my budget.  I'm going to counter-offer again. I've got time on my side, and buying from John is always a safe option if things don't work out. I need to try to squeeze out a bit more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  your offer is getting closer to what I can afford. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, it's still below my maximum budget, leaving room for potential negotiation. I'm putting pressure on Alice by stating this is my final offer, hoping to incentivize her to accept. I still have options to buy from John if things don't work out."
