"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for your product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This still provides me with a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1750000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm offering $1500000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,
