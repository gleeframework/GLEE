"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value to give myself some room for negotiation. 
* **Framing it Positively:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" and the value Bob would get helps him see the potential benefit. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing for some back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I'm not yet ready to sell to John. There's still room for negotiation, and I have more rounds to try and get a better price. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500?  This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to recoup a fair amount of my value."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm still highlighting the ""good deal"" Bob gets at this price, reminding him of the product's worth. 
* **Maintaining My Minimum:** $11,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me some wiggle room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $11250 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreeable solution for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time for a Counteroffer:** I have more rounds to try and get a higher price.  I will counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach an agreement. 
* **Avoiding John's Deal:**  It's still too early to sell to John. There's a good chance I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but $11,250 is still a bit low. To make things easier, how about we split the difference?  Let's meet at $11,375.  That way, we both get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm aiming for a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a genuine effort to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  The message focuses on the concept of ""fairness"" and how both parties benefit from this price. This appeals to Bob's sense of logic and encourages a positive response.
* **Staying Above the Minimum:**  $11,375 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price, but getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $11300 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreeable solution for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $11,300 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We have only four rounds left, and I'm not confident that Bob will move much higher. There's a risk of ending up with a price below my minimum if I continue negotiating.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit that aligns with my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk getting a lower price by continuing to negotiate.

**Conclusion:** It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John."
