Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs and enhance your daily life.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, which is the face value of the product. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 135}"
