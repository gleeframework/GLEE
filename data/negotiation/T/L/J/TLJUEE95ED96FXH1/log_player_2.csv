"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's valuation and there's room for negotiation. I can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better price, Bob, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is willing to meet ""halfway"", it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to my desired price point.  There's still a gap between her offer and my desired price, so I'll reject and see if we can reach a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $825,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer, but reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $875,000 is close to my desired price range.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely we'll just go back and forth for a while.  Accepting her offer at this point gets me the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
