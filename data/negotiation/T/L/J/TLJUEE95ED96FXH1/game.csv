"I understand that you're looking for a better price, Bob, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $825,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer, but reflects the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
