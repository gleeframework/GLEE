Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $13,200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good price for a great product, if I do say so myself.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower. We're already below her initial offer and she's indicated this is close to her bottom line. 
* **Savings:** $13,200 is a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price.
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or us missing out on a good deal."
