{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try and negotiate, especially since you have 10 rounds. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant discount, hoping to get Alice to budge. This gives us room to negotiate and leaves $3,000 on the table for her to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is willing to move, so I'll keep negotiating. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer, but still leaving some room for Alice to feel like she's getting a good deal. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price.  While I could keep negotiating,  I'm not sure how much further Alice is willing to come down. It's a good price, and I want to avoid going through more rounds and potentially having to buy from John at the higher price."
