"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down a bit? Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $9,500 is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $10,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $10,000 even? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I can throw in some additional support and training to help you get the most out of the product. If you're willing to meet me at $10,250, I'll include this extra value. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
