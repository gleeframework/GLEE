"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",825000.0,Alice,3,,
