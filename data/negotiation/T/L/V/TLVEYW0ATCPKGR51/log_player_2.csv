"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $9,500. I think it's a great value for the quality and features it offers, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than your maximum budget of $10,000 and also less than what you would pay John.  This is a good deal for you, so you should accept it."
