"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the product truly holds significant potential beyond that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to compromise a bit, so how about we meet at $950,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $950,000 is too low for me to consider.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This offer stands for this round only; if you reject it, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $975,000. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $800,000.",975000.0,Bob,6,
