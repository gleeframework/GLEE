Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $125, and you can get the product for $120 from John."
