"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. I'm willing to buy the product for $8,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly higher than that, but still a good deal for you. How about $8,800?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm still only able to spend $8,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it. How about we say $9,000, and we can call it a deal?",9000.0,Alice,5,
