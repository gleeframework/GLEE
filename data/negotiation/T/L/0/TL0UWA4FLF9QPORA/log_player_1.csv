Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. I'm willing to buy the product for $8,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.
