"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  Let me know if this price range works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective on the value.  While I understand your initial offer, the $600,000 price point is quite a ways off from what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjustment. However,  $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I can offer up to $700,000.  This is a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from a reasonable offer. While moving closer to his price might encourage him, we have John as a reliable backup who will meet our desired value. We need to start pushing Bob closer to a serious offer, otherwise, we risk wasting negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still significant.  I need to see a more serious offer from you to continue this negotiation. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. I believe this revised offer reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're dropping our price, but making it clear to Bob that his offers need to significantly improve. This accomplishes two things: 
* **Signals seriousness:**  We're not wasting time with lowball offers.
* **Provides a target:**  Bob now sees a price closer to his, even though it's still above his stated budget. This may encourage a more reasonable counter.

We're getting closer to a point where accepting John's offer might be the better choice if Bob doesn't show significant movement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a substantial amount for this product.  To be honest, $1,600,000 is still beyond my initial budget. I can stretch to $750,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering it's more than half your initial asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has barely budged his offer, and calling it his ""final offer"" at $750,000 shows he's not seriously considering your valuation of the product.  It's unlikely he'll drastically change his position in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer of $1,500,000 is the best course of action now to ensure you get a fair price for your product."
