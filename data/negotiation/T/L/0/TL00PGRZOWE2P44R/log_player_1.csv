Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob before moving to John.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he got a deal. A price too close to $1,200,000 might scare him off, while a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will deliver significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value.
* **Confidence, Not Desperation:** ""Confident it will deliver..."" sounds better than ""I need to sell it...""
* **Fairness:** Emphasizing a ""fair deal"" can make the price more palatable.
* **Value Focus:**  Shifting focus to ""potential benefits"" downplays the actual price.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Be prepared to adjust if Bob counters. Having a counter-offer strategy in mind is crucial.
* **Relationship Matters:** While maximizing profit is key, consider your long-term relationship with Bob. A deal that's too one-sided might leave him resentful."
