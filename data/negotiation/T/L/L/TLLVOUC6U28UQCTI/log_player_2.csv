"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $14,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You still have 9 rounds to reach a deal with Alice.  Buying from John right now would be a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It demonstrates your willingness to buy, but also your desire to get a good deal. Alice values the product at $10,000, so this offer is still well above her floor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there is still room for negotiation. You can likely get the price down further.  Buying from John at this point would be a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer and Alice's latest one.  It shows you are willing to meet in the middle, but are still pushing for a better price.  You still have enough rounds to continue negotiating if necessary."
