Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** By mentioning you'll list the product publicly, you subtly signal to Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act, even though you have John as a backup.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price while still being realistic and appealing to Bob."
