"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $95. This is a special offer tailored specifically for you, considering its worth to you is $80. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is below her valuation, it's still higher than your maximum price of $80 and the guaranteed price from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer or allows you to proceed with buying from John at a better price."
