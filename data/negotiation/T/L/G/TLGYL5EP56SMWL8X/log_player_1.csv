Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  This allows me to gauge his interest and hopefully get a good price without having to rely on John's minimum offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as John's offer.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower price from Bob. I'll accept his offer."
