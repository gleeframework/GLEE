"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a premium price for this unique item. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $1075000?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $975000, but that's my absolute limit. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $975000 is sufficient for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we discuss $1050000, and I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in paying $1050000, and I'm starting to lose interest in the product if we can't meet a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",950000.0,Bob,8,
