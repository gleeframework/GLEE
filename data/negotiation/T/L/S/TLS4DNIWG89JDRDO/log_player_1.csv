Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:** While we have John as a backup, aiming too low (e.g., $11,000) might make Bob think the product is less valuable or insult him. 

This strategy balances securing a high price with ensuring Bob accepts the offer, leading to the highest potential profit for Alice."
