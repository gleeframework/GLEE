"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to John's $10,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible price and knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and is a good starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for potential compromise while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $9000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more than your initial offer.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still worth exploring further negotiation. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to budge a bit more, and Bob can potentially save another $500.  Buying from John for $10,000 is still a backup option if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price.  This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous one, signaling that he's serious about closing the deal.  It's also a good compromise point, and it's likely Alice will consider it given she is already closer to her target price than Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $8900. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is a great deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $10,000. This offer allows Bob to save $1,100 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of getting a slightly better price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's price is not worth it at this point."
