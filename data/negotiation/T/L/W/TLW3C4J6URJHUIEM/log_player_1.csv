Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm offering it to you first. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value, but the high price establishes the product's importance and leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down slightly or accept John's offer, ensuring you still meet your minimum price."
