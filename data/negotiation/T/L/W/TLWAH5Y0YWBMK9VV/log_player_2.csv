The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is asking for $150. This is way too high. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

I'm starting with a lower offer, as I know the product is worth $100 to me, but I want to see if I can get a better price."

While Alice's offer is closer to my value, it's still too high. I will reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price again."
