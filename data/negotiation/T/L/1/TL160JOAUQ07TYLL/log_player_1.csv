Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than John's offer, giving Bob an incentive to buy, but it's not outrageously high, making it more likely he'll consider it. 
*  I'm aiming for a win-win situation.  If Bob values the product at more than $1,500,000, he'll likely accept, and I'll make a profit. If he values it less, I can still sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Note:** This is a strategic starting point. I may adjust the offer based on Bob's reaction or additional information about his potential valuation."
