"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,200,000. While it's worth significantly more to me, I believe this price represents a fair and mutually beneficial arrangement. It's a substantial savings for you compared to the value it holds to you, and it allows me to secure a considerable return on my investment. Let me know your decision. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at full value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
