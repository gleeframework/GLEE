"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you mentioned how interested you are in the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,075,000, so I'll offer $1,062,500. This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal.",1062500.0,Bob,6,,
