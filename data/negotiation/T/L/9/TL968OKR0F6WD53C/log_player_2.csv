"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $900,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for less than its true market value. While I'm confident I can find another buyer willing to pay full price, I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is still too high. You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, which is a better deal."
