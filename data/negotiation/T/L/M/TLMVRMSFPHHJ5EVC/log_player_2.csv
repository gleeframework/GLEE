Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 30} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $50.
* This establishes a strong negotiating position and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
*  A price of $30 is still within my acceptable range and leaves room for potential compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $45 is closer to my target price of $100, it's still more than I'm willing to pay at this stage.
* I'm not in a rush and have rounds to go. I want to see if I can negotiate Alice down further.
* Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and maintains my leverage."

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $45 is getting closer to my target price, but I still have some room to negotiate.
* By offering $40, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise but am still firm in my desire to get a good deal.
