Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) but still lower than John's offer ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and makes me seem flexible.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, aiming to build rapport with Bob and make him feel like I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150).  
* **Proceed to the next round:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. It's possible we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  $125 is a bit too low for me right now, but I'm open to a compromise.  How about $140?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to work with him.
* **Message:**  I'm staying friendly and positive, reiterating my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us."
