"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. It offers unique capabilities that can greatly benefit your business, and I'm confident you'd see a significant return on investment. To move this forward, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This reflects my willingness to find common ground while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I agree there's a lot of value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
