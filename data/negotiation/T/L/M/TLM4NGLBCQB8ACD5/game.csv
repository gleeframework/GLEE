"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price closer to its true worth for me. How about $820000?",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $820000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly.  How about $880000? This allows you a significant saving, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a much better deal than selling to someone else.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I place on your product, I would like to propose a price of $850000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're seeking while still allowing me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  $850000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, but I'm still a bit short. How about we settle on $870000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let's make this deal happen!",870000.0,Alice,5,
