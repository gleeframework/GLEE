Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for both of you to compromise. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling to him:** A higher initial offer can make Bob feel like you're more likely to come to an agreement. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's reaction!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a little low, but it's still worth considering. Here's why I'm rejecting it and going for a counteroffer:

* **I can likely get more:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for a higher price than $10,500.
* **It's not a significant drop from my initial offer:**  $10,500 isn't much lower than my initial $11,500. This suggests that Bob might be willing to go up a bit.
* **Selling to John is a backup plan:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to be a bit more firm with Bob.

I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.** This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **It's still above my minimum.** I'm still making a profit, but I'm also leaving room for further negotiation.
* **It highlights the value for Bob.**  Reminding him that the product is worth more to him might encourage him to accept."
