{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $10,000 offer leaves space for a counteroffer from Bob without immediately resorting to John's offer.
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a ""great deal"" encourages Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is higher, but I can only pay up to $8000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it signals that he's willing to negotiate. This opens the possibility for a counteroffer that may be more favorable. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John is a guaranteed $12,000, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is just too low. The product is worth much more than that. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with reasoning:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but justifying my counteroffer with the value of the product. 
* **Reasonable compromise:** $9,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still keeps me above my minimum. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language like ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $8500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation window closing:** While Bob is increasing his offer, it's getting closer to my lower limit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John is a safe bet, but I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further. There's a risk that I might not get a better offer, but also a potential for a more favorable deal.
* **Next round counteroffer:** I'll try a final counteroffer closer to my minimum to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm really pushing my limits on this offer. Let's split the difference -  $9,250. This is a final offer from me, and it's a price I can't go lower on.  I think this is a fair deal, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept or walk away. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  $9,250 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, showing I'm willing to meet halfway. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I frame it as a fair deal to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise. 

**Key Consideration:** This is a high-risk, high-reward move.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to sell to John. However, if he accepts, I'll get a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your consideration. I've reviewed your latest offer and while it's closer to my budget, I still find it challenging to meet at $9250. I believe we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $9000. I hope this proposal is within your bounds and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  We've gone through several rounds of offers and counteroffers, and it seems unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and ensures I receive a decent profit. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale."
