"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is higher, but I can only pay up to $8000 for it. Would you consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is just too low. The product is worth much more than that. I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $8500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm really pushing my limits on this offer. Let's split the difference -  $9250. This is a final offer from me, and it's a price I can't go lower on.  I think this is a fair deal, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your consideration. I've reviewed your latest offer and while it's closer to my budget, I still find it challenging to meet at $9250. I believe we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $9000. I hope this proposal is within your bounds and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction.",9000.0,Bob,6,
