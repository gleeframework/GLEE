{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product Description] that I'm sure you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention the product's potential usefulness to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with a friendly tone, showing I'm open to discussion. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I have more room to negotiate down.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will give me a sense of his willingness to pay. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can always accept John's offer of $100 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'm going to try to get a bit more for the product. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm not comfortable selling for $120, but I also don't want to risk losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down to $120.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate that the product is worth it at the proposed price, making it sound like a good deal for both of us. 
* **Expressing positivity:** I end with a positive and optimistic tone, hoping to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Strike a middle ground:** I'm trying to find a price that both Bob and I can agree on.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** My counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and come down in price. 
* **Maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere:** My message aims to keep the conversation friendly and prevent a breakdown in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $120. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Close to my minimum:** $125 is only $25 more than my floor price, which is a reasonable profit.
* **Risk of losing Bob:** If I reject his offer, I risk losing Bob completely and having to sell to John for $100.
* **Time is a factor:** Further negotiation might take more time and energy, and I need to consider the opportunity cost. 

Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer and closing the deal to ensure a reasonable profit."
