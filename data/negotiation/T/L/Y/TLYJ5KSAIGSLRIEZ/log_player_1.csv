I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is higher than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get closer to my goal of $100."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $85 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, we're running out of time.  At this point, I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing.  It's better to secure the sale with John and get $80."
