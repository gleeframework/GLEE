Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows Alice to potentially maximize her profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The higher initial price provides a cushion for potential negotiation with Bob. If he counters, Alice can lower the price slightly and still make more than her minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 gives Alice a safety net. This knowledge allows her to confidently start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price point. 

**Important Note:**  While the offered price is $150, Alice should be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and potential negotiation."
