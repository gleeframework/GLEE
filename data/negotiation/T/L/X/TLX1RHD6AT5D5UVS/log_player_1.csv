"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, and also shows that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a drastic discount. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum price. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a good price for myself."
