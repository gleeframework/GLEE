"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential value. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if you're interested.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
