"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $13,500. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Alice's offer is overpriced. While she claims it's worth $15,000 to me, I'm willing to buy it from John for that price. There's a chance of getting a better deal by rejecting her offer."
