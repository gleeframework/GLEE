Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get close to my minimum price ($120), but I'm also prepared to accept $115 if necessary, as it's still better than selling to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm hoping to get closer to $120, and I'm confident I can do better than $105 in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still less than I'd get from someone else. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with an offer of $110. This gives him a slightly better price than my previous offer and leaves me some room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $107.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $120, Bob's offer of $107 is still lower than my minimum. At this point, I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach an agreement, and I'm better off selling the product to John for $120. It's a guaranteed sale and will meet my minimum price."
