Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start at his valuation. By starting at $120, we leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price higher than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest while justifying the price slightly by mentioning its worth to us. This approach sets the stage for potential counteroffers and a negotiation process. 
* **Alternative option (John):**  We always have John as a backup who's willing to pay $100. This knowledge gives us leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still below our minimum acceptable price ($100) and significantly lower than our initial offer.  We need to signal that we're serious about a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows us to counter and hopefully meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $105? That's a significant discount from my initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:** We came down from $120 to $105, showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying above our minimum. 
* **Highlighting the discount:** By framing the counteroffer as a ""significant discount,"" we aim to make it more appealing to Bob and potentially sway his decision.
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us in a strong position. If Bob accepts, we make a profit. If he rejects and offers closer to $100, we can accept. If he's unwilling to budge, we can always fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still not reaching our minimum acceptable price of $100.  It seems unlikely he'll go beyond $95, and we risk losing John's guaranteed offer if we continue negotiating with Bob. Selling to John ensures we get our minimum acceptable price without further risk."
