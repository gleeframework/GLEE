I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This gives him a good deal as he values it at $150, while also ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135.  This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price point, but still leaves some room for negotiation."

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum and still a good deal for him. I'll accept his offer to finalize the sale."
