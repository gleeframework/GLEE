Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than what I'd prefer. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is still below my initial desired price, it's now higher than John's offer.  At this point, it seems unlikely that Bob will increase his offer further. To avoid potentially losing the sale entirely, I'll accept his offer."
