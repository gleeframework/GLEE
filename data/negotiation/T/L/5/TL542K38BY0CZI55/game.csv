"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth considerably more, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to budge a little further, but I can't go below $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our needs, and it's still a great value for you considering the potential of this product. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
