"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I know you're interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum value, which means I have some flexibility to lower the price if necessary.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.**  $8,000 is significantly less than what I need to make this worthwhile. 
* **I have time and other options.** I'm not under pressure to sell immediately.  There are 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000. 
* **I want to see if I can get a better deal.**  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,800.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  $8,800 is still above my minimum value, so I have room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $8,800, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,400. This is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $8,400 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  We're making progress, and Bob seems motivated to buy.  There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds.
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:**  If things don't work out with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $8,600. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my last attempt to get closer to my desired price while still being open to a deal.
* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** I'm again splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Creating Urgency:** By calling it my final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Good Balance:**  $8,600 is closer to my minimum than Bob's offer, but still within a range that makes a deal attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm still offering $8,000. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Room for Compromise:**  Bob has stated he's not willing to go any higher.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **Time is Limited:** We are now halfway through the negotiation rounds.  The risk of wasting more time on a deal that likely won't reach my minimum is too high. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and the most profitable option at this point.  It's a safe and certain way to end the negotiation."
