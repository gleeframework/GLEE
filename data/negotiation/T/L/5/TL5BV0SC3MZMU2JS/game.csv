"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll get a good price for it. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I can only consider a price up to $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still leave us both with a profitable deal.  Let's see if we can make this work!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
