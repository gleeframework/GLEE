"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to meet me. However, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that the product is worth $9,000 to me, considering its value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at that price. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,800 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its value to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,6,
