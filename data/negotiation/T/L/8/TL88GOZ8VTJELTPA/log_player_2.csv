"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $60 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still a reasonable price for Bob, given his $100 budget. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still not a great deal.  Bob is willing to continue negotiating, hoping for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer, hoping to meet Alice halfway.  $65 is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still pushing for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price. While it's not the best possible deal, it's a good compromise, and with only 5 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating.  There's a chance Alice might become less willing to compromise, and buying from John for $100 might be the only option left. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
