"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a very attractive price. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Buying from Alice at $1,200,000 saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $1,200,000, you're buying the product for less than your estimated value of $1,500,000. This means you'll still make a profit."
