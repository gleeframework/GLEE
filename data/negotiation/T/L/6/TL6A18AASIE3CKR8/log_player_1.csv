I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a price that Bob might be willing to pay, considering his value is $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it still leaves me with a profit margin while hopefully being more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and significantly better than selling to John. I'm also not sure if I can get a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing this sale."
