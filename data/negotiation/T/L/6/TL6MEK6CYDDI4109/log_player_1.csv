Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it's worth more than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), suggesting Alice is willing to discuss the price further if Bob isn't immediately convinced.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a fair deal if he accepts the initial offer.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the security of John's $12,000 offer."
