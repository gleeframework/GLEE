"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $8,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
