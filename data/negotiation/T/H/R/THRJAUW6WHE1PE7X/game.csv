"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be happy to pay $120 for this product.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $135. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",135.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, so think carefully!",140.0,Alice,5,
