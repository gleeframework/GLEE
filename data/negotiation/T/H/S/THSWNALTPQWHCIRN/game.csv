"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is the highest you're willing to go, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to make the sale worthwhile for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.
