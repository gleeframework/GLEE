"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering its value to you as well. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
