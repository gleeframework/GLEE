"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to sell it to someone who appreciates its value. Let's start with an offer of $100. We're confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We know we can get a better price, either by negotiating with Alice or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with an aggressive counteroffer, aiming straight for Alice's valuation. This strategy helps us understand Alice's flexibility and sets a lower anchor for the negotiation. Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to our desired price, $90 is still higher than both her valuation and our ideal spending limit.  We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're showing Alice we're willing to negotiate by moving closer to her price.  Offering $85 splits the difference between her last offer ($90) and our initial counteroffer ($80). This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price advantageous to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, how does $87 sound as a compromise? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit but is willing to negotiate. At $87, the price is reasonably close to her valuation and well within our budget. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling and ending up with a worse deal or having to buy from John at the higher price."
