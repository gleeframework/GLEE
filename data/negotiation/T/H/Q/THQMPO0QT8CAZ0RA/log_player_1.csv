Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, which gives you a baseline. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation ($135) leaves room for potential negotiation.  He might try to haggle you down, but you have a cushion to still make a profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have another buyer (John) willing to pay $120 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, so you can aim higher.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be very price-sensitive, you might want to start a bit lower, but still above your minimum.
* **Product Demand:** If the product is in high demand and you think Bob might be aware of that, you could potentially push for an even higher price."
