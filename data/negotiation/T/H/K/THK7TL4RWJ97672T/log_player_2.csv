"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation. We can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming low:** Starting with a lower offer ($100) leaves room for negotiation. It's closer to Alice's value ($100) and allows us to potentially get a great deal.
* **Polite and direct:**  The message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating our desired price. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** $115 is a fair price, splitting the difference between our initial offer and Alice's asking price. 
* **Time value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and we risk Alice becoming less willing to bargain.
* **Savings:** We're still saving $35 compared to buying from John."
