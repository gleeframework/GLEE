Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) to make it enticing but still leave room for negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I can get $150 from John gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in further conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, even though it's closer.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $150 gives me the flexibility to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $135 is a middle ground between my initial offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130.  
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""good deal"" for both of us, which can be persuasive in a negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While this is a lower price than my initial offer, I'm still above Bob's perceived value.  This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate, but not at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to meet you at $132.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $132.50 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below that threshold.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my desired profit and saves time and effort. 

John is a guaranteed buyer at a price I'm happy with, so there's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob."
