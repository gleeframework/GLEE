{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer, while also giving Bob a reason to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I need to aim for a price closer to my minimum of $150.  I'll counter with a price that's still within Bob's perceived value but closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $137.50. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $137.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'll reject his offer and try to push him closer to my minimum with another counteroffer.  It's important to remember that I can still sell the product to John for $150, so I'm not under too much pressure to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
