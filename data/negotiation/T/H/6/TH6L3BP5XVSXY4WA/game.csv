"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1400000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you and allows for a comfortable profit margin.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your position, $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1350000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. How about $1275000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still a little hesitant at $1275000. It's getting closer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  Let's split the difference one more time. How about $1312500?  This is a final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close. I see your commitment to this deal, but $1256000 is still too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1294000.  This offer is very close to your last one, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1294000.0,Alice,7,
