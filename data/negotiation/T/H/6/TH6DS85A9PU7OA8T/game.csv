I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,6,
