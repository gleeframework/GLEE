"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm confident that you value this product highly, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the sale done. Let's aim for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,5,
