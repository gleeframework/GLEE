"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $850,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, it's important to start the negotiation with a number that heavily favors me. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counter-offer will reveal how attached Alice is to her initial price and how willing she is to negotiate.
* **Backup Option:** I always have the option to go to John for $1,500,000, so there's less pressure to settle quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice met me halfway, which indicates she's willing to negotiate. There's a good chance she might go lower. 
* **Target Price:** My goal is to get the price as close to $800,000 as possible (her value, not mine).  
* **John as Leverage:** I can always go to John if the negotiations stall or Alice won't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $925,000?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:**  I've made another significant concession ($125,000), but I'm still aiming for a price well below her current offer. This signals I'm serious about buying but need her to move closer to my range.
* **Staying Firm:** By staying above $900,000, I'm indicating that I'm not going to drastically reduce my offer every round. This encourages Alice to take my counteroffers more seriously.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I haven't explicitly mentioned it, the fact that I keep making counteroffers implies that I'm actively looking for the best deal.  This subtle pressure might encourage Alice to make a move toward a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm confident that you value this product highly, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the sale done. Let's aim for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $950,000 is a reasonable price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, especially since she's aware of my $1,500,000 backup option.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to push for a slightly lower price (e.g., $925,000) risks Alice walking away or prolonging the negotiation, which could cost me more in the long run. 
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now allows me to acquire the product and potentially start using it or benefiting from it sooner."
