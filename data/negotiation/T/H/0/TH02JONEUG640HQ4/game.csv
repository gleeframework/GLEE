"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still confident in its value. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great compromise.",725000.0,Alice,3,
