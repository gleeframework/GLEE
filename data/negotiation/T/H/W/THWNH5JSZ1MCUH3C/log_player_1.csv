Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. I'm open to negotiating but I won't go lower than $150 since that's my minimum value for the product. If Bob rejects, I'll see what kind of counteroffer he makes and decide whether to negotiate further or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than $150, I think I can get closer to my initial asking price of $200.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $190.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be agreeable to Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $175 is a good price and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's better than selling to John for $150, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
