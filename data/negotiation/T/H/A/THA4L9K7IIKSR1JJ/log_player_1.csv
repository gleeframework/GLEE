Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A slightly lower offer ($1,100,000) provides a buffer for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasize the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and return on investment.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 gives Alice leverage. She can afford to be assertive in her negotiation with Bob."
