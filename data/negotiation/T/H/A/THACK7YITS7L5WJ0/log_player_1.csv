"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2,200,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high initial offer ($2,200,000) sets a strong anchor. This might influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make your subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Using language that emphasizes the product's value and your confidence in the deal encourages Bob to take the offer seriously.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price provides ample room for negotiation, allowing you to strategically lower the price in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both your minimum and John's offer.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Continue Negotiation:** You have ample rounds left to try and bridge the gap.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Accepting this early offer might signal desperation and limit your ability to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider a revised price of $1,700,000. This offer reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Moving almost halfway towards Bob's offer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. This can encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Value:** The $1,700,000 price point keeps the offer significantly above both Bob's initial offer and John's guaranteed price, ensuring you're still aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing ""mutual benefit"" and ""commitment"" reinforces the collaborative nature of the negotiation and encourages a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,600,000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. I believe this could be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close, but Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and try to nudge Bob closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,675,000. This final offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1675000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** A smaller concession ($25,000) signals that we're nearing our bottom line while still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Finality:** Presenting this as a ""final offer"" adds weight and encourages Bob to seriously consider it as the best possible outcome.
* **Above John's Offer:**  Importantly, we are still aiming for a price higher than John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach an agreement, Alice. Considering the discussions we've had, I would like to submit a counteroffer of $1,650,000. This price still allows me to remain within my budget while recognizing the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is now a significant $150,000 above John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate for smaller gains might irritate Bob and risk the deal entirely. 
* **Time Value:** Securing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows you to move forward. 

While we could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's offer isn't worth the potential reward at this point.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a very favorable outcome."
