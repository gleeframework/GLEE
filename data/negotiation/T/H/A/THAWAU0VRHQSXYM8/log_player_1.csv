Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower.  
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. While Bob might not accept it outright, it gives you room to negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to the higher price. 

**Important Note:**  While you aim for the highest price, be prepared to potentially negotiate slightly if Bob shows resistance. You can always adjust your offer in a follow-up message if needed."
