"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $10,750? I think this is a fair compromise and lets us both get what we want.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,750 is close, but I need to get at least $10,900 for this to make sense for me.  Do you think we can make that work?",10900.0,Alice,5,
