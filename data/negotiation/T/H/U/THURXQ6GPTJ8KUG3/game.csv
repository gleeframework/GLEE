"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer, but $7,500 is still a little bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,000 even? That would make this a great deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $7,200, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7200.0,Alice,5,
