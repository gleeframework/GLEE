"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
    ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?"",
    ""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but $7,500 is still above our ideal price from John. We have room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
    ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer, but $7,500 is still a little bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,000 even? That would make this a great deal for both of us."",
    ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're inching closer to Alice's price, signaling that we're willing to compromise. Offering $7,000 keeps us below our maximum while aiming for a price that might be tempting for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $7,200, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $7,200, which is a reasonable compromise. While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and we risk losing the deal. Accepting at $7,200 secures the product at a price significantly lower than her initial offer and slightly below John's offer."
