"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You'll get a fantastic product at a price that's significantly lower than its true value to me. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. However, I do have another buyer who's ready to purchase it for $1,200,000. So, this offer is only valid for a limited time.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and make you think you're getting a bargain. Her mention of another buyer at a higher price is likely a negotiation tactic.
* **Your Best Alternative:** You know John will sell you the product for $800,000. This is your fallback option and sets a clear limit on what you should pay.
* **Potential Savings:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you could potentially save $200,000 ($1,000,000 - $800,000).

**Strategy:**  By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're not willing to overpay. She might come back with a lower offer closer to your acceptable range. If not, you can always buy from John."
