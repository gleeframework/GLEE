You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it makes sense to accept the offer. There's no advantage in rejecting it and going to John, as the price would be the same."
