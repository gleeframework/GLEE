"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which I think is a fair and reasonable price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $12000 at this time. This is my maximum price point.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is my best price for now.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $16000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $14000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $14000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $17000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",17000.0,Alice,5,
