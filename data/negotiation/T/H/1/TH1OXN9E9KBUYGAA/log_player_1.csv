"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible outcome.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to start with a price that gives me a significant profit, but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000.  It's not worth it to accept this low offer.  I'll reject and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a decent profit. $1,200,000 is a significant amount, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  I'm still leaving some room for negotiation in case I need to make further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can push him a little higher.  I think there's still some room to maneuver before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit.  $1,100,000 is a fair price, and I'm hoping that Bob will realize that he's close to getting a good deal.  If he rejects again, I'll have to start considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call.  While I could potentially get a little more if I keep negotiating, Bob's offer is finally at my minimum value.  It's getting late in the game, and I risk losing the deal if I keep rejecting offers. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my desired price and don't have to risk selling to John for the same amount.  I'm happy with this outcome."
