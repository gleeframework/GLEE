{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential for a good deal.  
* **Backup plan:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  There's a chance we can reach a compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get a better price. 

I'll counteroffer Bob and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I can't go as low as $900,000, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer rationale:**  My counteroffer is $1,100,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, giving me a much better profit than $900,000, but still a good deal for Bob compared to his perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but emphasize the benefits of the offer and the possibility of a successful deal.

I'm confident this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and move us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1100000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1050000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,050,000 is closer to my acceptable price, but it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Bob is showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, which suggests there might be room for a more agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep control of the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. 

I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer rationale:** My counteroffer is $1,150,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, bringing the price closer to my minimum while still being a good deal for Bob compared to his perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Message:** I continue to acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while highlighting the benefits of the offer for both parties, emphasizing the possibility of a mutually beneficial agreement.

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while keeping the negotiation moving forward.  I'm hoping this will be the final step before reaching a successful agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1150000, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need you to meet me halfway. Can you consider $1075000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,075,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even with a counteroffer, there's a strong chance we won't be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** The negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and there's a risk of getting bogged down in a drawn-out process.
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. This is the most financially secure option at this point.

It's better to end the negotiation with Bob and move forward with the guaranteed deal with John."
