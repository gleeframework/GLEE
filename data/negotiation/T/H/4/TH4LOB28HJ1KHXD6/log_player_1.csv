"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the benefit to Bob (""great deal"") to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left the door open for further negotiation by asking for his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate for a sale and I'm confident in the value of the product. This could incentivize Bob to increase his offer in the next round. 
* **Avoiding the ""Safe"" Option:** While selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. There's still a chance for me to earn more, and the negotiation process has only just begun."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($12,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($10,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and move towards an agreement. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to both of us, subtly reinforcing the fact that $11,500 is a fair price.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency with ""Let's close this deal."" This subtly encourages Bob to accept the offer before he potentially loses out."
