"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible. He's starting with a counteroffer that's $1,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that he's serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob.  While I appreciate your offer, $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is closer to his target, he can likely get it lower. Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer again and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $13,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price slightly lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise but still wants to get a good deal. He's also trying to be reasonable by pointing out that the price is fair for both of them."
