"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that leaves room for both of us to benefit.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
