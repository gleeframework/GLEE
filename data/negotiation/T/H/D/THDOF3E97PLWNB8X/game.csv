"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $12250?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
