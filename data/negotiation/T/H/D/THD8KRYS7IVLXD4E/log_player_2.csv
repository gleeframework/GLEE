"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm aware of its potential worth to you and am offering it to you at a price that allows for a significant return on your investment.  The price is $1,150,000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. However, you know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get closer to John's price by rejecting her initial offer."
