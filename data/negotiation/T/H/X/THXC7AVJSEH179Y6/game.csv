"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value our potential partnership, I can't go as low as $1,200,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,300,000. This allows for a significant profit for you, and still provides me with a fair return on my investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $1,250,000? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,250,000 is still a bit below my minimum. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1,275,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit margin for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've considered your latest offer carefully. I'm willing to move closer to your price point. Could we agree on $1,260,000 for the product? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise for both parties involved.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
