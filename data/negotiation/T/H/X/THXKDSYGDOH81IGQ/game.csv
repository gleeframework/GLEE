"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for this product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $14,000 is still too expensive for my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. However, I'm afraid $12,500 is still pushing my budget.  Could you meet me at $10,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,6,
