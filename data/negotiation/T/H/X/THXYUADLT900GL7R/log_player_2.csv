"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. This unique item holds significant value to us, but considering its importance to you, we aim to find a fair price. We are offering the product to you for $2,000,000. We believe this price reflects not only the product's worth but also the opportunity it presents for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $2,000,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
