"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1150000 for the product.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
