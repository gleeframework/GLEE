"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still feeling a bit high at $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a compromise, but I think it's a good middle ground.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this. I'm willing to go up to $11,100. This is very close to your last offer, and I believe it would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",11100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,250 and $11,100. How about we go with $11,175? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",11175.0,Alice,7,
