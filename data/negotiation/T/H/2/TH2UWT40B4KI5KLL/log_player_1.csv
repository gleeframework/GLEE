"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can come to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to take the $11,000 than to risk losing both Bob and John and ending up with nothing."
