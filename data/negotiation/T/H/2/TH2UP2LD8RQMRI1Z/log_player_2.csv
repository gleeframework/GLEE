"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point.  There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting the offer and trying to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair offer, considering the product's value to me and my budget limitations. I'm confident we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1075000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $1090000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price point, but it's still above his budget. There's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000. It's worth trying to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  However, $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to me and my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1060000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I propose a price of $1075000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. It saves him money and avoids further negotiation with Alice, where the price might not drop any further."
