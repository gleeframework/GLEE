"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer it to you for $8800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,5,
