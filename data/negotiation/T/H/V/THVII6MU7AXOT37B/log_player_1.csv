Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in great condition and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but not too high that it scares Bob off right away. It's important to leave room for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but he's shown interest. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $7,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price of $8,000. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $7,800? That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $7,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $7,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we're running out of rounds. While I'd like to get more, it's becoming clear that Bob and I aren't going to agree on a price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000."
