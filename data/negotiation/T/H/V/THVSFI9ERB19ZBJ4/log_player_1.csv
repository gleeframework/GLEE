``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential concessions. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm providing a reason for the price, emphasizing its potential value for Bob's business. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive and leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Reserve:** I'm aware of John's offer and will use it as a safety net if Bob's counteroffers become too low."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Bob's offer is still too low.
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if I can get Bob to come up closer to my target price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is appealing, I still have a chance to get a better deal with Bob. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  By rejecting the offer, I'm taking a calculated risk, but I believe the potential rewards outweigh the risk of losing the deal to John.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price.

```
