Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I recognize the value of the product,  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This price would allow me to make a worthwhile investment and hopefully, we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
