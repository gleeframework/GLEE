Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, my goal is to maximize profit. Bob is willing to pay more, so I need to aim higher.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum but still leaving Bob with a potential profit margin ($1,500,000 - $1,300,000 = $200,000). 
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By making the first offer, I set the anchor for the negotiation. Bob is more likely to counter within a reasonable range of my initial price.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
