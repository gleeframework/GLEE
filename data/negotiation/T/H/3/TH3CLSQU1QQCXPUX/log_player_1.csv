"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my initial asking price. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's significant value and exceeding your minimum acceptable price, you signal confidence and potentially anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Open to Discussion:**  While starting high, it's crucial to remain approachable and express willingness to negotiate. This prevents alienating Bob early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is quite good, it's still significantly below my initial ask.  I want to see if I can negotiate him a bit higher before settling. There's still plenty of room for negotiation before I need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, I'm still confident the true value of this product is higher.  Would you be willing to consider $1,950,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I believe this price point better reflects the long-term benefits this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm coming down slightly from my initial ask to show a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value again to justify the higher price. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,900,000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my desired price point, and $1,900,000 is a very strong offer. While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation, the difference is likely to be minimal. Accepting now secures a great price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation dragging on."
