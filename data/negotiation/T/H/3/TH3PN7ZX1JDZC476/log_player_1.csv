Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Targeting above Bob's perceived value:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as rare, high-quality, or urgently needed.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high price doesn't mean it's final. It opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, giving you a better understanding of his true willingness to pay.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to ensure a sale, a price closer to $10,000 would be a safer bet."
