"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you want to get a good price, and I'm happy to pay a fair amount. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
