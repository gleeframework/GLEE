"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's value of $15,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!
