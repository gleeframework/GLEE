Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value. How about we settle around $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate but I won't settle for such a drastic drop in price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is coming closer to my minimum price, $1,200,000 is still below my acceptable range.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000. This is a fair price that balances your needs with the product's worth. Consider this my final offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we can both agree on. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,250,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower. I've reached my limit with Bob and I need to ensure I secure a price that reflects the true value of the product.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 is the best option at this point."
