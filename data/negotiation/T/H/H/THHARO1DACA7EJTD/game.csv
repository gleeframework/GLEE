"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a valuable asset that will be a great addition to your business. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value. How about we settle around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's true value and gives you a fair deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000. This is a fair price that balances your needs with the product's worth. Consider this my final offer. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we can both agree on. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,250,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
