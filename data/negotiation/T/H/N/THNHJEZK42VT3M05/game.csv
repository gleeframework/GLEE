"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $17,000 is lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $17,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",16750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on this.  While I want to find a price that works for both of us, I can't go lower than $18,000.  This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,750 and $18,000, which would be $17,375. I think this is a fair compromise. Can you consider this offer?",17375.0,Bob,6,
