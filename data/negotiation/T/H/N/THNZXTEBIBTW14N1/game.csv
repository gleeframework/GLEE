"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we can both be happy.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
