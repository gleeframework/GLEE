"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe is truly exceptional. Given its quality and unique features, I think it's worth more than its face value of $150. Considering its rarity and the benefits it offers, I would like to propose an offer of $200 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations and we can make this transaction happen.",200.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $200. I'm willing to pay $175 for the product, considering its quality and features. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",175.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $185 for the product. This takes into account both the quality and the features of the item, while also being slightly more reasonable than my initial offer. I hope this proposal is agreeable and we can reach a satisfactory agreement.",185.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable paying $185, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $180 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",180.0,Bob,4,
