"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is negotiable:** She's clearly trying to anchor you at a high price by claiming it's worth $12,000 to you. You know your upper limit is $12,000 and her lower limit is likely closer to $8,000. 
* **You have a backup plan:** John provides a safety net. You won't be left without the product if you reject Alice's offer.
* **Potential for savings:** By rejecting her initial offer, you open the door for negotiation and the potential to buy the product for significantly less than $10,000."
