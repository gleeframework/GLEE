"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially save a significant amount of money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 is below its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum price point of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us. Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to make another counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
