{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly higher than what I know Bob values it at ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message doesn't explicitly state this is my ""final"" price, leaving the door open for counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to see if I can get Bob to accept a price closer to my desired value. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $100 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Counter-negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, he's expressed interest in the product. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counter with a price higher than $70, but still lower than my initial offer of $110.  This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my interests. 
* **Assess Bob's Response:**  I'll pay close attention to how Bob responds to my counteroffer to gauge his willingness to compromise.
* **Keep John as an option:**  If the negotiations fail, I'm prepared to sell to John for $100 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial $110 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Reinforce Value:**  The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob by highlighting that it's still a good deal for him.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further discussion, avoiding a hard ""take it or leave it"" approach.

**Strategy:**

* **Gauge Bob's Response:**  I'm observing whether Bob is willing to meet me halfway or if he's sticking to his $70 offer. 
* **Final Offer:**  If Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer, I might be willing to drop to $85 but likely won't go lower. 
* **John as Backup:**  If negotiations fail, I'll still have the option of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the point where I'm considering buying from John, but I'd still like to try to get a good deal from you. How about $85? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of Losing Sale:** If I reject his offer, there's a good chance he'll buy from John, leaving me with nothing.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though this is a slightly lower price than I initially hoped for, it's still a profitable sale. I might be able to build a relationship with Bob for future purchases where I can potentially secure a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting the Offer:**  I'm willing to take a small loss in this instance to avoid completely losing the sale and to potentially establish a future relationship with Bob.
* **John as a Backup:**  While I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'll keep John in mind as a potential buyer for future products."
