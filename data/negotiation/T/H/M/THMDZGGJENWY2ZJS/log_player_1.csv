{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal for myself. If he rejects it, I'll be ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $85 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $82.50 is a good compromise, and it's above my minimum price of $80.  I'm happy to close the deal."
