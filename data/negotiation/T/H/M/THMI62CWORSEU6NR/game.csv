"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm asking for $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit to that price.  I'm very interested in the product but I need to be sure I'm getting the best value.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $750000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",815000.0,Alice,5,
