"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Let's negotiate! Alice's first offer is quite high considering her product's worth to her.  We should counter with a much lower price to start."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $850,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a good deal. We'll counter again to signal we're willing to negotiate, but we're not going to drastically increase our offer just yet."

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price we can work with, but we're still aiming for under $700,000 if possible. We'll continue to negotiate in smaller increments."

It seems Alice has reached her limit, and $700,000 is a reasonable price, saving us a significant amount compared to John's offer. Let's take it!"
