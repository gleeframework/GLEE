"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your new offer, so I'll counter with $11250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'll counter with $13000. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle soon.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'll counter with $12500. Can we meet in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make one more counteroffer, and it's $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'll make one last attempt to negotiate. I'll counter with $13000. Can you reconsider?",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made it clear that $13500 is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid we've reached an impasse. I'm going to have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,9,
