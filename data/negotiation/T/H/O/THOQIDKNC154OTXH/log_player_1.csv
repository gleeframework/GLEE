"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll gauge Bob's interest based on his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I believe this offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price further, but I'm still aiming for a good profit. This offer is a significant discount from my initial offer and might be more appealing to Bob. I'll see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing out completely. Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit and avoids any further risk of Bob rejecting my future offers."
