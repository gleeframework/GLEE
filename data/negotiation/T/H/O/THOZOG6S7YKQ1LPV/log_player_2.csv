"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can strike a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he knows he can get it for $8,000 from John.  He has room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer,  let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While $10,500 is better than $12,000, it's still above his ideal price point of $8,000.  He has more room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering both our positions. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,500 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This price recognizes both our positions and allows us to move forward. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

Alice is offering $10,000, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  While there's some potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers is high, and Bob is running out of rounds.  It's more prudent for him to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
