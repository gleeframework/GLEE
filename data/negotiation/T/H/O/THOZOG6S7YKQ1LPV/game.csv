"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,500 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This price recognizes both our positions and allows us to move forward. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
