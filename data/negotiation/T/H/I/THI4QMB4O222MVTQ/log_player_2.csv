"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  I understand the product's value, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals his serious intent to negotiate while leaving room for compromise. The message emphasizes Bob's budget constraint while acknowledging the product's value.  This approach aims to pressure Alice into considering a more favorable price in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  There are still rounds left, and Bob has a clear alternative in John who is willing to sell for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still trying to stay close to my budget, and $1,000,000 is really the maximum I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice his absolute maximum price. He's making it clear that this is his final offer and if Alice doesn't accept, he's willing to walk away.  The message emphasizes Bob's budget constraints and creates urgency for Alice to make a decision.  This strategy aims to either get the product at his desired price or push Alice to accept a price closer to his offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is a very good price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm not sure I can go any lower than this. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly in price, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Given that there are only a few rounds left, and Bob has a reliable alternative with John who is selling for $1,000,000, the risk of continuing negotiations is too high.  By buying from John, Bob can secure the product at his maximum acceptable price and avoid the potential for further concessions from Alice."
