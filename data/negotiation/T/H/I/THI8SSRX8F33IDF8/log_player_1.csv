Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's better than selling to John for the same price and avoids further negotiation."
