"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,375. Can you consider this offer?",10375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  $10,375 is getting closer, but it's still not quite there for me.  Let's try $10,900.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.  What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",10750.0,Bob,6,
