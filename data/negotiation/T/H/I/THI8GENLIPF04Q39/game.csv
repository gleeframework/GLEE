"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a good price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $8200. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $8200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8100. I think that's a fair price for the product.",8100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8100 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still looking to get as much as I can for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $8150. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8150.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $8100 is as high as you're willing to go, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $8120. That's my final offer.",8120.0,Alice,7,
