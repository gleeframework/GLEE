{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a relatively high price, but it's still below what the product is worth to Bob. It also emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more appealing.  This strategy aims to get a good starting point in the negotiation while leaving room for potential counteroffers and adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about $110? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is less than our initial goal, it's still a decent profit and better than selling to John for $80. Since Bob is clearly hesitant to go higher, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and finalize the sale."
