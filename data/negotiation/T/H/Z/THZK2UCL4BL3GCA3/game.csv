"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1800000 is way above my budget.  Given its potential, I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it right now. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which reflects the value I see in the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1200000. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $1300000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer you $1250000, and I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
