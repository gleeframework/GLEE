Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
