"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price,  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could you consider $13,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting.",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $14,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping you can see that I'm serious about making a deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
