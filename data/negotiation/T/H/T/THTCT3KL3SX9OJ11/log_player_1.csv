"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is optimistic and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $18,000 is a good starting point for negotiation. It allows for potential compromise to a price within my minimum acceptable range ($15,000) without seeming unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** Selling for $8,000 would be a huge loss for me.
* **I have multiple rounds to negotiate.** There's no reason to accept this offer when I can likely get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000.** While that's an option, I'm confident I can reach a better deal with Bob within the remaining rounds. 

I will counteroffer Bob to keep the negotiation going and try to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's try to find common ground. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price but remaining above my minimum threshold. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and focused on finding a solution. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** $13,000 allows for further negotiation, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have more rounds left and can likely get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is still an option:**  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob to keep the negotiation going and try to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and makes it seem like a fair solution.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using language like ""good deal"" and ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer.
* **Closing the Gap:**  $12,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I'm continuing the negotiation by presenting a clear counteroffer, keeping the conversation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $10,000.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I might have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While he's reached his absolute limit, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is running out.** I have only 4 rounds left. While I want to reach a deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. 
* **John's offer is still a guaranteed deal.** Selling to John would give me my minimum desired price and is a less risky option at this point.

I will counteroffer Bob one last time to try to reach a compromise. If he rejects, I will sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my last attempt to get a better price from Bob, acknowledging his constraints. $11,500 is a compromise but is still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Clear and Final:**  This is presented as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob rejects, I'm ready to accept John's offer to guarantee my minimum profit."
