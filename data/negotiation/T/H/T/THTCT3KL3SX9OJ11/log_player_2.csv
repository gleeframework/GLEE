"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is way above my budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price can help gauge her flexibility. By offering $8,000, I'm aiming to establish a starting point for negotiation that is significantly closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's try to find common ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $13,000 is still too high. I'll keep negotiating, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by dropping her price significantly.  Offering $10,500 splits the difference between her current offer ($13,000) and my previous offer ($8,000). This shows her I'm willing to move towards her price, but I still need her to come down further to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice is suggesting a compromise, $12,250 is still significantly more than I want to spend. I need to push her closer to my $10,000 limit, or seriously consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $10,000.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Direct and Firm:**  It's time to be direct about my budget limitations. This leaves no ambiguity about my price ceiling.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice about John's offer without explicitly walking away from the negotiation yet.
* **Clear Call to Action:** I'm giving her a clear choice: either accept my final offer, or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is firm at $11,500, and I've been clear that my absolute maximum is $10,000.  
* **Final Offer:** She's stated this is her final offer, so further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.
* **John's Guarantee:**  I know John will sell me the product for $10,000. It's time to take the guaranteed savings and move on."
