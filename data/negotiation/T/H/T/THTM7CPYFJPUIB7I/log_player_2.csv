"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is above your maximum budget. While the product might be valuable, you have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to your $10,000 limit.  It's too early to buy from John at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer can help gauge her flexibility and establish your own position. 
*  $8,000 is a substantial drop from $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps the price well within your budget. 
*  A polite but direct message sets the tone for potentially tough but fair negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we discuss $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still above your target price and what John offers. You have room to negotiate, especially since you're still in the early rounds.  There's no need to jump to John just yet, as you might be able to secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling is $10,000.  Would you be willing to close the deal at that price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Honesty and Transparency:**  Telling Alice your true budget limit builds trust and potentially speeds up the negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:** You are holding firm at your maximum price while still acknowledging her willingness to negotiate.
* **Call to Action:**  Directly asking if she'll close the deal at $10,000 puts the ball in her court for a clear decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I've already made a concession to meet you halfway, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get a bit more out of the deal. How about we say $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly from her previous offer, and it's clear she's unlikely to meet your $10,000 limit. She views her previous concession as substantial, making further negotiation difficult. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, and it's better to take that rather than risk getting stuck in a stalemate with Alice or paying more than you need to."
