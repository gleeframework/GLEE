{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,000. It's still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable value and I'm running out of rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then having to sell to John for less than I initially hoped for."
