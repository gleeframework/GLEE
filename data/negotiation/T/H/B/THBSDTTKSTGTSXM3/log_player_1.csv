"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I want to maintain a friendly and open dialogue to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I highlight the ""great deal"" to emphasize the potential value for Bob. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also aware of the option of selling to John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for this product, considering its value. It's a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm still significantly above Bob's offer, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I continue to be friendly and encourage negotiation. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I frame the offer as a way to ""make this happen,"" implying a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $10,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  We have six rounds remaining, and there's still potential to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is always a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would be a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a clear willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing a deal:** I'm framing this offer as a way to ""close this deal,"" highlighting the potential for a positive outcome.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiations.
* **Still above my minimum:**  While $9,500 is lower than my desired price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I can always walk away and sell to John."
