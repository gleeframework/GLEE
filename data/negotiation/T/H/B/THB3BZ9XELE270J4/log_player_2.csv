"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  There's no need to rush into a decision. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm interested, I'm not quite ready to pay $12,000. I'm willing to offer $10,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering your value for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for a back-and-forth.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting that I'm considering both Alice's value and my own budget. 
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I end with a question to encourage further discussion and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $11000? This is a fair price considering the value you placed on the product and my minimum price. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,000.  This is progress, but I'm still aiming to get the price lower. There's still room for negotiation before I consider buying from John.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to find common ground.
* **Positive language:** I use phrases like ""appreciate your willingness"" and ""confident we can reach an agreement"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that the proposed price is fair to both of us, reinforcing the idea of a mutually beneficial deal."
