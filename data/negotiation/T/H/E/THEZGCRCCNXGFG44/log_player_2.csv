"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:**  Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing he's serious about getting a better deal. 
* **Realistic expectation:**  Bob's counteroffer is still above Alice's minimum value ($8,000), making it a potentially acceptable deal for her.
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:**  This counteroffer establishes a starting point for future rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While $14,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer of $13,000 is better than her initial $14,000, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but  $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.   How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Bob is proposing a price that's exactly in between his previous offer ($12,000) and Alice's latest offer ($13,000). This shows he's willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  The offer is still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000, making it potentially acceptable to her.
* **Building towards a deal:**  By making this counteroffer, Bob is moving closer to Alice's price while staying within his budget."
