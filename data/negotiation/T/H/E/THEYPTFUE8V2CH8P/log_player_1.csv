"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000, which is still less than the product's worth to me but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the value to Bob, using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""very valuable."" This encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a friendly question to keep the conversation open and show I'm willing to discuss further.

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of getting a good price while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's so far below my floor. 

By rejecting his offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a fair price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  However, I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open, as his offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $920,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see at least $940,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $930,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, especially with only four rounds left.

I'm also considering the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my full asking price. 

By rejecting this offer, I'm sending a clear signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting the price I need and that I'm not afraid to walk away."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $930,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $935,000.

It's time to make a decision â€“ either accept this offer, or we'll have to part ways."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last offer. I'm showing Bob that I'm serious and I'm not going to negotiate any further.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm only lowering the price by $5,000, which shows I'm still firm on my price but willing to compromise a bit more. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and how it will benefit his company.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by saying ""it's time to make a decision."" This might push Bob to accept my offer to avoid losing the opportunity.

With only three rounds left, I'm taking a more assertive approach.  I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $925,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

The risk of further negotiation is too high, as I could potentially end up with a price that is much lower than my minimum.

I've already shown a willingness to compromise, and it's clear that Bob is not going to meet my price point.  

Therefore, the best option is to sell the product to John, who is willing to pay my full asking price.  

This ensures that I get the best possible outcome and that I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
