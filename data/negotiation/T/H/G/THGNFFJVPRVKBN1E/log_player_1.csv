Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $18,000."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might miss out if he doesn't act now.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the price is above Bob's perceived value, it allows for him to counter-offer.  You can then negotiate down, potentially settling closer to his $12,000 valuation while still exceeding your minimum of $15,000.

**Important Note:** You have a strong fallback option with John. If Bob rejects your offer, you're not losing out. This allows you to be more firm in your negotiation with Bob."
