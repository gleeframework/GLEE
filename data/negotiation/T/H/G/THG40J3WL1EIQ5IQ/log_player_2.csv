"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $130 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
