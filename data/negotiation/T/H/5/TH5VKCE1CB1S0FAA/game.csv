"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make an offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $500,000. This would be a more comfortable entry point for me.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $700,000. This is a more reasonable compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell you're firm on the price, but I'd feel much better about closing the deal at $625,000.  Do you think we can make that work?",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $625,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $650,000 and $625,000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $637,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",637500.0,Alice,7,
