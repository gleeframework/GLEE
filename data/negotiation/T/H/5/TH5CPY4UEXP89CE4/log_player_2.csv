Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is getting close to my budget, I'm still hesitant to accept. I've already shown Alice that I'm willing to walk away, and I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $12,500, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,250. This is the last price I'm willing to consider. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,250 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While I've been pushing for a better deal, I've also been indicating my willingness to walk away. With only one round left, it's not worth risking the deal completely.  Buying the product from John for $10,000 guarantees I get what I want within my budget."
