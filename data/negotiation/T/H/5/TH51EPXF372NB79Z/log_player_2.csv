"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high, exceeding my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's significant room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and attempt to counter with a price closer to my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects its worth to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product represents a significant investment on my end. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,800,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still too high. While she is showing some flexibility, I need to keep pushing for a lower price. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you considering my position.  $1,800,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm firm on $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us both to walk away with a win. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
