Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a price of $14,000.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the security of John's offer ($15,000) if Bob rejects our proposal. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring we don't lose the sale entirely."
