It's not worth buying from Alice at $12,000 since you can get the same product from John for $8,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

I'm starting with a price close to what I'm willing to pay from John.  It's a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it might be appealing to her if she wants to get rid of the product."

Alice's offer is still too high. It's tempting to accept because it's better than John's offer, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price. I'll try another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to stay below my maximum.  It's a fair compromise that might get her to accept."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's better to go with John's offer and get the product for a guaranteed $8,000. Further negotiation with Alice risks increasing the price or ending up with no deal at all."
