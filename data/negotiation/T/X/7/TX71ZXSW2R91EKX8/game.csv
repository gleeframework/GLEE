"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a good compromise and allows you to make a profit.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  It's my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
