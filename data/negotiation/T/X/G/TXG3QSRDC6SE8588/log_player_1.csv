Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than what the product is worth to me, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay a premium for this product, and I'm confident I can secure a favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum threshold. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000, and it seems like negotiations are going nowhere. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is offering a fair price."
