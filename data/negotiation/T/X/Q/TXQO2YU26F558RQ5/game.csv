"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to me. Can you consider meeting me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price. Can you consider it?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still really interested in the product, but I have to be honest, I've already made an offer of $9000 and I'm not willing to go above that. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. Can you consider it?",9000.0,Bob,6,
