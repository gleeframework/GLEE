"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, considering you value it at $8,000 and I'm willing to pay up to $10,000.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That way we both get a fair price, and I can avoid having to sell to John.",9000.0,Alice,3,
