"I'm not sure I can go as high as $120, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $105?  That's still a good price for you, considering you value the product at $150.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable with $105. How about we try $95? That's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
