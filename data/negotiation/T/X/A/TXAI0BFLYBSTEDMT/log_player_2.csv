"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This item holds immense value to me, but I am confident it will serve you even better given its worth of $1500000 to you. I am offering this extraordinary piece to you at a price of $1200000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between the intrinsic value and my expectations.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I am more than happy to discuss any concerns or questions you might have regarding the product or the transaction.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice
