"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which reflects its value and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value and benefits it provides, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is his maximum budget, and while it matches your minimum acceptable price, you have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount. It makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
