"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $820,000 is below my acceptable threshold.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. How about we settle on $885,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.",885000.0,Alice,3,
