"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm starting at a price that reflects its worth to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This would allow us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $950000. This would be a significant saving for me, while still allowing you to make a profit.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1025000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us.

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975000. This is a fair price that gives us both a reasonable outcome.  Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Bob,6,
