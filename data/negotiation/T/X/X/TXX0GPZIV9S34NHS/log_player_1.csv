Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than your fallback option ($10,000 from John).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** Offering it at $14,000 shows you understand its value while still offering him a good deal compared to his perceived $15,000."
