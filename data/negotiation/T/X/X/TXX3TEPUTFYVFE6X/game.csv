"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $14000. How about we split the difference and meet at $16000? I'm confident this price still represents a good value for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,4,
