"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's less than my minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation to get a better deal from Bob. It's best to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $120."
