"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value.  This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. I'm confident I can secure a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's a step in the right direction.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident this counteroffer is fair and will entice Bob to come closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my target. I'm confident I can secure a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John.  I'll reject and try one more counteroffer before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll go ahead and sell to John."
