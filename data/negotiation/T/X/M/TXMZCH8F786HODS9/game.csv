"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $175, which is a great deal considering its value.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $160 for the product. Can you consider this price?",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see that you're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make another concession, and I can offer it to you for $180. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $165 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $165 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $185, which is the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",185.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your minimum price as possible, but I'm still not willing to go above $165. I'd like to reiterate that this is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",165.0,Bob,8,
