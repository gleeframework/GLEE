"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Opening with a high price sets a strong starting point for the negotiation and allows for more room to compromise. 
* **Expressing Value:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob can encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates willingness to discuss the price, suggesting a flexible approach. 

**Important Note:** This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing the deal.  It's a starting point, and I will adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's message indicates a willingness to negotiate, so I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 9 rounds remaining, giving me time to explore counteroffers. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $800,000, there's still potential to earn more with Bob, especially if he is truly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility and encourages further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to emphasize why this price is fair.
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  I frame the offer as a win-win situation, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:**  I'm aiming to find a balance between maximizing my profit and securing a deal with Bob. The remaining rounds will determine how much I'm willing to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and would hopefully be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Need to Risk:**  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is the same, so there's no advantage in selling to him.
* **Time is Limited:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's prudent to secure this deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
