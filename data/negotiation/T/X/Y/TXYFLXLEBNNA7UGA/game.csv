"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows me to achieve my financial goals, while giving you a significant deal. Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
