Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  It's important to remember that I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so this is a calculated risk. I'll be prepared to negotiate further based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum, but also shows I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a reasonable price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is consistently offering lower prices, and his latest offer is below my minimum.  It's clear we aren't going to reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than accepting Bob's offer and losing money."
