Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider acceptable. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a compromise."
