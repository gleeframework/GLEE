"Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $130 right now.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $130 is quite a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $145?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy now.",145.0,Bob,4,
