"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while still giving you a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,4,
