"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $8000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm feeling a bit more confident at $9500. If we can find a way to bridge the gap, I think we can finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still a little hesitant at $10500.  Would you consider $10200? This is my absolute limit, but I'm confident we can strike a deal at this price.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10200, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's usually worth $1000, absolutely free. This way, you'll get the product and the service package for the price of $10200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
