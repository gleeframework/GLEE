"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us and we could finalize the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
