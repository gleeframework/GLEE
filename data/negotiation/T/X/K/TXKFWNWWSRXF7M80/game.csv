"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $140 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. Would you be willing to accept $150? That would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
