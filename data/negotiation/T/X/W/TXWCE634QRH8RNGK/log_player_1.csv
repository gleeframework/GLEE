"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my minimum price as possible in the first round.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $150, I'm not afraid to be a bit aggressive in the initial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want to get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering a price that's just slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still within my acceptable range. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also pushing for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're now in Round 6 and Bob's offers haven't been increasing significantly enough. I'm confident I can get a better price by selling to John."
