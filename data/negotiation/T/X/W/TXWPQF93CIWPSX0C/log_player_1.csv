"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm leaving room for negotiation in case Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value the product holds for him, while also ensuring I earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $130, I'm running out of rounds and the risk of getting a worse offer or having to sell to John for $100 is too high. $125 is still a good deal for me, considering my minimum acceptable price is $100."
