"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to purchase it at the special introductory price of $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a decent discount from the $120 price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to spend closer to $105.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate you while still ensuring we receive a fair value for our product, I am willing to offer the premium product at $107. This price reflects the value we place on the product while also considering your offer. Would this be acceptable for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $107 is less than Bob's $120 limit.
* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's counteroffer:** It's only $2 more than Bob's desired $105. 
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the time:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away or reaching a stalemate.

While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is a good balance between getting a discount and avoiding further potential delays or complications."
