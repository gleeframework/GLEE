"Thanks for the offer Alice, $10,000 is a great starting point. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While we aim to accommodate all our customers, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer. Our current pricing strategy allows us to maintain the quality and integrity of our products. We are unable to match the $9,500 offer. However, I would like to extend a personal invitation for you to visit our showroom where you can experience the product firsthand and perhaps reconsider your offer. Looking forward to your positive response.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $10,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be a satisfied customer.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. In light of your latest offer, I am pleased to extend our previous offer to $9,900. This represents a slight adjustment that aims to find a mutually beneficial solution while maintaining the value and quality of our product. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",9900.0,Alice,5,
