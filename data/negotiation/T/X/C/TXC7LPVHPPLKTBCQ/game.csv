"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to what works for me. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
