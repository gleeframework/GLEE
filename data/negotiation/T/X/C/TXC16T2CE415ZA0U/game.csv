"I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, given the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
