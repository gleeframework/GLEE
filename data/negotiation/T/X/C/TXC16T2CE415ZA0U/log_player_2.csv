"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $12,000.**  This means you can potentially save money by negotiating.
* **John's offer provides a safety net.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a fallback option.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can explore a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, given the value I place on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000 less than her initial offer** and is now within your budget of $12,000.
* **This is a good deal for you.** It's cheaper than John's offer, and you've successfully negotiated a lower price.

While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you might end up paying John's price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product at a price that is within your budget and saves you money."
