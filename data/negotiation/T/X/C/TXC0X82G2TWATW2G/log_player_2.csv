"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How does $90 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90, which is a good deal, but you can still do better.  Since you know John will sell it to you for $100, you can reject Alice's offer and save $10."
