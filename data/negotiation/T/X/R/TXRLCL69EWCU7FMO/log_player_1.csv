"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm happy to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully entice Bob to accept the offer in the first round. If he rejects, I can then gradually increase the price in subsequent rounds while keeping an eye on the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is more than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $85 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $120. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $130 to $120. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also sets a firm lower limit that is still closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want $120, but I'm still capped at $85.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'm happy to purchase from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Even though I have more rounds left, I'm worried that if I continue negotiating with Bob, I might not be able to reach a deal that meets my minimum price.  Instead, I'll choose to sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
