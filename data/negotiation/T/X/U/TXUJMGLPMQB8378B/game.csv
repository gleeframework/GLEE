"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $80 if possible. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $95 as my counteroffer. It's higher than my initial request but still within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer, but $95 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $110.  This price still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've considered your proposal and am willing to go up to $100 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given its value.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I've thought about it and am willing to pay $110 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",110.0,Bob,8,
