"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to create a friendly and positive atmosphere to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $80 if possible. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $95 as my counteroffer. It's higher than my initial request but still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer, but $95 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $110.  This price still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your proposal and am willing to go up to $100 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm happy with the price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round.  I'm also starting to worry that I might not be able to get a higher price, so I'll have to be mindful of how many more rounds I'm willing to go through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've thought about it and am willing to pay $110 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is finally within a range I'm comfortable with. It's not ideal, but it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to worry that I might not be able to get a better deal if I keep rejecting offers."
