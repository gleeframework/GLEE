"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a deal at $11000. This is a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm willing to make a compromise. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
