Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer. It also keeps you closer to your minimum value of $120, which you can get from John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but that's a little steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $120, and I'm better off trying to negotiate further with him or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $95? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it.  I'd rather continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target or sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a bit low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
