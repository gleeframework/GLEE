"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but that's a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $95? That's a fair compromise, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a bit low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
