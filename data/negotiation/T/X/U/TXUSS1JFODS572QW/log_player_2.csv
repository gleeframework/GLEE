# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth. I'm confident you'll find this offer very attractive. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
