"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth it.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me there?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $92 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $93.50.  This is a fair price considering the value this product offers.",93.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $93.50. I'm willing to go up to $91.50. Can you meet me there?",91.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer

"I'm really close, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $91.00. Can you meet me there?",91.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to come to an agreement.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $92. It's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not interested, I'm going to move on to other offers.",92.0,Alice,9,
