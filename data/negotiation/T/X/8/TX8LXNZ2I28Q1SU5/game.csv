"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and the potential benefits it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. The product is worth much more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is a significant discount from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
