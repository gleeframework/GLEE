Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $100, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $125 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Creating a Sense of Value:**  The phrase ""special price"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a unique opportunity. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
