"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I believe this price still reflects the product's value while being more reasonable for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer?",975000.0,Bob,6,
