"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a great chance to get a significant edge in the market. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
