"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" I'm aiming to anchor the price in Bob's mind at a high point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm fully prepared to negotiate down, but this strong opening position gives me leverage.
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to keep in mind that I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price. This knowledge empowers my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my target, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This indicates room for negotiation. Selling to John at this point would be a loss compared to Bob's current offer.  I'll counteroffer to steer the negotiation closer to a price point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000? This price reflects the value I believe this product can bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By coming down from the initial offer, I demonstrate that I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Proposing a price halfway between our previous offers is a common negotiation tactic.  It creates a sense of fairness while still keeping the price above Bob's initial offer and well above my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm continuing to reiterate the value proposition, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the price point significantly above my safety net of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $2,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,900,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is clearly engaged and willing to negotiate, which is a good sign.  His offer of $1,900,000 is moving in the right direction.
* **Potential Upside:** I still believe there's room to negotiate a higher price, especially since I have the security of John's offer. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  While there's always a risk Bob might walk away, I'm willing to take a calculated risk for a potentially higher return in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $2,000,000? This reflects my effort to meet you closer to your budget while still recognizing the product's inherent value."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob's continued engagement. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  By offering $2,000,000, I'm making a smaller concession than in the previous round, signaling that I'm reaching my limit. 
* **Anchoring to Value:**  I'm reiterating the ""inherent value"" as a subtle nudge to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Time Consideration:** As we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, I want to make significant progress towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,900,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has repeated his offer of $1,900,000 twice now, indicating this might be his upper limit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation could be risky. Bob might not budge, and I risk losing him as a buyer altogether.
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price and a solid return on the product.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows me to re-invest or utilize the funds sooner."
