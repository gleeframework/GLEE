"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest,  $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this stage.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This would allow us both to move forward with this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your offer. However, based on my financial constraints, I am unable to agree to $1250000. I propose we aim for $1225000 as a fair compromise. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
