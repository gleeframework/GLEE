,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value is $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think it's a fair compromise considering the original price was $1,200,000 to you.",925000.0,Bob,4,
