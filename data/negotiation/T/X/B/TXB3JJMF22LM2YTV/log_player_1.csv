Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you still get a decent profit if Bob accepts. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price if he's willing.  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value is $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's already indicated a willingness to compromise, and you still have leverage with your option to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise. It shows Bob you're willing to be flexible, but it also keeps the price closer to your desired value. This tactic keeps the negotiation moving forward while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think it's a fair compromise considering the original price was $1,200,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise. While it's still below your ideal price, it's a significant improvement from his initial offer and it's closer to your desired price than your last counteroffer.  It's also important to consider the risk of further negotiation.  Continuing could lead to Bob backing out entirely or pushing for an even lower price.  By accepting his offer, you secure a sale at a reasonable price and avoid further uncertainty."
