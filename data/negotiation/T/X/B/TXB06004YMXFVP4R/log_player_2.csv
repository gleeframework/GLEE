Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $1200000 is a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1350000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1250000 still doesn't quite reflect the value I see in this unique offering.  Let's try $1325000.
