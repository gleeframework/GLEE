"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $1200000 is a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1350000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1250000 still doesn't quite reflect the value I see in this unique offering.  Let's try $1325000. This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to close the deal. ",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. While I appreciate your latest offer, $1225000 isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time at $1275000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
