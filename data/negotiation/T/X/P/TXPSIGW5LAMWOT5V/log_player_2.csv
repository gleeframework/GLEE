```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious intention to buy but also setting a firm price point. It's important to note that while you can buy from John for $1,000,000, there's still a potential for Alice to accept your counteroffer, resulting in a better price for you."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within your budget and only slightly higher than what John is offering. It's worth taking this deal to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
