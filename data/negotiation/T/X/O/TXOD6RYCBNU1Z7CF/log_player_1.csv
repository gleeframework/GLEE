"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's within a reasonable range for Bob, given the product's value to him. I'm hoping this will entice him to accept the offer without too much negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000.  This is still a good profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer and shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept the offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, his offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, as I'm already halfway through the negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,250,000.  This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm pushing my limits here.  I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to accept his low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure Bob is going to budge any further.  He's clearly willing to negotiate, but I'm risking the deal falling apart altogether if I keep rejecting his offers.  I'm also running out of time, with only four rounds left.

To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John. This is a safe option that guarantees me a profit, even if it's not the maximum I could have gotten."
