Round 6

# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,700. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,700 and my original offer of $8,800. How about $8,550? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,650, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

We've reached round 8, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not confident I can get him to budge in the remaining two rounds.  To guarantee I reach my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
