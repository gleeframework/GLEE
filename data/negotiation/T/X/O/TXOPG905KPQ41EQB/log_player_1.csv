"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob and I need to make a profit.  We'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80.  While it's better than nothing, it's far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob or John. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105.  This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer while still ensuring I make a profit. I believe this price is fair and could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if things don't improve quickly, I may consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to stick with a firm price of $95. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not going to settle for significantly less than what the product is worth to me. We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, so I need to be firm. If Bob doesn't agree, I might have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob consistently offering below my minimum, it's time to move on. John is a guaranteed $100, which is more than what Bob is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a sale."
