"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for you to make a profit.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $9,600 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",9600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a final compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
