"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You have no information about the product's true value, and rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price.  Buying from John at this point is also unnecessary, as Alice's initial offer is the same as John's.  It's better to see if you can get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a lowball offer of $1,000,000.  This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.  It's unlikely she'll accept this offer, but it will give me a sense of her willingness to negotiate and potentially reveal some information about her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $1,300,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still not sure if it's a good deal.  I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  There's no urgency to buy at this point, and John's price remains the same, so I'm still better off continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by dropping her price by $200,000.  I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to her offer but still significantly lower than her initial price. $1,150,000 is a reasonable middle ground, and I'm hoping she will accept it or counter with a price that's closer to my desired range.  If she rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has continued to reduce her price, which shows that she's interested in making a deal. However, I believe I can still get a better price.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get the product for closer to my desired price point. Buying from John at this point would be more expensive than Alice's current offer.  I'll continue to negotiate with Alice and see if I can close the deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has dropped her price again, and we're getting closer to a potential deal. I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway. I'm hoping this will either be accepted or lead to a final counteroffer that is within my budget."
