{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures that you're still getting more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's clear and concise:** This helps Bob understand the offer and respond quickly.

By offering a price above Bob's perceived value, you encourage him to negotiate, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement. You also leave yourself open to potentially getting closer to your desired $1,500,000 if you're willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you are willing to accept. While you want to get as much money as possible, you are also willing to walk away if necessary. This scenario represents an opportunity to potentially negotiate a better deal with Bob or accept the secure offer from John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it is still lower than what you are willing to accept. You are not pressured to sell the product, as you have a guaranteed buyer in John. It is more strategic to continue negotiations with Bob, aiming to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1290000, but no more. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below your desired minimum.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, John is a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay your minimum price.  It's best to secure the sale with John to avoid further risk and potential frustration with Bob."
