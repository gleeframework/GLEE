Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit but also seems willing to negotiate. At $1,025,000, we're getting a significant discount ($175,000) from John's price.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but there's also the risk that Alice won't budge further. It's a good balance of savings and minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
