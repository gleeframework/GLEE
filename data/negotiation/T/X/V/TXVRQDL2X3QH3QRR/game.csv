"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,250, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8250.0,Bob,4,
