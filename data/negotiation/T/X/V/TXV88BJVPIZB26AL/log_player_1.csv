Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** By starting high, you establish a higher baseline for negotiations. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer depending on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will give me a better chance of securing a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000? This would still give you a great deal while ensuring I get a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,200. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I can't get a much better deal from him. It's also slightly higher than what I'd get from John. Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell him the product for $12,200."
