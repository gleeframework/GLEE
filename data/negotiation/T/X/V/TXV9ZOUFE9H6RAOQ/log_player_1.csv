Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation.  It also acknowledges the value the product has to Bob, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $12,500? It's a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but $12,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,750 is a reasonable compromise and is still a good profit for me.  Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and ensures a sale."
