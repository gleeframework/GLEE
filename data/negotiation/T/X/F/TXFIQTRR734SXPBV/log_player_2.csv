"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $12,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely counter-offer, aiming to negotiate a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price below your maximum.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a polite and interested tone is crucial. You want to convey that you're serious about buying but need a more reasonable price.
* **Target Price in Mind:** Remember, your goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $9,000 is still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate further, aiming to get closer to $8,000. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about the lower price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to purchase the product at that price."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Stay Firm:** You're showing willingness to compromise by increasing your offer. However, you're still aiming below your absolute maximum ($8,000) to allow for some potential negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying you're ""ready to purchase,"" you signal to Alice that this is a serious offer, encouraging her to accept. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer puts you in a good position. If Alice rejects it, you can consider going up slightly (towards $8,000) or walking away and buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a small increase, but it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500. You've negotiated well, but it's now more strategic to take John's offer of $8,000. This saves you $500 and avoids the risk of Alice sticking to her price or the negotiation dragging on further."
