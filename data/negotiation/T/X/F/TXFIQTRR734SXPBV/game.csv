"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to purchase the product at that price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a small increase, but it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
