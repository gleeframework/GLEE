"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my budget of $150. I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting her offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to go down to $140? "", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower price than what I'm willing to pay to leave room for negotiation.  I believe $140 is a reasonable starting point, given that I'm willing to pay up to $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $160?  I think that's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $150. I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  $160 is still a bit high for me, but I'm feeling flexible.  How about $155?  I'm really eager to get this product, and I believe this price would be a win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product.  $155 is still within my budget, but it gives me some room to negotiate further if necessary."
