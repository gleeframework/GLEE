"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a generous offer considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm looking to invest at a lower price point. I'm happy to offer $900,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price still reflects a significant discount from the original offer, but I believe it's a more accurate representation of the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to close a deal that's mutually beneficial.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close to a deal, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This price still reflects a discount from the original offer, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
