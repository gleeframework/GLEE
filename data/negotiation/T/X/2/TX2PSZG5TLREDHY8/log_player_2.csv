"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and your interest, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This reflects not only its worth but also the opportunity it presents for you. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is more than his budget and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is fair given its value and my budget.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
