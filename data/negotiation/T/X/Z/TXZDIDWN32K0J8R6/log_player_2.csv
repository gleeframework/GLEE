"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $11,500, while John is offering it for $12,000.
* **The offer is within your budget:**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for a lower price than you would from John, saving you $500."
