Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $100 allows for some negotiation room while still being significantly more than your minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Appealing to Value:**  Mentioning that it's a fair price ""considering its value"" subtly hints at the product's worth to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Counter Offer:**  A direct question at the end encourages Bob to engage, potentially leading to a counter-offer that could still be very profitable for you.

By starting at $100, you maximize your chances of getting a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $120, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
