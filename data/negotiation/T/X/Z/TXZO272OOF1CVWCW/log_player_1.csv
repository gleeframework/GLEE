This is a starting point. I'm offering the product for $1,500,000, which is higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to get a price closer to my initial goal."

Bob is insistent on his price of $1,200,000. While this is my minimum acceptable price, I've already made a counteroffer and it seems unlikely he'll budge further.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure a guaranteed sale, I'll accept John's offer of $1,200,000."
