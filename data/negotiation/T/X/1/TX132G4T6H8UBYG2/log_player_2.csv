"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is within Bob's budget and only $500 more than his ideal price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or being forced to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional savings. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
