I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum threshold of $10,000, but still leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is interested.  If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $10,000, so there's no risk in trying to get a higher price."
