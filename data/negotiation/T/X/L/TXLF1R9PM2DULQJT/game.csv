"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. Let's find a middle ground here.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $135 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $145? I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's compromise at $142.50. This is a small adjustment from your last offer, and it gives me a bit more room to make sure I'm not losing out. What do you say?",142.5,Alice,7,
