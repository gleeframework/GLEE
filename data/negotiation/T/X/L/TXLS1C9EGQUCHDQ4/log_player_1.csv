Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than that.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a good deal. Since you have a backup offer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're emphasizing exclusivity and value to set the stage.
* **High but Reasonable:** The price is significantly below your minimum but leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit and still feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Confident Tone:** You're not desperate; you're offering a valuable opportunity.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! You maximized your profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. Be prepared to go down slightly, but hold firm above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:**  No problem. You have John waiting in the wings."
