Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer of $100 from John.

Offering the product at $130 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $20) while still netting you a $30 profit over your minimum and $30 more than John's offer. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the price attractive to Bob."
