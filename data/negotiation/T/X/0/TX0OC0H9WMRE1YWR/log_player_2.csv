"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice's offer is too high. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $150 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $110?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $130 for the product. It's a good price that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my target, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $130 is still a little steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $115. If you're willing to consider that, we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $125 for the product. It's a good price that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  I'd rather avoid the risk of a further stalemate and buy the product from John for $120."
