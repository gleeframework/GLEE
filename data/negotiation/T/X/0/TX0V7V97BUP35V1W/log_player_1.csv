Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives you some room to negotiate and allows you to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, and would be happy to pay $115. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what you initially hoped to earn.  It's worth trying to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $115 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to $125 for the product.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for $125, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. Let's split the difference - how about $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is your minimum acceptable price, and it's also the same price you can get from John. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as you've reached your goal."
