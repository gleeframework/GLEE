You can still try to get a lower price.  While $700,000 is better than $750,000, you are still paying more than you want to."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $685,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's meet at $685,000 and call it a day.

You are very close to your target price of $650,000. The product is worth $800,000 to you, and you would be buying it for $685,000. This is a good deal, and it's better than buying it from John for $800,000.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate will just waste time and ultimately end up with you paying more."
