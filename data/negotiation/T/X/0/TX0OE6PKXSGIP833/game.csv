"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $750,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $675,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $685,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's meet at $685,000 and call it a day.",685000.0,Alice,5,
