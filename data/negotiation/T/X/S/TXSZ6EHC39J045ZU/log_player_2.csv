Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is stubbornly holding out for a price that is higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it's likely to be a long and drawn-out process. Given that I have the option of buying from John at a fixed price of $1,000,000, it's more efficient to buy from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
