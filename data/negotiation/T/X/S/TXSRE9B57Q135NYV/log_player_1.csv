I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in paying a premium, but also leave myself space to negotiate down if necessary."

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still a bit higher than John's offer, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, this is enough to keep the negotiation going without risking losing him entirely."
