"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budgetary concerns, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you'll gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900,000 price point. Would it be possible to consider something closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
