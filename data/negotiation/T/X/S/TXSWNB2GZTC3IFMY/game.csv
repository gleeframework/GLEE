"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1000000?  That's a significant discount and would still provide you with a very valuable product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
