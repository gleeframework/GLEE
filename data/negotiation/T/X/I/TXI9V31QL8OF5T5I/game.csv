"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. That's still a good price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $13,500 is still too far from what the product is worth. I'm willing to drop to $14,500. If you're serious about buying, I believe this is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,
