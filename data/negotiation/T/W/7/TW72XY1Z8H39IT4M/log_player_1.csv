Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could meet you halfway between our two offers. Would $1,750,000 work for you?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
