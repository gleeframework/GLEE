{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still appealing to Bob, as the product is worth the same amount to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it for now.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $120? This is still a great price for a product worth that much to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
