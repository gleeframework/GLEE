"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is quite a way from what I have in mind.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle â€“ how about we consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $900,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand where you're coming from, but that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground: how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see the value in this product, but I have a firm budget.  My final offer is $950,000.  Take it or leave it.",950000.0,Bob,6,
