"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is $1025000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and what you'll gain from it. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $975000.  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous one, at $1000000. This would be a good middle ground that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $1075000. This is the final concession I'm willing to make, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're reaching your limit, but I'm still a little hesitant at $1075000. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1025000. This is my final offer, and it would be a good compromise for both of us. It's important to close this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground on this price.",1025000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get closer to my target. However, I'm willing to make one last effort to close the deal. My revised offer is $1075000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 10% discount on the total price. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
