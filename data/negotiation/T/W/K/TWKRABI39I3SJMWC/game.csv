"While I appreciate the offer, $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a great compromise that should work for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $1,075,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,095,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1095000.0,Alice,5,
