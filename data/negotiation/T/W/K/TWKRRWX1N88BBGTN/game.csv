"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $9000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. Can you consider $9750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible.  However, $9750 is still too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to drop to $10250, which is a fair price considering the value it offers. This is my final offer. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9800 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is my absolute final price. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
