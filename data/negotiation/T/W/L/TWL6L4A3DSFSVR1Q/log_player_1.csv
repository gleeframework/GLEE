Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
