Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product while ensuring I can still make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued interest. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be able to at least get $925,000 for the product.
