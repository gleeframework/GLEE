"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is too high, and I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep. While I recognize the product's value, I'm looking to pay a price closer to $900,000. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreeable compromise. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to establish a lower starting point for negotiations.  This aggressive counteroffer also signals my intent to save as much money as possible.  I'm confident that we can find a middle ground, but I'm willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down considerably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for me. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming to save more money.  I'll continue negotiating and make another counteroffer in the next round.  The price from John is my baseline, and I'm motivated to get a better deal than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm slowly increasing my offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget.  $950,000 is a good compromise, as it's closer to Alice's counteroffer while still being within my acceptable range.  I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my preferred price, but it is getting closer. I'm not ready to accept it yet and will continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. I'm also keeping in mind that John's offer is a backup option, so I'm not pressured to accept anything above $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're making progress, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it's a price that I can comfortably afford. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to raise my offer slowly, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while staying close to my budget. This counteroffer is just $50,000 below Alice's last offer, showing that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. I believe there's a good chance Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. Considering the value of the product to you and the fact that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and my previous offer of $1,025,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally reached my baseline price of $1,000,000. While I would prefer to pay less, accepting this offer allows me to secure the product without further negotiation and avoid any potential risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer.  Since John is also selling the product at this price, I'm comfortable moving forward with this deal."
