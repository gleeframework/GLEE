,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still outside my budget. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm prepared to offer $14,000. This price reflects the value of the product for me and allows us to move closer to a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $17,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $17,000 remains a bit out of my price range.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $15,000. This offer represents my absolute maximum. I believe it's a fair compromise, as it's significantly closer to your last offer and within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,6,
