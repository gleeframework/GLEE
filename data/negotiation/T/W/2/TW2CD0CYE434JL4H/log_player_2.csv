"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above my absolute maximum. This allows for some negotiation space while also establishing my firm upper limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal for the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a slightly lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing my absolute maximum price of $10,000.  This signals my willingness to buy the product, but it also leaves no room for further negotiation.  By mentioning other options, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have alternatives if she doesn't accept."
