Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal selling price, but I'm also willing to accept $150 from John if Bob doesn't want to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. It's less than half of what I consider to be the minimum value of the product. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more time to get a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $160. This is a compromise, but I'm still hoping to make a decent profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $150."
