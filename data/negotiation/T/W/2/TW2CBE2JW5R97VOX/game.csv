,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer you the product for $1000000. This is my best price, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
