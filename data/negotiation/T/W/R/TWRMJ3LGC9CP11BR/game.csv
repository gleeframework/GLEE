"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but $15,000 is too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but $8,000 is still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $13,000. This is my final offer for now.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. However, $13,000 is still a stretch.  I can go up to $9,500.  This offer represents a serious commitment on my part, but I need to stay within reasonable limits.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,500, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $9,500, which would be $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,250 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? This is a strong offer, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I can meet you at $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",11000.0,Alice,7,
