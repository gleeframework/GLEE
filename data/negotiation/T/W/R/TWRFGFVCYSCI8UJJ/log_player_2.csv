"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its value and significance to you, we believe it's worth $15,000. However, to make this offer more appealing, we're considering a special deal. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $14,000? This is a fantastic opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a slightly reduced price. Let us know your thoughts, and we'll proceed accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John if necessary. By rejecting this offer, you give Alice a chance to potentially lower her price further. There's room for negotiation."
