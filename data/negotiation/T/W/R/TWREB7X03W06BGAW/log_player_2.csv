"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that works well for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Alice's starting price is too high. While she expresses flexibility, it's in your best interest to see if she'll come down closer to your budget before considering accepting.  You have a backup option with John at $800,000, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Alice."
