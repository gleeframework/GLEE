"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $12,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If not, I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see where Bob stands first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, so I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I will try to get closer to my target price with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway."
