Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects that."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum ($10,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup plan."
