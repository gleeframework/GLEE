Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your desire to keep costs down. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Could we possibly agree on $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is showing willingness to meet closer to your price, and $12,500 is a reasonable profit above your minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome.
