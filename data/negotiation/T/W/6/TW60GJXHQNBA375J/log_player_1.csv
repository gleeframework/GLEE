"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I'm hoping to leverage John's offer as leverage to secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'm running out of rounds, but I believe I can still get a better price with a few more counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've run out of time to negotiate with Bob. While I'm hoping for a better price, John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable profit. I'll accept his offer to ensure I don't lose out on a significant gain."
