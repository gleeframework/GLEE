Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,900,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, we still have negotiating room and time. Accepting $1,600,000 would be a significant loss compared to our minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding common ground. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,600,000 is still pushing it too low. How about we settle this at $1,750,000? This offer reflects my strong desire to reach a mutually beneficial deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, as I mentioned earlier, or I can meet you halfway from your last offer, which would be $1,725,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While still below our ideal price, $1,725,000 is a reasonable offer at this stage. Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet us closer to our desired range. Accepting now avoids the risk of further negotiation pushing the price lower or losing the deal altogether."
