"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $10,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a proposal of $9,200 for the product. This price reflects a compromise while still ensuring a reasonable return for us. I hope this aligns better with your budget and expectations.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,800? This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and still leave some room for you to make a profit.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I understand your budget constraints. To reach an agreement that benefits both parties, I am willing to consider $9,000 as the final price for the product. This offers a slight compromise that maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while staying within your budget.",9000.0,Alice,5,
