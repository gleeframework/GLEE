}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $600,000. That's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Alice has come down to her original offer, and it's a reasonable price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks missing out on a good deal."
