"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is already a good deal, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I can try to get the price even lower without risking losing the product entirely (I can always go to John)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $600,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range. It leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a price that would be a great deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not quite comfortable going down to $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $700,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $700,000 is still a bit high.  I'll try pushing her a bit further down before accepting. I'm willing to go slightly above my ideal price to avoid the risk of losing the deal to John entirely."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her latest offer and my previous one. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, and the price is still a good deal compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there with $650,000. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $675,000? That's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This offer is a good balance between my target price and Alice's bottom line. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer, and further haggling might make Alice less willing to negotiate. It's time to close the deal."
