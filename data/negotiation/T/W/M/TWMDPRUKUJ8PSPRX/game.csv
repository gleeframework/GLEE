"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $600,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not quite comfortable going down to $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there with $650,000. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $675,000? That's the best I can do at this point.",675000.0,Alice,5,
