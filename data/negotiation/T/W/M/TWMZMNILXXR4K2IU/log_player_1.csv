{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. 
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Intriguing message:** I'm trying to pique Bob's interest by highlighting the product's value.

This is a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the information I gain about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial $100, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is my minimum,  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's split the difference and make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I show Bob I'm listening to his concerns and that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Compromising:** I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than my minimum.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using positive language like ""make this happen"" to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer aims to find a price that is more appealing to Bob while still getting me closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $85? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum and it's likely he won't budge further.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and guarantees a profit. Further negotiation could risk losing him as a buyer and ending up with the lower price from John."
