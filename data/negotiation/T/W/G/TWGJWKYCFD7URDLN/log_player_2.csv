Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500?  This price still reflects the value of the product, but allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.

I think this is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.
