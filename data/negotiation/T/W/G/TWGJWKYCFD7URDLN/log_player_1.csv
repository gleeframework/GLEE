Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's a [brief description of the product], and I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant margin above my minimum price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Building Value:**  I briefly describe the product to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much information. This keeps the focus on the potential value of the product to him.
* **Open Ended:** My message invites Bob to engage in the negotiation by asking for his thoughts. This encourages him to respond and gives me a chance to gauge his interest.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product at a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it based on his price and any additional information he might provide. I'll also consider the potential risks of continuing negotiations versus selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob has shown interest, his offer is significantly lower than my starting price. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price. It's possible Bob might be willing to pay more after a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price still reflects the value of the product, but allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but clearly stating my minimum price point.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $8,500, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility and makes my counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to reinforce its worth and justify my price point.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired amount.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully assess his next counteroffer. If it's still too low, I'll need to decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we try $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of getting stuck:** If I accept, I'm essentially settling for less than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation, hoping to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price point. I'll make sure my counteroffer is persuasive and emphasizes the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Since you're willing to move up from your initial offer, how about we try $8,000? This is my absolute minimum, and it reflects the value of the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but framing it as a compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Acknowledging Progress:** I acknowledge Bob's willingness to increase his offer, signaling that we're making progress.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating that $8,000 is my absolute minimum, I create a sense of urgency and subtly pressure Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a fair price for the product.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I will have to seriously consider selling the product to John for $8,000.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation may not be worth the potential gains."
