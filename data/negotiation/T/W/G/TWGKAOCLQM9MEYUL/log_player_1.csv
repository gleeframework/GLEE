Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Ideally, you want to get a price as close as possible to this without him rejecting the offer.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about your deal with John. This gives you an advantage.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and the high demand I'm seeing, I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting with a price significantly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:**  While you don't reveal your guaranteed sale, you vaguely allude to high demand and value, justifying the high price.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get $950,000, a great deal for you.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer.  Depending on his offer, you can decide to:
    * Accept if it's close enough to your minimum.
    * Counter-offer again, slowly moving towards his valuation.
    * Walk away if he's too far off and sell to John.
* **Bob Rejects Outright:**  You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important:** Even though you have a backup buyer, aim high with Bob initially. You never know how negotiations might turn out, and you could secure a better deal than you expected!"
