"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob! However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to settle at $100, Bob. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  To be honest, I'm considering other options at this point. If you'd be willing to come down to $105, I'm ready to make a deal right now.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet! I'm willing to meet you at $108, which is a bit more than your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you say?",108.0,Alice,7,
