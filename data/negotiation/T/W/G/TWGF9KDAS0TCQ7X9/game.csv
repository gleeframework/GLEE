"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  That's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering your value for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price of $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering your value for the product and my maximum budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $11,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think we're not going to reach an agreement, and I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
