"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value and features of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Could you consider $17,000?  I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $15,000. This amount reflects what I believe is a fair compromise between our positions. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory outcome for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
