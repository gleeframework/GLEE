"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the price is tempting, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm happy to consider a price of $8500.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save money, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, Alice, but $9250 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $8750? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow us to move forward with the transaction.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8900.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $8900. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9050. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",9050.0,Alice,7,
