"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $150, but you can get a better deal by either negotiating with Alice or buying from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Alice's cost but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also trying to get a good deal. This counteroffer gives Alice room to negotiate without losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still closer to John's price than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm staying below Alice's latest offer, demonstrating that I'm still trying to get a better price. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it is closer to my maximum price of $150, I'm still not comfortable with that price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if I can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $120. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm getting closer to accepting a deal. However, I'm still below Alice's current offer, leaving room for further negotiation. This is a strategic move to test Alice's willingness to compromise and get closer to a price we both can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice's offer is still too high.  It's now closer to John's price, and it's not clear that further negotiation will get us a better deal.  Since I'm only willing to pay up to $150, I'll buy from John to avoid the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice and potentially running out of time."
