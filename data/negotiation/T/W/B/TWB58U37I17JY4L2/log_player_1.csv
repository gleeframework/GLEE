I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $15,000 to me and $10,000 to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a good starting point to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand that $11,000 is still above the value of the product to him, it is too far below the minimum amount I'm willing to accept ($15,000). I'm going to try and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000.  This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects both of our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to keep negotiating further. John is offering a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere."
