"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the description of the product.  However, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for it, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the absolute most I can afford.  What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $16750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",16750.0,Alice,5,
