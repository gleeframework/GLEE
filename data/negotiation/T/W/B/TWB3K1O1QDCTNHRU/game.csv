"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
