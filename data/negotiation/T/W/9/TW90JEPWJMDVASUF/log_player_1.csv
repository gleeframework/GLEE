Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** $175 allows for some potential negotiation, making it more likely Bob will counteroffer rather than immediately reject.
* **Protecting Minimum Value:**  This price is higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150), but leaves room for compromise before I'd consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $125.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm not desperate to sell at this point.  I'm willing to risk a bit more negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** I'm now offering the absolute minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is still a significant profit for me.
* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm clear that I'm not willing to go lower, but I'm still trying to negotiate a mutually acceptable price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  By holding firm at $150, I'm avoiding a loss and increasing the likelihood of a deal while keeping open the option of selling to John if necessary."
