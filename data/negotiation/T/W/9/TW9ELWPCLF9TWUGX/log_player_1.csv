Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $15,000 valuation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying significantly above our minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as fair, emphasizing the value to Bob. This can make him more receptive to the offer."
