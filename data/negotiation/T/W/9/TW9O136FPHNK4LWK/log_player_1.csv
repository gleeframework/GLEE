Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but we're still far apart.  It's time to push a bit more and see if he's really willing to meet closer to the product's value to him."

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $950,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation."
