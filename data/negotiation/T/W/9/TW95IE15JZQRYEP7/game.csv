"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $1,300,000? This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm trying to be reasonable, but $1,275,000 is still too high for me. How about $1,220,000? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
