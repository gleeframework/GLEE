Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort and the increase in your offer, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $13,000.

It's unlikely Alice will go down to a price that makes sense for you. You've made good progress in the negotiation, but every counteroffer is getting you closer to your walk-away point. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the price you know is fair."
