"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it offers a lot of value and would be very beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both my maximum price and her value for the product. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low offer that matches Alice's perceived value of the product. This approach allows me to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a great deal. Even if she rejects this initial offer, it sets a lower anchor for future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good. However, $115 is still closer to her initial offer than mine. I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant on $115.  Could you do $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target. This offer puts us in a good position for a potential agreement."
