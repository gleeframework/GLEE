Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $925,000 leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""exclusive opportunity"", ""significant return on investment"") might make him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
