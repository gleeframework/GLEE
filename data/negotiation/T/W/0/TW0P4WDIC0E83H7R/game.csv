"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $75? It's the most I can afford right now.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $82 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $80? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",80.0,Bob,4,
