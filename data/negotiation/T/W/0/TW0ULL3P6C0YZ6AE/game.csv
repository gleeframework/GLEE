"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you've described.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1750000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1625000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1625000.0,Bob,4,
