Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your ideal price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get her closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000. However, I'm still stuck at my maximum of $12,000.  If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, but $13,500 is still outside of Bob's budget. While it's tempting to accept, it's worth pushing for a lower price or considering the alternative option of buying from John.  Even a small difference can be significant in the long run."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
