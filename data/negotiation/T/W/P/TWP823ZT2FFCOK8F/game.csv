"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Unfortunately, I'm still unable to go above $12,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to accept it.",12000.0,Bob,6,
