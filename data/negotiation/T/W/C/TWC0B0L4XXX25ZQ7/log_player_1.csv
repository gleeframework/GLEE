"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" I'm framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.  
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial price is high, it allows Bob to counter,  keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value but still significantly below my minimum. I'll reject it to signal I'm looking for a price closer to my valuation. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant and unique value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer to show I'm engaged in the negotiation.
* **Standing Firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm making it clear that $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Proposing $1,750,000 is a classic negotiation tactic. It suggests fairness and encourages Bob to move closer to my target price.  I'm still aiming to capture as much value above my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range.  Let's try $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could push for more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away.  Each round brings uncertainty, and I'd rather secure a good profit now than risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **""Fair Price"" Language:** Bob's language suggests he's getting close to his limit. It's unlikely he'll move significantly higher."
