This is a good point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Price:**  $1,107,500 is a strong profit margin, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. Accepting now capitalizes on his momentum.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations on carries the risk of Bob losing interest or finding an alternative. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potential lost opportunities with John."
