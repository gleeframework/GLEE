Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $912,500. I can offer it to you for $915,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $915,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $912,500.  At this point, I'm confident that we're nearing a point where a deal is possible.  I'm also aware that if I reject this offer and keep negotiating, there's a chance she'll walk away, leaving me with no product and having to buy it from John for a much higher price. It's time to accept and secure the product at a decent price."
