"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer closer to your ideal outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's initial reaction.
* **Not Too High:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting too high (e.g., $1,450,000) might discourage him or make him question the negotiation process. 
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:**  This offer leaves space for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth that could still lead to a highly profitable deal for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant jump from our initial ask, indicating room for negotiation. While selling to John is our safety net, we're still aiming for a much higher profit. We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. Let's find a compromise. How about we settle at $1,275,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your investment target."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,200,000) and our previous asking price ($1,300,000).  
* **Strong but Flexible:**  We're signaling willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price significantly above our guaranteed sale with John.
* **Clear Justification:** Highlighting the product's value reminds Bob why this is a worthwhile investment even at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:**  $1,250,000 is a strong profit, exceeding our minimum by $450,000.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob is consistently moving towards our price range, but his increments are getting smaller.  Holding out for much more might risk the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner allows us to re-invest the earnings or use them for other opportunities."
