Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'd be willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you'll make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate and potentially accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This strategy allows for a back-and-forth that could lead to a more mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is above your minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get closer to your desired price of $100 by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95}
