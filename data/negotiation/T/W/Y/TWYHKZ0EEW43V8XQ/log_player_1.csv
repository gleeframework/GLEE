{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counter. It also allows me to potentially secure a higher price than John's offer, while leaving open the option to go with John if Bob doesn't come around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $900,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident I can secure an offer closer to $900,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
