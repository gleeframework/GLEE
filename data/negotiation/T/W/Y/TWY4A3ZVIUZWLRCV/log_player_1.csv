Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for a product worth $100 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $87.50 is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $87.5 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our back and forth, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $89 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $88, but I don't think I can go any higher. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the value to Bob and the time spent negotiating.  It's also higher than what I would get from John."
