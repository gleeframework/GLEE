"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, as I want to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so $1,500,000 is a good starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating. We're already in round 4, and the price is getting closer to John's offer.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $100,000, and it's better than the risk of ending up with John's offer, which would be a loss."
