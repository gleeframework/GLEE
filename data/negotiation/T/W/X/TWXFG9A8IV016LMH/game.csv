,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100, so how about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close the deal at $112, and we can both walk away happy.",112.0,Alice,5,
