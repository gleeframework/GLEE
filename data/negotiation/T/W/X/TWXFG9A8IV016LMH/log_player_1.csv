"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price of $115, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also ensures that I'm still making a profit.  I'm hoping to close the deal quickly, but I'm ready to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to make the sale, I'm not willing to go that low. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with a price of $110. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a price Bob is willing to consider. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100, so how about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close the deal at $112, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 112}
``` 

I'm countering with a price of $112. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a significant concession from my previous offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal at a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close the deal at $110, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is a price that is still profitable for me and a good deal for Bob. I'm hoping that after 6 rounds of negotiation, Bob will agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to go above $108, and I'm starting to think I might need to look elsewhere. Can you meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 and avoid risking further negotiations that could result in an even lower price."
