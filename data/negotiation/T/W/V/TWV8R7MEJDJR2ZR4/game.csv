"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1500000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1200000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $800000.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1200000. How about we meet at $1075000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1075000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $925000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",925000.0,Bob,6,
