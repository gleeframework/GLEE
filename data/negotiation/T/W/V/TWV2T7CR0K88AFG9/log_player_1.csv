"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies willingness to find a price that works for both parties, signaling you're open to offers and counteroffers. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum, you have room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly above $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't afford to pay more than $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a significant price reduction to make this deal work.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your desired price and the product's value to you. While you want to negotiate, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss. You have room to negotiate down from your initial offer and should aim for a price closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  While my initial offer reflects the true value of this product, I understand your position.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** It's important to show you've heard and understood Bob's position. This builds rapport and encourages continued negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:** Re-emphasizing the product's value helps justify a higher price, even if you're making a concession.
* **Significant but Gradual Reduction:** Dropping $300,000 shows flexibility but avoids a drastic cut that might undervalue the product or make you appear desperate.  
* **Aiming High:**  You're still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum and Bob's offer. There's room for further negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate the reduction, $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant step towards your asking price and demonstrates my genuine interest. Let's see if we can find a compromise around this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased significantly, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). You have the guaranteed option of selling to John, so there's no need to settle for less than your safety net. You can use the remaining rounds to negotiate with Bob further and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're moving closer to a deal. Your latest offer is certainly more attractive. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a fair resolution. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  Acknowledging progress and using phrases like ""more attractive"" keeps the tone encouraging.
* **Strategic Concession:** You've made another substantial drop ($300,000), but you're still above your guaranteed price with John.
* **""Meeting Halfway"":** This framing makes your offer seem more appealing and reasonable, even though it's not a precise halfway point. 
* **Seeking Input:**  Ending with a question invites Bob's response and encourages him to engage further in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer,  $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to meet you at $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a solid midpoint between our current positions. Let's see if we can close this deal with a mutually agreeable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now above your absolute minimum, you still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. Bob is clearly motivated and has been steadily increasing his offer. It's worth seeing if you can bridge the remaining gap before settling for $1,200,000 or accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close!  I can see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and the progress we've made in this negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is your final offer, you aim to encourage Bob to take this proposal seriously and avoid prolonged back-and-forth.
* **Slight Concession, Above Minimum:** You're making a smaller concession this round ($50,000) to signal you're reaching your limit but still offering a price above your fallback option with John.
* **Justifying the Price:** Reiterating the value proposition reinforces why your offer is reasonable, even if it's not Bob's ideal price.
* **Aiming for a Quick Resolution:**  With fewer rounds remaining, you want to either secure a deal with Bob quickly or move on to John to avoid the risk of Bob not reaching your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution, and your offer is getting closer to my budget. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a good compromise, and I hope we can close the deal with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Limited Rounds:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), and you only have two rounds left. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob not increasing his offer sufficiently or walking away. Accepting now secures a significant profit. 
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** You've consistently maintained a strong position throughout the negotiation and extracted substantial concessions from Bob.

While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, the difference is relatively small at this point, and the risk of losing the deal altogether likely outweighs the potential reward."
