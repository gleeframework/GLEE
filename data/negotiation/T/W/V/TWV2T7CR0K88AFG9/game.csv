"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't afford to pay more than $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a significant price reduction to make this deal work. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  While my initial offer reflects the true value of this product, I understand your position.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate the reduction, $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant step towards your asking price and demonstrates my genuine interest. Let's see if we can find a compromise around this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're moving closer to a deal. Your latest offer is certainly more attractive. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a fair resolution. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer,  $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to meet you at $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a solid midpoint between our current positions. Let's see if we can close this deal with a mutually agreeable compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and the progress we've made in this negotiation.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution, and your offer is getting closer to my budget. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a good compromise, and I hope we can close the deal with this offer.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
