Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth without directly stating his maximum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you mention other buyers, you don't want to sound desperate.  Subtly implying other interested parties creates a sense of urgency.

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still giving him a chance to accept a fair offer."
