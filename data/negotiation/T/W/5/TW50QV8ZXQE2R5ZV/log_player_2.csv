# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her actual value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's closer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He can use the knowledge that Alice is willing to drop her price to try and reach a compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob has already successfully pushed Alice down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000.  It's unlikely he'll be able to get her to drop the price any further.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
