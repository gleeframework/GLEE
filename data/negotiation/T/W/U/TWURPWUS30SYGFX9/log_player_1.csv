Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high demand and value, justifying the higher price. 
* **Urgency:** The mention of ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is based on maximizing profit. A softer approach with a lower starting price could also be successful, depending on your desired relationship with Bob.
* Bob's personality and negotiation style are unknown. You may need to adjust your strategy based on his responses."
