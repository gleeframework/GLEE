"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You can do better than $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $13,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering its value, and it allows for a smooth transaction for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would love to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $13,500 is still a good deal for me, considering John is selling it for $15,000.  It's worth locking in this price."
