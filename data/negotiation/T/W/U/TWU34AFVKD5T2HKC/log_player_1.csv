Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. How about we bring it down significantly to something more manageable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need you to meet me closer to my budget. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below the product's value to us and what John is offering. We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  So am I, and that's why I need to be firm on its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Finality:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Matching John's Offer:**  We're now at the point where accepting John's offer is equally as profitable as continuing with Bob. This puts pressure on Bob to make a strong move if he's really interested. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Barely):** While we've stated this is our final offer, there's a slight chance Bob might counter with a number very close to $1,000,000, which we could consider."
