"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high benchmark and leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe we can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can close the gap further."

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,600,000. This is another compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping this shows that I'm serious about closing a deal, but not at the expense of my profit."
