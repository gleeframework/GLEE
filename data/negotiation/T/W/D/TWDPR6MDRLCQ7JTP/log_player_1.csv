Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, we want to see if we can get a better price from Bob first.
* **Understanding Value:** The product is worth significantly more to you than Bob. This means there's room for negotiation where both parties can benefit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and making it a limited-time offer, we incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price. If Bob accepts, we exceed our minimum; if not, we have John as a reliable backup."
