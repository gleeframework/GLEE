"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
