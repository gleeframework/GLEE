Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

While continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a slightly higher price, it's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer further. Accepting his $130 offer is a loss compared to John's guaranteed $150.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
