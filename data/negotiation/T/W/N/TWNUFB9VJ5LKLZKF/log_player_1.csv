Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,700,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Directness:**  Directly stating the price avoids any ambiguity and allows Bob to understand your position.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and offering a fair chance to purchase the product."
