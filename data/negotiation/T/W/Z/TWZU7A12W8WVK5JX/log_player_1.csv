Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This makes it appealing to Bob while still securing a substantial profit for you ( $150,000 over your minimum).
* **Urgency and Competition:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to accept quickly.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer.  However, this strategy balances risk and reward effectively."
