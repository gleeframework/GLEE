"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is just too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $115. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $107.50. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to stay within my budget.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $107.50 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $111.25? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",111.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my means.",110.0,Bob,6,
