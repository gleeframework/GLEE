"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $130. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is just too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $115. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $107.50. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to $115.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $107.50 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $111.25? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 111.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still not ideal, it's getting close to my desired price and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's better to secure a deal at $110 now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for $150."
