"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a chance to gain a valuable asset worth considerably more to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit above our minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's unique value and potential gain for Bob can make the high price more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We are prepared to negotiate, but starting high allows us to potentially secure a better deal than if we began with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is above our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We are aiming for a price closer to his perceived value. Rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer allows us to gauge his flexibility and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your number, how about we settle at $1,120,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We've come down from our initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Incremental Steps:**  The decrease is significant but not drastic, keeping the momentum of the negotiation moving.
* **Reiterate Value:** By mentioning the ""true value,"" we subtly remind Bob of the potential benefits, encouraging him to meet us closer to our price."
