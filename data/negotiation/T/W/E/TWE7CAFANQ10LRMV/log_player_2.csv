"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, accepting Alice's initial offer would use up his entire budget. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a reasonable counteroffer, aiming for a 13% discount.  This shows he's interested but not willing to pay full price. It's a good starting point to see how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $140, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $10 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might save a few more dollars, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it at this point."
