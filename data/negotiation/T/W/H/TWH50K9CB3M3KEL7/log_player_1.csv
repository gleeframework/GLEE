Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $900,000 is higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $900,000 is still significantly below your minimum of $1,000,000, so you have room to lower the price if needed.
* **It's open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for negotiation, letting Bob know you're willing to discuss a fair price.

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of getting a deal with Bob while still keeping your options open to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm hopeful that I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a good value and me to get closer to my minimum. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $825,000. I hope we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is close to my target price and significantly higher than his initial offer.  It's a good compromise that allows me to secure a deal with Bob and get closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd ideally want more,  the risk of further negotiation with Bob or selling to John at a lower price than I'd like makes accepting Bob's offer the most reasonable choice."
