"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Bob is trying to save as much as possible and should aim for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to work with."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $7,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $7,250.  I'm really interested in this product, but I have a budget to stick to.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 7250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $7,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $7,400. It's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now only $200 away from Bob's target price of $7,250. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, and there's a high chance further negotiation won't yield much more savings.  Continuing to negotiate risks going over the 10 rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price."
