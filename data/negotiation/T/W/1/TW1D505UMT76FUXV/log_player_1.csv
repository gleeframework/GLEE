Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a strong fallback option (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price.  This allows you to push for a higher price with Bob. 

**The Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a time-sensitive offer as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000 
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of scarcity and desirability can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **High Initial Price:** Starting significantly above your minimum ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) reinforces the idea that he could miss out.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be extremely price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower but still above your minimum.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go. Remember, your bottom line is $1,500,000."
