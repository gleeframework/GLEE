"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $9,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's offer of $10,000.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer."
