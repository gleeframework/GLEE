Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While John guarantees $15,000, getting even slightly more from Bob is preferable.
* **High but not Unreasonable:** $14,999 is just below your guaranteed price. It's a high price that reflects the product's value to you, but it might tempt Bob if he's keen on acquiring it. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's still above your $15,000 baseline.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob is a calculated risk worth taking."
