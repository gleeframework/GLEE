"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my research and budget, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $700000 to $750000. I hope we can find common ground.",725000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, considering the value I place on the product, I'm not comfortable going as low as $725000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $750000.
