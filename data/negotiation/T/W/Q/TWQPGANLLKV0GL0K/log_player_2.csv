"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a great price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $150 from John, so paying $120 to Alice wouldn't be a good deal for me.
