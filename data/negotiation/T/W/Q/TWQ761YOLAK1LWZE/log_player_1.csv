"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a profit margin. I believe this is a fair offer considering Bob's initial counteroffer and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000. I will counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, time is running out and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for my minimum price.  I'm going to sell to John."
