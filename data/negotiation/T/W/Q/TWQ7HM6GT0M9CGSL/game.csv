"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given our budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  Given the value of this product to you, I believe $1,100,000 is a fair and mutually beneficial price.  Let's find common ground to close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I've reviewed Alice's latest offer, and while I appreciate her willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. My company has a strict budget and I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,050,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
