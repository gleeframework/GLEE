"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be able to find another buyer if you're not comfortable with that price.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $80. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $81.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",81.5,Alice,5,
