"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. My starting price is $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $120.  What do you say?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160 to make this work. Let me know if that's something you can work with.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  Let's make this happen.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $140 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $145 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about $135?  That would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,6,
