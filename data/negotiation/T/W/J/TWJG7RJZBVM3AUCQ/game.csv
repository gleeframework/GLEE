"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. I think this price still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your willingness to compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, and I appreciate your effort to reach a fair agreement. However, I believe we can still lower the price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit too close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but it's going to be my last. I'm proposing a price of $880000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with an offer of $870000. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable to you.",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already made it clear that $880000 is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this point.",880000.0,Alice,7,
