"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1280000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1280000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1280000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1250000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1300000, which is actually my initial offer. I'm willing to revisit this price, considering you've shown a willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1320000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1290500, which is just $500 above your last offer. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price, but if not, I may need to consider other options.",1290500.0,Alice,9,
