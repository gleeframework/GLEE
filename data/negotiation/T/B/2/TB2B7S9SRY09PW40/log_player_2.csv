"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,100,000 is significantly more than Alice's valuation of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is a last resort:** While $1,500,000 is your maximum budget, it's better to try and get a better deal from Alice first. 
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers:** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still more than halfway between her valuation and your counteroffer. 
* **More room for negotiation:** There's still potential to get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** While buying from John is an option, rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay at this time. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000. This feels like a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,020,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is closer, but still too high:** While $1,020,000 is a significant reduction from her previous offer, it's still above the price you'd like to pay. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** There's still room to negotiate a lower price. You've shown a willingness to come up, and Alice has shown flexibility, so continuing the negotiation has good potential.
* **Risk of losing the deal is growing:** While buying from John is an option, rejecting the offer gives you another chance to get a better deal from Alice. However, you need to be mindful of the rounds remaining."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm seeing progress in our negotiation, but $1,020,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,010,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1010000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and buying from John is becoming a more realistic option. 
* **Alice's offer is fair:** $1,015,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $1,010,000, and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting the offer risks losing the deal with Alice and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal and allows you to close the transaction."
