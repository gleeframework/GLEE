"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to engage and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for, and selling to John would be less profitable.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still maintaining a profit margin that is higher than selling to John. This shows flexibility to Bob while also ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,100,000. There are still rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
``` 

I'm going to compromise a little more, but still holding out for a price closer to my ideal. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to give in completely."
