{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than the price from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive in his first counteroffer. He's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to test the waters and see how willing Alice is to negotiate.  He's also staying within his budget of $1,200,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to push for a lower price, especially since he has 7 rounds left and is within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is a good middle ground between his last offer and Alice's current offer. It also keeps him within his budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $90,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  It's within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's more likely that Alice will become more stubborn and less likely to accept a lower offer. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
