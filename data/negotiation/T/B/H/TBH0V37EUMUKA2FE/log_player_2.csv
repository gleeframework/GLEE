Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise.  I believe this price reflects the product's value while still being within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
