Round 3
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to consider $850,000 as my final offer.  However, I need to be upfront - if this doesn't work, I have another interested buyer I need to engage with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and she's introduced a sense of urgency with the other potential buyer.  While you *might* be able to get the price down a little more, it's not worth the risk of losing the product entirely. John offers a sure thing at $800,000, which is your maximum target price."
