"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $15000, which is my maximum.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is your maximum budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $16500? It's a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we discuss $17500?",17500.0,Alice,5,
