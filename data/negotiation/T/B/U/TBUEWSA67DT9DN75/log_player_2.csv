"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that's worth even more to you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $1,500,000."
