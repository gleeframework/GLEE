Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
