"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
