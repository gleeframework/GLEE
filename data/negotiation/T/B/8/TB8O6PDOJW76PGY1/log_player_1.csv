"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high price allows for negotiation room and sets a strong starting point.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:** The message highlights the value of the product for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, encouraging continued negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the negotiation open for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we discuss $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to his valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob.  I can still try to achieve a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially push for a more favorable outcome. 

**Next steps:** I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This price still gives you a significant value for the product, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I've lowered my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still maintained a price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:**  The message highlights the value Bob would still receive at this price, incentivizing him to accept.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a reasonable compromise, signaling willingness to find common ground.

This approach aims to find a middle ground, making the deal more attractive to Bob while still securing a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, and while I appreciate the compromise, I still feel that the product's value aligns more closely with my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. This might help us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price than I'd prefer.
* **Time constraint:**  We're only on round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of time.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable deal. It's important to weigh the potential for a better offer against the risk of losing a deal altogether."
