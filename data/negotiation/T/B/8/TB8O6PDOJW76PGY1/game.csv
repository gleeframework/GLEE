"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we discuss $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This price still gives you a significant value for the product, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
