Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above my minimum acceptable value and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, it will encourage Bob to continue negotiating in good faith."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a higher offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, showing that I'm willing to work with Bob, but it's still a price that I feel is fair. I'm hoping that this will be enough to close the deal, but I'm also prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still not satisfactory. It's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not worth risking further negotiation.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation."
