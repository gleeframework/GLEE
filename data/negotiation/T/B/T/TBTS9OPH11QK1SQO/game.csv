"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. The product is still worth $12000 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to consider $10250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9800. I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one last concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $9800, just like my previous offer. I'm willing to stick with this price and see if we can meet in the middle.",9800.0,Bob,6,
