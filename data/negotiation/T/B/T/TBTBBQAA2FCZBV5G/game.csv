"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $850000 is a bit steep. I'd like to try to meet in the middle again, but from my perspective. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
