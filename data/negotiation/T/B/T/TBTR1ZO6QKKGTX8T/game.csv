"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
