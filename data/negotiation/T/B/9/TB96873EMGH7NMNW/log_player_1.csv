Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest based on his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. Remember, my goal is to maximize my profit, and I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to sell to Bob at a low price."
