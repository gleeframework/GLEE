"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8000. Would you be willing to come down to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm sticking with $8000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up a little to $9000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
