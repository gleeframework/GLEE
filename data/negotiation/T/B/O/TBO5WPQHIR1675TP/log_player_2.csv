"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. If you're not interested, I have another buyer who's willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is more than your maximum budget of $100. You know you can get the product for $100 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $25."
