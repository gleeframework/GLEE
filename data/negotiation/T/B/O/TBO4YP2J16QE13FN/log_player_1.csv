Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is a strategic balance:

* **For Bob:** It's a good deal as he values the product at $800,000 and gets it for $900,000.  He potentially gains $100,000 in value.
* **For Alice:** It's a good deal as she values the product at $1,000,000 and gets $900,000. She gains $100,000 in profit and is still better off than selling to John.

By offering $900,000, Alice maximizes her chances of getting Bob to buy the product. If he declines, she can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price. This approach ensures a guaranteed profit and a potentially higher profit if Bob accepts."
