"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $135. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
