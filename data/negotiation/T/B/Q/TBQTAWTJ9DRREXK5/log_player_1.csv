Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob the product at a price of $120. I'm hoping to earn a bit of a premium for the product, but I'm not too far off from its true value to Bob.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is a bit too low for me, considering the product's true value to him is $100. I'm not going to accept his offer at this point.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to the true value of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 110}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $100, I'll increase my counteroffer by $5 to $105. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to Bob.

{""product_price"": 105}"
