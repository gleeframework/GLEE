"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000 again, but this is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,7,
