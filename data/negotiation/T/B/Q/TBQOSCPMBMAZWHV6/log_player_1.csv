Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a significantly higher price allows room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob might counter-offer or outright reject the initial price. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower your asking price.
* **Relationship Building:**  While aiming for the highest price, maintain a respectful and professional tone to foster a positive negotiation experience, even if it doesn't lead to a sale with Bob."
