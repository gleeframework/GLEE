"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make me an offer or buy it from me for $200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is overpriced at $200. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
