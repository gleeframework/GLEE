Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's quite a bit higher than I'm able to comfortably pay at this time. Given my current budget, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation and demonstrates my genuine interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $2,200,000 is a significant jump from your proposed $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

While I could try to push for more in the next round, Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. Accepting ensures I make the sale and don't risk him lowering his offer later."
