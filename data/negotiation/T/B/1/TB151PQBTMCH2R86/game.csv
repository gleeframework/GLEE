"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're sticking to your offer of $9,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll go down to $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm very close to my budget limit, and I'm going to have to stick to my offer of $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident that we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.
