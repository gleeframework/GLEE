{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good price as well. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is calculated to be a win-win. 

* **For Bob:**  It's $250,000 less than his maximum value, meaning he gets a good deal.
* **For Alice:** It's $250,000 more than her minimum value, securing a profit and exceeding the price John would pay.

This strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while maintaining a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
