"Hi Alice,  $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $9750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about $10000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
