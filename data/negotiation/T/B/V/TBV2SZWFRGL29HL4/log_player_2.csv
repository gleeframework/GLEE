"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a good fallback option with John, so there's no rush to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This allows for a potential compromise while also showing Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, as I might be able to get a price closer to my target. It's still better than buying from John at this stage, but there's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $50,000 lower than what John is offering.  Given that we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, it's not clear if further negotiation will result in a better price.  It's more efficient and less risky to purchase from John at this point, as his price is within my budget and the savings are minimal.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, but it's not worth the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
