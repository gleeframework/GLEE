Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a significant savings compared to my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. You should try to negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer and your persistence. $9500 is very close to what I need. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $9750 for the product. This way, we both get a fair deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750

Alice has come down significantly from her original price.  Accepting this offer saves you money compared to buying from John and represents a good compromise."
