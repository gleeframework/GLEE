Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $10,000. This allows me to be bolder in my initial offer to Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more receptive to a higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, I can always negotiate down, but I don't want to undervalue the product from the start."
