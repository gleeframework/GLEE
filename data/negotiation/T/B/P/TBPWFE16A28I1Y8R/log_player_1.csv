Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price of $120. While I know Bob values the product at $100, I'm hoping to push for my full value. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate, but I'm not giving up easily!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $100, and it's a step closer to my minimum price of $120. Hopefully, he'll see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to my minimum price of $120. While it's still not ideal, it's a good compromise and I'm willing to accept it.  I don't want to risk losing Bob completely and ending up with the lower price from John."
