"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as close to your target as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a good deal for Bob.  Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and getting the product for $1,250,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price."
