"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120. If you're open to that, I'm sure we can make a deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $120 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $140, so how about $130? It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
