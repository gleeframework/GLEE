Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your pricing and are willing to negotiate with Bob.  If you were to start at $10,000, there's no room for you to go up if Bob counters."
