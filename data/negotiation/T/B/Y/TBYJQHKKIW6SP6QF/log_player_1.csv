Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $12,000 allows for a couple of counteroffers from Bob before I have to consider John's offer. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in a discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** There's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if he's willing to compromise. 
* **Not yet desperate:** I haven't exhausted all options with Bob, so selling to John is premature."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not going to be too stubborn. $11,000 is a midpoint between his offer and my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob that the price is still a good deal for him, even though it's higher than he initially wanted to pay.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
