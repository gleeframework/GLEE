"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it's worth at least $10,000. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,250? Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
