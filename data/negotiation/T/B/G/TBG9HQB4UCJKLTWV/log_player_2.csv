"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $120.
* This is a good deal, but you can do better.
* You can buy the product from John for $150, but you are aiming to save as much money as possible.
*  Rejecting Alice's offer leaves you with the option of negotiating a lower price with Alice or buying from John."
