"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a significant offer on my end.",950000.0,Bob,4,
