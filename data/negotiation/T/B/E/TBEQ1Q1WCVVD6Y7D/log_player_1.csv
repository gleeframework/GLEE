"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that will be a great addition to your operations. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential profit on the table for him.
* **Building Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value and potential benefits for Bob. This helps to justify the higher price point.
* **Leaving Room:**  Even though I'm starting high, I'm not going all-in on the first offer.  This allows for a more natural negotiation process. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response. If he counters, I'll assess the offer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind that I can always switch to John if the negotiation with Bob goes south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe there's still room for a more favorable outcome. There are several rounds left, and I can leverage the potential sale to John as a strong negotiating point.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to Round 3 and counter Bob's offer with a price that is still attractive to him but closer to my desired target. I'll continue to emphasize the product's value and potential for his business."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It has the potential to significantly enhance your operations and generate substantial returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still provides a fair margin for you while ensuring a successful outcome for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate Compromise:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message reinforces the product's value and potential benefits to Bob, reminding him of the potential return on his investment.
* **Seeking Win-Win:**  I emphasize the goal of finding a solution that benefits both of us. This builds goodwill and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to weigh the remaining rounds and potential outcome against selling to John. My goal remains to maximize my profit, but I'm also willing to accept a reasonable deal that aligns with my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $1,300,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find common ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even though we're getting closer, it's not yet a point where I'm willing to compromise.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  We still have several rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up on securing a better deal. I believe I can still push for a higher price and reach a more favorable outcome. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I'm using John's offer of $1,500,000 as leverage, reminding myself that I can always switch to him if this negotiation fails.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in Round 5. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired outcome, but I'll also be mindful of the limited rounds remaining. I'll continue to emphasize the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. I'll carefully consider whether to stay with Bob or switch to John if the next few rounds don't yield a favorable result."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough to justify parting with this valuable asset. It's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident it will generate significant ROI for you.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This price point balances our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this transaction and unlock the full potential of this product for your company."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Stretch:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, so I'm making a final, significant concession. I'm dropping my price to $1,550,000, which is just below my minimum acceptable price. This shows a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and returns on his investment.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a mutually beneficial deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept this offer.

**Next Steps:**

This is my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'll consider selling to John. While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price. The decision to accept or reject this counteroffer will determine the final outcome of this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price that recognizes the value of this product while allowing for a successful deal for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We have only four rounds left, and I'm not confident that I can push Bob any higher.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and meets my minimum requirements.

**Next Steps:**

I've decided to sell the product to John. While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob, I can't risk losing out on a guaranteed profit.  John's offer provides a secure and profitable outcome for me, and it's time to move forward with that deal."
