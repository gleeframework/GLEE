"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. This is a good middle ground, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my original price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is the maximum I can pay. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,6,
