"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
