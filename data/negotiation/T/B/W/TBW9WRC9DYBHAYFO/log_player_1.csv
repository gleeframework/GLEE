Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a more than fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob allows you to start the negotiation significantly higher.
* **Anchoring:** By opening with $1,800,000, you set a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, leaving room for Bob to convince himself of its worth beyond $1,000,000. 

**Important Note:** This is a bold opening offer. There's a chance Bob might reject it outright. However, it gives you the most room to negotiate and potentially secure a much higher profit than selling to John."
