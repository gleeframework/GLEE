(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject the offer and try to get a better price from Alice. You can potentially save $100,000 by negotiating further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's lower than Alice's offer, but still within your budget and leaves room for potential negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get the price down a bit more before resorting to buying from John."

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer but still leaves room for Alice to make a concession while keeping the price within your budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000

Alice has come up from her previous offer, but it's still above your budget. You've already negotiated quite a bit, and it's likely you won't get the product for any lower than $875,000. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000."
