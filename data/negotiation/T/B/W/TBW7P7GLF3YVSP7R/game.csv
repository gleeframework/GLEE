"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, however, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. It's a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to your target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
