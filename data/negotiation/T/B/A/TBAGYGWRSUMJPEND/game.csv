,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? I believe this would still allow us to reach a fair deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still not able to meet the $1,050,000 price point. I am willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range and allows us to come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
