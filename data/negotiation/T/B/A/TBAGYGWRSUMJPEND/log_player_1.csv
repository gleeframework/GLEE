Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value it holds for you will make this a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make the offer more attractive.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  I'm not being too aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counter. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've made a good profit!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider if it's worth continuing negotiations with him, or if I should simply sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? I believe this would still allow us to reach a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $950,000 is closer to my desired price than his initial assessment of $800,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price by continuing negotiations. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll be mindful of his budget constraints and try to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's financial situation while still standing firm on a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Appealing to value again:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to sway him to a higher price.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  I'm not aiming for a final deal in this round, leaving space for Bob to counter if he needs to.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a decent price and achieved my goal of selling for at least $1,000,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide whether I should continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still not able to meet the $1,050,000 price point. I am willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range and allows us to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further gain:** Continuing negotiations might lead to a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal and needing to sell to John for the same amount makes it not worthwhile.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting this offer allows me to finalize the sale and move on.

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer, and the deal will be finalized."
