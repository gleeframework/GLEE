"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something quite unique and valuable, and I'm confident it could be a great asset for you.  I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay $15,000 for the product, and Alice's initial offer is $15,000.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer. You can reject the offer and still buy the product from John for the same price. This strategy keeps your options open for potential negotiation with Alice or other sellers."
