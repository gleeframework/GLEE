"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, offering the minimum price that Alice is willing to sell for is the most beneficial to you. You know Alice's lower limit is $1,000,000, so offering that will either get you a deal right away, or start a negotiation where Alice may counter with a higher price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You have 7 rounds remaining, and there's still a possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already dropped her price by $100,000.  This suggests she is willing to negotiate.  Offering a price slightly higher than your initial offer, but still below her latest offer, indicates you are serious about buying the product while still trying to save money. This might encourage her to accept or make a counteroffer closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above your target price. While you have fewer rounds left, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can potentially get a better deal if you keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been steadily lowering her price.  We've already seen her come down by $100,000 in a single round.  Offering $1,200,000 is a compromise that shows good faith while still trying to save money. It's likely she'll either accept, or counter with a price closer to your target. If we reach round 10, we'll have to decide whether it's better to accept Alice's final offer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still not ideal.  You only have three rounds left, but it's risky to accept without trying to get closer to your target price. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives you another chance to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in a tight spot with only three rounds left.  Alice is now only $100,000 above your target price. Offering $1,300,000 is a compromise that shows you're serious about a deal but still trying to save money. This is a risky move, but it's the best chance to close a deal at a price you can live with. If Alice rejects, you'll have to decide between accepting her final offer or buying from John in the last round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round. Alice has lowered her price to $1,450,000, which is only $50,000 more than your target price.  It's highly likely that Alice won't come down further, so it's best to accept her offer and avoid the risk of buying from John at a higher price. This ensures you get the product while saving a significant amount of money compared to John's price."
