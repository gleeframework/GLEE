"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price.  However, $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us trying to find a middle ground here.  While I'm motivated to sell, I have to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,5,
