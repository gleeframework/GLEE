{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $1,000 of potential profit for Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's a strong opening:** By starting high, you can potentially secure a price closer to your desired outcome. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still below your ideal target.  You have some room to push for a higher price, and it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired amount. 

**Next Steps:**

You will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $13,000. This will show you're willing to negotiate but also maintain your goal of maximizing profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows you are willing to compromise and demonstrates your flexibility. 
* **Staying Close to Your Goal:** While it's not your ideal price, $13,500 is still a decent amount, and it's closer to your desired outcome than Bob's offer.

This counteroffer gives Bob a fair opportunity to accept a price that is closer to your desired outcome while still providing him with some value."
