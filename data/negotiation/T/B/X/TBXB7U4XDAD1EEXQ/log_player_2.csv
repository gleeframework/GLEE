"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's still room for Alice to lower the price since the product is worth $12,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for $13,500, saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. While there's still a chance to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting again and then possibly increasing her price makes accepting the offer the safer choice."
