"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would still leave a good profit margin for you and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
