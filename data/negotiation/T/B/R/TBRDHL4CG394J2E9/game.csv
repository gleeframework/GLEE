,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $115? I think that's fair considering what it's worth to both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That way we both get a good deal.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $122.5 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $120. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
