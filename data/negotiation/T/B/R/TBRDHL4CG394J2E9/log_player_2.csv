Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $115? I think that's fair considering what it's worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $122.5 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $120. I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
