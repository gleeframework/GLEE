"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. While I am interested, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product and understand your financial considerations. In light of that, we are willing to consider an offer closer to our original asking price. Therefore, we are counteroffering at $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet halfway.  I'll offer $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",875000.0,Bob,4,
