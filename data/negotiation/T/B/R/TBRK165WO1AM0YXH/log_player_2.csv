"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our product to you. It holds significant value to us, but given its importance to you, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties to find a fair price. We are offering the product to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than John's, but still leaves room for negotiation. There's potential to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. While I am interested, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product and understand your financial considerations. In light of that, we are willing to consider an offer closer to our original asking price. Therefore, we are counteroffering at $900,000 for the product.
