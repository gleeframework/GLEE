"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $10,000 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. I am offering this exceptional product to you for $9,500. I hope we can work together to make this transaction successful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is already quite good, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer politely and making a counteroffer, I might be able to secure an even better price without risking a deal with John, who's offering the product at my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer! I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to find something closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By suggesting a price of $8,000, I'm aiming for a significant discount while still leaving room for negotiation. My message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, increasing the chances of a positive response.  This strategy allows me to potentially get a great deal without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product and our aim to reach a fair agreement, I propose a price of $8,500 for the product. This is a middle ground between our previous offers, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while accommodating your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice met me right in the middle of our previous offers. This is a good price, saving me $1,500 from my initial maximum and $1,500 from John's offer. There's a small chance I could get the price lower, but it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a good price and ends the negotiation."
