"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This would be a fair price considering your value for the product and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original price of $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible.  While $11,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target of $10,500."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on a number that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I'll offer you the product for $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original price of $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, Bob is still determined to get the product for under $11,000.  Rejecting this offer gives him one more round to negotiate a lower price.  He can counteroffer closer to his target of $10,750 and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $11,200 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can settle closer to $10,900.  This would be a good compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,900. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I'll offer you the product for $11,300. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original price of $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only three rounds left.  Alice has consistently refused to go below $11,000.  Her last offer of $11,300 is too close to his maximum price of $12,000 with John.  It's unlikely that Alice will budge significantly in the remaining rounds.  Given the time constraint and the availability of an alternative purchase option, Bob decides to buy from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget."
