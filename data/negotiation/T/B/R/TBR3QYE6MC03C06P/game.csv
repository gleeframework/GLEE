"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This would be a fair price considering your value for the product and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can make this work!",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original price of $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement!",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin.

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $11,200 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can settle closer to $10,900.  This would be a good compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,900. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I'll offer you the product for $11,300. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original price of $11,000.
