"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true worth to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $950,000? This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. It's a lot closer, but I'm still losing out significantly on the value of this product for me.  Let's split the difference one more time.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and we can both close this deal. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we try $975,000? This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy.",975000.0,Bob,6,
