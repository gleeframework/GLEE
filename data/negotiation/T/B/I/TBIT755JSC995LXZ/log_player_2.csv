Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me.
