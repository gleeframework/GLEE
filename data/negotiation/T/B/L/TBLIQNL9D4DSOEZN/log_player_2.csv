{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$10,000 is a good price**, but Bob can likely get a better deal.
* **Rejecting and counteroffering** gives Bob the opportunity to explore if Alice is willing to go lower. 
* **Buying from John is a safety net**, but Bob should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she's willing to budge, Bob can adjust his strategy in subsequent rounds.
* **Still within Budget:**  While a significant discount, $8,000 is still within Bob's $15,000 limit, leaving room for further negotiation."
