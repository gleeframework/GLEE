"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. How about we discuss a price closer to $1,100,000? I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I see that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $1,250,000 is quite high given the current market conditions and the fact that you're the only seller. Could we perhaps aim for $1,200,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
