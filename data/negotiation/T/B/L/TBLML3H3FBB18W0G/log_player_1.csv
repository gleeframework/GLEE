Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $80, so any price below that is an automatic win for him.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John if Bob refuses.

Therefore, offering the product at $95 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Perspective:** He gets the product for $15 less than his perceived value, making it an attractive deal.
* **Alice's Perspective:** She earns $15 more than selling to John, maximizing her profit."
