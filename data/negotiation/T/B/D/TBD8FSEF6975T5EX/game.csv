"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $14,000 for the product. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
