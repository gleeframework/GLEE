"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He should aim for a price closer to his limit of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $14,000 for the product. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for Bob, and he's already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  He's unlikely to get Alice to come down to his price range.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, making it the most sensible option."
