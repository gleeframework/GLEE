"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, this offer is above his perceived value but still within the realm of possibility.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium to get the product immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price, especially since I have multiple rounds left. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit margin.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not ready to settle for Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better price, especially since I have several rounds remaining. I will counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's significantly closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to entice Bob to accept. If he rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000. While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's not enough to make me deviate from my goal of earning at least $15,000. Selling to John guarantees I meet my minimum target and ensures a quick and hassle-free transaction."
