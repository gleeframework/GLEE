"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This still reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1700000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1400000. This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about buying your product, but it's also the highest I can realistically pay. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
