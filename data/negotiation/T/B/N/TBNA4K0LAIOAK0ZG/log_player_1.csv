Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is above my minimum of $80, and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's below what he was willing to pay initially.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $85.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a fair price, and it's better than selling to John for $80. There's always a chance I could continue negotiating, but the risk of Bob walking away completely or John's offer expiring makes this the most sensible choice."
