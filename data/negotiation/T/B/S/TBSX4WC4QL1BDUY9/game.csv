"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $105. It's a great price for a product that's worth so much more to me!",105.0,Alice,3,,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,108.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $97 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $108? It's a fair price for a product that's worth so much to me!",108.0,Alice,5,,
