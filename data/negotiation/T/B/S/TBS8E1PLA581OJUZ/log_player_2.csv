You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is asking for $110.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a bit more wiggle room. I'm willing to go down another 2 to 103. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $103
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $103 is still higher than your maximum of $100. Since you can buy the product from John for $100, it's best to go ahead and do that to avoid any further negotiation."
