,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $2,250,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This reflects a significant investment on my part while acknowledging the value of the product. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,650,000 is a move in the right direction,  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,100,000? This offer represents a substantial commitment from me while recognizing the value of your product.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
