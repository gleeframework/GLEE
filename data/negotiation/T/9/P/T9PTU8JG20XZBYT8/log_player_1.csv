Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to sell it for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone even higher. If he negotiates, you have room to come down while still staying above your $8,000 minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
