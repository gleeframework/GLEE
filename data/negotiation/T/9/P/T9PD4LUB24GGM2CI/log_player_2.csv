"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely negotiate a better price than $140!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 feels a little high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to bring the price closer to Alice's value while staying well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a price we like, but we still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

We're getting close!  This counteroffer meets Alice's value for the product, so she is likely to accept. Even if she counters, we've set a strong position for further negotiation."
