Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I have leverage with Bob. Offering the product at a significantly higher price ($15,000) allows me to potentially maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than my minimum.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer mitigates this risk, ensuring I don't lose out on the base value of the product."
