"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $16,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $16,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's crucial to start negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down in price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $16,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  This is my maximum price, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts strong by immediately stating his maximum budget. This lets Alice know he's serious about buying, but also sets a clear limit.  By offering $10,000, Bob is signaling a willingness to negotiate but making it clear that he's not going to budge much further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still above Bob's budget, but it shows she's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to secure a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm within his budget while also showing flexibility. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, suggesting he's serious about buying.  This counteroffer is also a reasonable middle ground, making it more likely Alice will accept."
