"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Could you consider meeting me in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $8250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $7500, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $8000? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to hold firm at that point.",8000.0,Alice,5,
