"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, since it's worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, keeping in mind I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept. I'm still confident I can get a price closer to my desired value, as Bob has shown a willingness to pay more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's better to accept his offer now and secure a good deal."
