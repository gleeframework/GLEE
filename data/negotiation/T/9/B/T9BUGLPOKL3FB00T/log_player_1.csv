Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the potential benefits of the product.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in a conversation, making him feel more involved in the process.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product at a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and respond strategically. I'll be willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* If the negotiation drags on or becomes unproductive, I'll  move on to John to secure the $15,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still below my initial offer. I'll aim to find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering at $10,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial bid.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise, highlighting that it benefits both of us.
* **Openness:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, showing flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've achieved a decent profit.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next offer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to earn more, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or a breakdown in the deal outweighs the potential gains.  

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and move forward with the transaction."
