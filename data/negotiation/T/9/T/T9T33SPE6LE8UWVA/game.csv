"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to consider $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,000?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
