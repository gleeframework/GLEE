"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Is this something you'd like to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product for her minimum price, which is also significantly lower than John's price. There's no point in negotiating further as it risks losing the deal."
