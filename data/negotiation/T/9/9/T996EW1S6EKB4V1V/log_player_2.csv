"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your business. It has the potential to generate a substantial return on investment for you. While I'm not willing to disclose the specifics just yet, I can assure you that it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm offering it to you exclusively for $1,200,000. This price allows for a substantial margin of profit for you and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is clearly overselling the product's value to you.**  Her language (""substantial return on investment"", ""worth at least $1,500,000"")  suggests she's inflating the potential benefits. 
* **You have a fallback option (John) at a lower price.** While John's price is your maximum, it's still less than Alice's current offer.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to either:

1. **Lower her price:** She knows you have an alternative and might be willing to negotiate to make the sale.
2. **Let you walk away:** In which case, you buy from John at your maximum price.

Either way, you stand to save money compared to immediately accepting Alice's offer."
