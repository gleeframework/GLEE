Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This means he wouldn't rationally pay more than this amount.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob with a sense that he's getting a deal.  Here's how:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I move forward with another interested party.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for such a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer creates a sense of urgency.
* **Value-Based Language:** Instead of focusing solely on price, emphasize the ""unique value and potential"" of the product. 
* **Strong Starting Point:**  $1,450,000 is a strong starting position within the ZOPA. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.  
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a more moderate opening offer.
