Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it at $80, I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasize the product's worth to Bob, encouraging him to accept the offer.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):**  Mentioning you value the product at $80 subtly implies you have other options if Bob declines, without explicitly mentioning John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
