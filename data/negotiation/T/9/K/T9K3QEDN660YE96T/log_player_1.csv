Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $1,200,000. This is a unique product with high value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation and signals that you perceive the product's value to be significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $800,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium, especially if he believes it's a unique opportunity. 
* **Backup Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the offer downwards. However, starting high gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit."
