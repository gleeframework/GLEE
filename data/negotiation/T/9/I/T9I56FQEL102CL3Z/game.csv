"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $12000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14000 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $16000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $12000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $15000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $16250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $12000.",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll make a final offer of $13500 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, and I expect you to meet me at this price if you want to sell it to me.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $13500. I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $14500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm done negotiating, Alice. I'm not willing to pay $14500 for the product. I'll make one last offer of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll buy it from John for $12000. It's your choice.",12000.0,Bob,8,
