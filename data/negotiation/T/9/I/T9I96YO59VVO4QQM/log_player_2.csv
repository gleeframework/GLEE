"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its exceptional features and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true value and provides a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $600,000."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the $600,000 mark doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential this product holds.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $950,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. I want to make this work and feel we're getting closer. To be transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $875,000.  This accounts for its true worth and the value it brings. If you're able to meet me at this point, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her absolute minimum price is $875,000. Since your maximum budget is $800,000, there's no room left for negotiation with Alice.  It's time to cut your losses and go with your backup option: John, who will sell you the product for $800,000."
