"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and $800,000 to Alice. There is a large gap between their values, meaning there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $950,000, which is still a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers you a significant return on your investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

While $1,025,000 is a better deal than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
