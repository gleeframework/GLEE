"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $950,000, which is still a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers you a significant return on your investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $987,500. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",987500.0,Bob,4,
