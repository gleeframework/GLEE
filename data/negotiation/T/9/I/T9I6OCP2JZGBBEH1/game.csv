"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves you a substantial profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000.  That's a good middle ground, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
