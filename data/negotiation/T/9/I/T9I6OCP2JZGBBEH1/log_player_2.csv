"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting (it's below your maximum value), there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price.  You can likely get it for closer to your target of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves you a substantial profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to buy the product for as close to my desired $1,000,000 as possible. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price."
