"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's $800,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his limit, but still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $850,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal. This counteroffer leaves some room for Alice to potentially accept, while also setting a clear boundary for Bob's maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his $800,000 limit. Since Bob only has 10 rounds to reach a deal, rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and potentially a better deal can be reached before exhausting all rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his willingness to compromise while still remaining within his desired price range.  $875,000 is a reasonable middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's most recent offer, and may entice Alice to accept.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $800,000.  While it's still above his target, it's a significant improvement from previous offers and shows a willingness to compromise from Alice. Accepting this offer ensures that Bob can buy the product while still saving a considerable amount of money compared to Alice's initial price.  There is a risk that he could negotiate a lower price in subsequent rounds, but the potential for saving an additional $85,000 is not worth the risk of potentially losing the deal altogether."
