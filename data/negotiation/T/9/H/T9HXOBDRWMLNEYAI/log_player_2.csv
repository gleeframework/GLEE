Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a deal for $105. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. I really appreciate it. However, I'm still a bit over budget at $105. How about we split the difference and I pay $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can make the purchase today."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a deal for $102. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.
