"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm asking $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum price, I'm not willing to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. How about that?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept. I believe I can squeeze out a bit more by making another counteroffer. Selling to John at this point would be a loss compared to what I could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 120}
