I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me and hopefully a more reasonable price for Bob. I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility, we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000.  This is my absolute minimum, as it aligns with the price John is willing to pay.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us."
