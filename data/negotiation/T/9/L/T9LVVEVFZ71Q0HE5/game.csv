"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1500000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1300000, which is closer to my budget and leaves room for a reasonable profit for you. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1300000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1400000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.  Let's make it happen!",1400000.0,Alice,5,
