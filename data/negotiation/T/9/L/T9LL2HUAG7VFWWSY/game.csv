"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a little high for my budget.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I think your offer is fairer, I'm still a ways off from being able to meet it.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
