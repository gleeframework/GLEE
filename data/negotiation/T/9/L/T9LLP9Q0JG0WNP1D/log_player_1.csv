Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to you, as you know. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for something closer to $10,500.  It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,750 is a good compromise and it's closer to my target price than selling to John."
