"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to you, as you know. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are more rounds to negotiate, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price.  This shows Bob is serious about buying but is also looking for a good deal.  This approach allows for room to negotiate in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for something closer to $10,500.  It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a lower price than Alice's previous offer, it's still significantly higher than Bob's ideal price.  There are still rounds remaining, and Bob can potentially get an even better deal.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob is not desperate enough to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price that is closer to Alice's offer, but still within his acceptable range. This approach shows that Bob is willing to compromise and is serious about buying the product. By splitting the difference, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway and potentially close the deal."
