It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is closer to your limit, it's still more than John's price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice one more time."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $88, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $90.  How about we settle at $89? That's a small compromise on both sides and lets us make a deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $89 is only $1 less than John's offer of $80.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point.  It's better to go with John and secure the product for $80."
