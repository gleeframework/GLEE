Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially make more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $120.  I'll counter with a price closer to $115 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we go to $108? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $108.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $100 and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
