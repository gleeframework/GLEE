Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Time pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

By starting with a higher offer, you give yourself the best chance to negotiate a higher final price, exceeding your minimum and maximizing your potential earnings."
