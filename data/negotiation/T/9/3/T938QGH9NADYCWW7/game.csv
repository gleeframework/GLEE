"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. It's a significant underestimation of the product's value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too far off from what I can accept. Let's try $1,125,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and we can both move forward with the transaction.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems we are getting closer.  I can do $1,100,000 to get this deal done.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
