"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a little lower than what I think it's worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $135?  It's a good price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $150, and it gets me closer to my goal of earning as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a fair price. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get $135, Bob is firm on $130, and I've already rejected his offer once.  It's better to close the deal for $130 than risk further negotiations and potentially end up selling to John for $120."
