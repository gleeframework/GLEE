Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation while aiming for a much larger profit.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** By inviting questions and discussion, you signal flexibility while keeping the ultimate decision in your hands. 

**Worst-Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer. You still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, meeting your minimum acceptable price."
