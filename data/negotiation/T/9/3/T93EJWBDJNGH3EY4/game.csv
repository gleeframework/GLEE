"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $7,500. I'm willing to come down slightly, but how about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This price still allows me a decent margin while also giving you a good deal. Let's find common ground.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $7,750. Can you consider this price?",7750.0,Bob,4,
