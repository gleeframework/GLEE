"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it.
