Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for my product. How about we meet at $11,000? It's a compromise that allows both of us to come away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice seems stuck at $11,000. It's unlikely she'll go down significantly from there.  It's better to secure the product from John at $10,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time in negotiations with Alice."
