"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This seems fair considering your own valuation and my budget.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm still not willing to go that low, considering the product's value to me. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
