# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Since you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for you to get a better deal.  Let's see what kind of counteroffer we can get from her!"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

While Alice's offer is tempting and closer to your desired price, it's still slightly above your limit.  It's worth trying to see if we can push her a bit further.  We can counter with a slightly higher offer and hopefully find a sweet spot."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm still not willing to go that low, considering the product's value to me. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still over your budget.  You've made your best efforts to negotiate, and there's no guarantee she'll go lower.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
