"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think you'll be very pleased with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $14,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a very fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob wants to see if he can get it for even lower, especially with only 7 rounds left.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.  My final offer is $12,750. This is a great price considering the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $12,750 is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000. 
* **Rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Compromise:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield a small reduction in price, potentially not worth the risk.

Bob should accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
