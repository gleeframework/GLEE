Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price with Alice, it's becoming increasingly unlikely.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, Bob should buy it from John to save any further risk of overpaying."
