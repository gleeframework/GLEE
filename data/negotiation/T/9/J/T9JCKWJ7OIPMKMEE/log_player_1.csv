Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can start high with Bob.  
* **Room for negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Value-based language:**  The message focuses on the benefit to Bob rather than just stating a price, increasing the chance he'll be willing to pay more than his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a different price and adjust your approach based on Bob's response if you were able to have multiple interactions."
