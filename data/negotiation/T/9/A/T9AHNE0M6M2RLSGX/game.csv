"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $170 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price!",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $145. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",145.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $152.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal!",152.5,Alice,5,
