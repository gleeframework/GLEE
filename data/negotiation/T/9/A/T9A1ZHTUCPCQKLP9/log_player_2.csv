"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason: While $110 is close to your budget, there's room for negotiation to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! The product looks great, but I'm working with a bit of a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

Reason: This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for Alice to counter and potentially reach a price agreeable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice is negotiating, which is good.  While $105 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to get closer to $90. You're very close to John's price, so the risk of pushing Alice away is countered by the guarantee of getting it from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to purchase if you're happy with it."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

Reason: This counteroffer aims to split the difference between the last two offers. It shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'll be happy to sell it to you at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice has met your ideal price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John, as you've achieved the best possible outcome."
