"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to come down much further and it's not worth the risk of her raising her price again.  It's better to secure the $12,000 price with John."
