"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be a fair price.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $11,000? That's a pretty good compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering your offer, I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $13,500. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
