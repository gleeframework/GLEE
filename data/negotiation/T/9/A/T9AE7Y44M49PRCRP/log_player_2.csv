{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 16.7% discount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about a deal, but also sets a clear starting point for negotiation. I'm confident that I can secure a better price than Alice's initial offer, but I'm also mindful of the limited rounds and the alternative option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can secure a lower price. I'm committed to getting the best deal possible, so I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum budget. This is a serious offer and a strong indication of my willingness to close the deal.  If Alice rejects this, I'll be forced to buy from John, but I'm hoping she recognizes the value of a quick deal."
