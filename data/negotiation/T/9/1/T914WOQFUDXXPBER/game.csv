"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  That gives us both a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $87.50.  It's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $89. This is the best I can do, and it's still a good value for you. ",89.0,Alice,5,
