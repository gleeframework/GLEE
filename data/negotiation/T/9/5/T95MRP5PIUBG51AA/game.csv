"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal considering the value it holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to take it down to $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth the investment.",9500.0,Alice,5,
