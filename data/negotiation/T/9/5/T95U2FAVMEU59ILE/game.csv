"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's still a great value for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Let's split the difference and go with $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get the best price I can for this product. I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,7,
