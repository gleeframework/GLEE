Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1000000 is still slightly above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my price range. Let's finalize this transaction and make it happen.

While $925,000 is a tempting offer, it still doesn't meet my minimum requirement.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob once more.  If he rejects that, I'll go with John's offer."
