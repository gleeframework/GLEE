"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget. While it's a discount from the product's true value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if a lower price can be reached."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's work together to find a solution.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further. There's a good chance she might be willing to compromise further to close the deal, especially since she rejected Bob's initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,000,000 is still slightly above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my price range. Let's finalize this transaction and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $925000 is still below my acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $975000, but this is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, $975,000 is still above Bob's desired price range.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has made it clear that $975,000 is her final offer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice and potentially losing the product altogether.  Buying from John for $800,000 is the safest and most cost-effective option."
