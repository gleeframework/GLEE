"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  Would you consider $500,000? I think that would be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer of $500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $600,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $650,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $625,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $675,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're reaching the limit:**  With each round, Alice is getting closer to her minimum, and we're running out of rounds to negotiate a significantly better price.
* **Diminishing returns:** The difference between our offers is getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal than $675,000 at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push Alice risks her walking away, forcing us to buy from John at $1,000,000. Accepting her offer guarantees a saving of $325,000. 

While we might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal, it's a risky move for potentially minimal gain. Accepting the $675,000 offer is the safest option to secure a good price."
