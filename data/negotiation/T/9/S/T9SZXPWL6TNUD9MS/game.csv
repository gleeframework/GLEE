,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $13500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $14000, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob, but I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $13800, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",13800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13800, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $13500. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",13500.0,Bob,10,
