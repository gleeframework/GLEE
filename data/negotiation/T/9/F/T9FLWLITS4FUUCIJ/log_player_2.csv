# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10,500.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value this product holds for you.
