"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that allows you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This would allow us both to reach a compromise and move forward with the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
