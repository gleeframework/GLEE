{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the return you'll see on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Anchoring bias:**  By starting at $1,800,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher than $1,200,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This price allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land a deal significantly higher than your fallback option. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and any information you glean during your negotiation."
