{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value, but I'm also willing to negotiate. This price allows for some room to lower the price if Bob counter-offers, but it also allows me to potentially earn a good profit. If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I'm still unable to meet at $11,000. I believe $9,500 would be a fair compromise for both of us. I hope this offer aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm unwilling to go that low. I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, which is significantly more profitable. Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
