"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $130 for it.  What do you say?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $132.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",132.0,Bob,4,
