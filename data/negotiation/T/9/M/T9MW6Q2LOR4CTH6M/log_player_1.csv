"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a comfortable margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob, who values the product at $10,000.  I'm hoping to secure a good price early on, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better price with some negotiation.  I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is a slight concession from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value and closer to what Bob is willing to pay.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
