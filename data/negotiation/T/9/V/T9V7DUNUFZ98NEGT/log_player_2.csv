"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get the price down further, saving myself more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good compromise.  It's still within my budget and saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the deal at a reasonable price."
