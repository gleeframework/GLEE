"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price with the product's ""potential,"" suggesting there may be aspects of value Bob hasn't fully considered. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm signaling that I'm open to discussion and potential adjustments to the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll aim to bring him closer to my target without losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the price you proposed is a little too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,750,000 reflects that.  Are you open to discussing this further?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Hold Firm:** I'm moving down from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but not drastically. The $1,750,000 counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's initial offer and comfortably above my minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially nudge his perception closer to mine.
* **Open Communication:** Ending with an open-ended question encourages continued negotiation and keeps the dialogue flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I understand the value of the product, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and represents a significant increase from his initial offer. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the potential of losing the deal entirely."
