You can save money by rejecting the offer and counteroffering.  The product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to offer $95 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $95 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. That still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for this item.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice has come down to $105, which is still within your budget and a better price than John's offer. It's a good deal, so accept it!"
