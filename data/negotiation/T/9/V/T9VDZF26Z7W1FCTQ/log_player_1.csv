Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, potentially making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to offer $95 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept that low of an offer just yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $95 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. That still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for this item.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
