"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $120.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the same product from John for $150, so I'd rather wait and save some money.
