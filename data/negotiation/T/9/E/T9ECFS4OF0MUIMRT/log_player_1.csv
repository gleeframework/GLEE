Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 sets a strong initial point. It's below my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" to entice Bob and justify the high price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I encourage a dialogue and potential counter-offer.  

**Goal:** 
My ideal outcome is for Bob to accept this initial offer. If he counters, I have some room to negotiate down slightly while still exceeding my minimum selling price. This strategy maximizes my potential profit while keeping Bob engaged."
