"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be reasonable.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand that $18,000 is high, but $6,000 is far below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
