Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
 ""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving us a strong negotiating position. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with $925,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can still sell to John for our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving Bob with a perceived gain from the deal."
