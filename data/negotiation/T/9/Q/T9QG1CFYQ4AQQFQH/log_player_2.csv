"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $15,000 is well over your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and we'll see how Alice responds.  If she rejects, I can adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $12,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still below Alice's last offer and within my budget, but it's a step closer to meeting her halfway. If she rejects this offer, I'll have to consider the risk of buying from John."
