"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $130. Is that something you'd be interested in?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit above what I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $132.50. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132.50 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $128? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us both within our respective budgets.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to come down to $131, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for the value this product brings to you.",131.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $131 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $129.50. That way, we both get a fair deal, and I can finally get my hands on this product.",129.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",130.0,Alice,7,
