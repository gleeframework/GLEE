"I understand your perspective, Bob.  To be frank, $2,000,000 is my ideal target, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement. Considering your budget, how about we meet halfway at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we discuss $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is close, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $1,750,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Would you be willing to consider that figure?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
