Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's a bit above the middle ground, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet at $13,000. It's a fair price that's still below the $15,000 value you placed on the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower, and $13,000 is a reasonable price saving $2,000 compared to John's offer."
