"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is starting at $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can always buy from John, but it's better to try and save money if possible."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer is $150,000 lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $1,050,000 is still well above Alice's minimum, leaving room for her to come down.
* **Positive Tone:**  While making a counteroffer, I'm still maintaining a positive and respectful tone."
