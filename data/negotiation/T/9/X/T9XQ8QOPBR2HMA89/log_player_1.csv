Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000? That's the highest I can go for this product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

This offer is closer to my minimum price, and there are only 6 rounds left. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal, especially considering John's offer."
