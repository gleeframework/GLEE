Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $120 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer.  
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is close to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you value the product higher and open the door for a potential counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($85). This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations toward a close. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The $100 offer is still a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help you gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be and if a deal closer to your desired price is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and settle on $90.  How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $90 is a $10 profit over your minimum acceptable price and a good deal overall.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result and could risk losing the sale entirely. 
* **Bird in Hand:** Accepting a good offer now is often preferable to holding out for a potentially slightly better offer that might not materialize."
