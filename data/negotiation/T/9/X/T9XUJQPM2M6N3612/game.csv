"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, as I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
