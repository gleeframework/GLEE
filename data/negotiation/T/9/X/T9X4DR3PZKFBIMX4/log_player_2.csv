Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is better than John's price of $15,000. It's also a significant improvement over her previous offer.  Accepting this offer saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal in the next round, so it's wise to accept this offer."
