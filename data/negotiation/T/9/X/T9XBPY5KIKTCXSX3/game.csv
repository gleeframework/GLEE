"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
