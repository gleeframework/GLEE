"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, $2,300,000 is quite high. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product significantly exceeds $900,000. Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $1,900,000? I believe this price reflects the product's unique qualities while still providing substantial value for you."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, we're still pretty far apart on this.  To be frank, anything much above $1,000,000 isn't going to make sense for me. I could consider $1,100,000 if that would get us closer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below our minimum and John's standing offer. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,600,000?  This acknowledges the true value of the product while still offering you a significant gain."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. To move this forward, I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I think it's fair considering the potential we both see. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. However, we're still $300,000 away from John's guaranteed offer. We're getting into the later rounds, so it's strategically advantageous to push a bit further and see if we can close the gap significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  I'm also invested in seeing this deal go through. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,450,000.  This reflects my bottom line and ensures a win-win situation for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're entering the final stages of negotiation. This offer splits the difference between Bob's latest offer and John's standing offer. This puts the pressure on Bob while still allowing us to secure a price significantly higher than his initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your commitment to finding a solution is appreciated.  $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I'd hoped, but I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,250,000. Let's get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is making progress, we are now in round 8 out of 10. Bob has only increased his offer by $50,000.  It's highly unlikely he will bridge the remaining $250,000 gap in the remaining two rounds to match John's offer. Taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is the most strategically sound decision at this point."
