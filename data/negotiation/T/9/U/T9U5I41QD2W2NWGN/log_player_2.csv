"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it would be incredibly valuable to your business.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's better than John's price, there's definitely room for negotiation. It's worthwhile to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential impact on your business. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial offer, it's still a bit too high. There's still some wiggle room, and I can try to get closer to my ideal price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us and a significant step closer to a deal. Let's try to close this."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to finalize this deal, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,140,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her offer is now closer to my target price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away or I might run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer allows me to get the product for a good price within my budget."
