"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  Let's try $16,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $18,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a 5-year warranty and a free consultation. I think that's worth considering. The price remains at $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but the price is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $16,500. It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",16500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I think the extras I'm offering are worth the extra $500. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,7,
