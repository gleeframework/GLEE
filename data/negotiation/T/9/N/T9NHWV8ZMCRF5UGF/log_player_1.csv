{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be confident and positive in my message, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $90 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $90.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but unfortunately, my budget only allows me to pay up to $88 for the product. I hope this offer is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'd prefer to make more money, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with an even lower price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100, as that's a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
