"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point while still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at a higher price than my minimum, but I'm not overplaying my hand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'd rather sell to Bob than John, $8,000 is simply not acceptable. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $12,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept. If he doesn't, I can still sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $9,000 is still not enough.  I'm going to reject his offer again and try to push for my minimum.  If he continues to refuse, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $11,000.  I'm willing to compromise a little, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price of $12,000. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would like to get more than $12,000 for the product, Bob is showing little flexibility in his negotiating stance. We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm concerned that he will continue to refuse any price above $10,000.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price, and with limited rounds remaining, it's the safest option."
