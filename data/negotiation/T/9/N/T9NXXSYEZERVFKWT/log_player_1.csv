Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **50% Markup:**  The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from Bob's perceived value. While this is ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Confident Language:** The message uses confident language (""exclusive opportunity,"" ""immense value"") to subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** This offer is a starting point. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer and be ready to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Buyers:** Don't be afraid to walk away from the deal if Bob isn't willing to meet a price that's significantly above your $1,500,000 guarantee with John."
