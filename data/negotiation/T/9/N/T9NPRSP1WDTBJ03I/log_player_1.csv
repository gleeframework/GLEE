"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This allows room for negotiation and I believe Bob will likely counteroffer. It's important to try and gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with $8,500. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum of $8,000. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to $8,000.  There are still rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $7,500. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $6,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. It's getting late in the game, but I think there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $7,000.  This is getting close to John's offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and finally agree. Time is running out, but I want to try and close the deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the time is running out. While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not ideal. Selling to John guarantees me $8,000, which is above my minimum and a safe bet considering the limited time remaining."
