"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It has a market value of over $1.2 million, and I'm confident it's a great investment. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can you meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your interest, $1000000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1250000.  This still offers you a great value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price point.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $1150000. Can you consider this price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
