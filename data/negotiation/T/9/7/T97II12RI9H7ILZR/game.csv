"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $85? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not sure $85 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85. How about $77.50?,77.5,Bob,4,
