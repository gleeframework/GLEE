"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While $750,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be well worth the investment for you. ",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than my target price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $800,000. This price represents a fair value for the product and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make it happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
