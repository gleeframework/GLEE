Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, even exceeding the price I'm offering it to you for. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value being even higher than the asking price, potentially making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price (though still ideally above your minimum).

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this price. If he rejects it, you can always offer a lower price in a subsequent message, keeping in mind your $15,000 safety net with John."
