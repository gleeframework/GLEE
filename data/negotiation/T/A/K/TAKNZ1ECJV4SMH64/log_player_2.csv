"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could potentially get the product for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer, there's also the risk she won't go any lower. Accepting her offer at $14,000 guarantees you save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
