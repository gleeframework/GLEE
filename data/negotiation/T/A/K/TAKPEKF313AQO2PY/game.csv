,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value proposition.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you suggested doesn't fully reflect the product's unique capabilities and the long-term return on investment it offers. To meet in the middle, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay up to $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your budget constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,800,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings to your specific needs.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from the price I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a final offer of $1,500,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to move forward with the purchase.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
