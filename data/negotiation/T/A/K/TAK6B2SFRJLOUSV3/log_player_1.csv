{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I can potentially get a good profit, but also leaves room for negotiation. It's high enough to be appealing to Bob, but not so high that he's immediately going to reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my preferred price, and it's a good deal for me. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit that's higher than selling to John."
