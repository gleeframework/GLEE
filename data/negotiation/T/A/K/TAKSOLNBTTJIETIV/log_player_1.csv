"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation. Selling to John would result in the same price, but accepting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open for potential future deals."
