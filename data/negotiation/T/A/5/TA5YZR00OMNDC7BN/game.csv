"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,800,000 is above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price we can agree on, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $1,550,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would allow us both to come to a reasonable agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
