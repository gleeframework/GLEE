"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000 for the product. I think it's a fair compromise considering its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than my desired price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",10500.0,Alice,5,
