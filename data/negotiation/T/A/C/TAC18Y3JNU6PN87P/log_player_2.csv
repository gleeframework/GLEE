# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000.

You should accept Alice's offer. While you'd prefer a lower price, $885,000 is a good deal considering the value of the product to you and the fact that you can buy from John for $1,200,000. Further negotiation might get you a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
