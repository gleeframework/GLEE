"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $10000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a good starting point,  I'm confident the product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000,  considering your initial offer. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the product's quality.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
