Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($120) allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still ensuring you don't sell for less than your guaranteed price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $119 is just a dollar less than what John is offering. This might make Bob feel like he's getting a slightly better deal, even if it's much higher than his perceived value. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If maximizing profit is the only goal, and you're completely sure John will buy it for $120, you could simply offer it to Bob for a price slightly lower than that and take the guaranteed profit."
