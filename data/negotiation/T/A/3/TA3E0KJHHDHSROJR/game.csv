"Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $1200000. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential for your business. I'm confident that you'll find this opportunity to be extremely beneficial. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1500000?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
