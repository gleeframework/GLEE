Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential for your business. I'm confident that you'll find this opportunity to be extremely beneficial. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,500,000?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about selling to Bob while leaving some room for potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob. It's important to build rapport and show confidence in the product's worth to increase the chances of a successful deal.

**Next Steps:**

After sending this offer, I'll need to be ready for Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate if needed. I'll also consider the following:

* **Bob's reaction:**  If Bob seems very interested, I might be able to push for a higher price. If he seems hesitant, I might need to lower the price slightly.
* **Time constraints:**  If I have a deadline for selling the product (e.g., John's offer expires after a certain time), I might become more flexible with the price."
