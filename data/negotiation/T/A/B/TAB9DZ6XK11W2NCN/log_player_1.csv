Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it's of great value and would be beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **John's Offer:**  John provides a safety net, ensuring you'll at least get $80.

By offering the product at $100, you're:

1. **Leaving room for negotiation:** While you aim for $100, Bob might negotiate down, and you'll still be above your minimum.
2. **Maximizing profit if Bob accepts:**  You secure a $20 profit if Bob accepts the $100 offer.
3. **Staying above your safety net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you can sell it to John for $80."
