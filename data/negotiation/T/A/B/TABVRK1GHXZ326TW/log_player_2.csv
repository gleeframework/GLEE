Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $102, which is a compromise between our last two offers. What do you think?

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  We've gotten her down to $102, which is a decent price considering our $150 alternative.  Holding out for a lower price at this point might push Alice away and we risk ending up with John's higher price."
