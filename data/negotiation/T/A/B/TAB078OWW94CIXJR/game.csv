"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While I can't go as low as $11,000, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we possibly settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is the lowest I can go on this.  I have another buyer interested at that price, but I believe you would benefit greatly from this product and I'd like to give you the opportunity to have it.",12000.0,Alice,5,
