"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way over his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for being open about your budget, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price that should be within your budget, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his ideal price point. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us, considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still within his budget with $14,000, but he should continue negotiating to see if he can push Alice down to $12,000 or $13,000. There's still room for a compromise.  He has a few rounds left, so it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I still can't go above $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on this product. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that should be more in line with the product's value to you, considering the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the negotiation is unlikely to yield a price lower than $13,000.  While this is within his budget, he's only one round away from having to make a final decision.  Since he's already rejected Alice's offer multiple times, it's unlikely she will come down further. To avoid risking getting stuck at a price he's not comfortable with, Bob should take the safe option and buy the product from John for $8,000."
