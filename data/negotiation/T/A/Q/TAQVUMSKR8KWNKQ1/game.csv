,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is $120. Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  That's a good middle ground and I think we can both be happy with that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $130. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $135. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",135.0,Alice,5,
