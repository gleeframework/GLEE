"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, I can explore if I can get a better price. It's too early to buy from John, as Alice's offer is already lower than his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While the price is tempting, I'm looking to secure the best possible deal.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My initial counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good price.  $800,000 is still a good profit for Alice, while giving me a substantial discount. It's a strong opening position for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $800,000. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my initial price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. There's room for further negotiation. Rejecting allows me to make another counteroffer and try to squeeze out a bit more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I still believe there's some room to come to an agreement that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This demonstrates my commitment to getting the deal done, while still ensuring a decent profit for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for a lower price, but I'm keeping it close enough to Alice's offer that it's still within a reasonable range.  $900,000 is a good compromise and shows I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm offering the product to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value you place on the product, while also showing my willingness to meet you halfway. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting stuck at a higher price or having Alice walk away is increasing. It's better to accept this offer, as it still provides a significant saving compared to John's price and the original asking price."
