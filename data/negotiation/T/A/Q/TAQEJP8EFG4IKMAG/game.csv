"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, something truly special. It's worth a lot to me, at least $1000000, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1500000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $1500000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This shows a good-faith effort from my end, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. However, $900000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a significant concession.  This is a final offer, and I'm ready to move on if it's not acceptable.  What's your decision?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
