"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,150,000 to you. This is a limited-time offer before I open it to other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is under your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer at a lower price. It's always worth seeing if you can negotiate a better deal before resorting to your backup option."
