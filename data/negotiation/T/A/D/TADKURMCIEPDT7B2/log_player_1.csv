{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price above my minimum value of $120, but I'm also trying to be competitive with Bob's perceived value of $100.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my target price, Bob seems unwilling to budge on his offer.  John is willing to pay my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price.  It's time to sell to John and ensure I get at least my minimum value."
