{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message is friendly and highlights the product's potential value to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, potentially leading to a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's valuation.
* **Avoid stalemate:** The offer is high enough to be appealing to Bob but leaves room for compromise.
* **Control the negotiation:**  By making the initial offer, I set the tone and have the opportunity to make counteroffers if necessary.

I'll be prepared to make counteroffers based on Bob's responses, and I'll always have the option of selling to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's also well below my initial offer of $130, indicating he's not willing to negotiate reasonably. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  This will allow me to:

* **Maintain my negotiating position:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore a middle ground:** My counteroffer will aim to find a price that's more acceptable to me while still giving Bob some wiggle room.
* **Avoid a bad deal:** Selling for $60 would be a significant loss for me, and I'm willing to risk further negotiation to achieve a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $100?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $100 is a significant compromise from my initial $130, but it's still well above Bob's $60 offer.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes fairness and value for both parties. It also reiterates the product's quality to reinforce its worth.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in entirely. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about getting a fair price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Avoid a stalemate:** My counteroffer is reasonable enough to entice Bob to accept, but still profitable for me.
* **Maintain control:** By making the counteroffer, I continue to drive the negotiation and have the option to make further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $80? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $80 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not a good deal for me.  I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiation would be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

Selling to John for $150 is the most profitable option for me at this point.  It guarantees a fair price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower offer. 

By selling to John, I can:

* **Maximize profit:** $150 is my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John ensures I don't lose any more value.
* **Save time and effort:**  Further negotiation with Bob could be lengthy and unproductive, especially given his reluctance to budge significantly.
* **Reduce risk:**  John's offer is guaranteed, eliminating the possibility of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer or making a lower counteroffer."
