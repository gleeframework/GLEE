"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $7,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This allows us to both feel fairly valued in the transaction while securing the sale.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $7,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",7250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. To move forward, how does $7,375 sound? It's a slight adjustment from my previous proposal, but still offers a good balance between our expectations.",7375.0,Alice,5,
