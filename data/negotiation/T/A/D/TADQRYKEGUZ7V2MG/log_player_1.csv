"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate and leaves a good margin for profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd rather not lose this deal completely, $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I need to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's still a substantial profit for me. I believe this offer is more reasonable for Bob while still being a fair deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping I can close the deal without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,100,000. This is a further concession, but I'm still confident in the value of my product and believe Bob will see this as a fair price. I'm hoping to close the deal before I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are now in round 6, and Bob is still offering significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made significant concessions, and I don't want to risk going lower and having him reject my offer again.  Selling to John at this point guarantees me a fair price for the product, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future."
