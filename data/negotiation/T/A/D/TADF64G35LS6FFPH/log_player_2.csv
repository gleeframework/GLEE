Round 2

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

We're getting closer, but $100 is still above our target price. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
