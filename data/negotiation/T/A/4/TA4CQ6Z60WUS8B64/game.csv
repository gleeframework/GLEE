"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm a bit of a savvy shopper, and I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $85? That's the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
