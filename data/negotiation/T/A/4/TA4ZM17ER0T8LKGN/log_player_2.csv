# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above my budget of $100. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to go down to $120? "", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $160 is still above my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price.  I'm still considering buying from John, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about $140?  That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm sticking to my goal of getting the product for under $100, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise.  $140 is a good middle ground between our previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I think $140 is still a bit low. I'm willing to compromise at $155, which is closer to my minimum price and still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $155 is still above my budget, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $100 to ensure I get the product within my budget.  While I could continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll come down further, and I risk running out of time."
