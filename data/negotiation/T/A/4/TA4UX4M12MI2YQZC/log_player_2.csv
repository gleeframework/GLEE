"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $180 is far higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120. Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $120, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $160 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  While it's closer than her initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $140.  I'm confident you'll find that a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $140 to make this deal worth it for me. How about we say $155? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for a great product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk is that Alice will keep counter-offering, and Bob might end up with a price higher than his budget.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and buy from John, ensuring he gets the product at his target price of $120."
