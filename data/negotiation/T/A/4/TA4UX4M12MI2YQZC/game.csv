"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 right now.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $120, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it at this price. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $140.  I'm confident you'll find that a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $140 to make this deal worth it for me. How about we say $155? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",155.0,Alice,5,
