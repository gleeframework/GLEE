"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $900,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm confident that Bob, being willing to pay $800,000, will at least consider this offer.  We'll see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's willingness to pay $850,000.  Let's see if this gets us closer to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $860,000 is very close to my target. While I'd love to get closer to $900,000, we're already on round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal by being too stubborn. Accepting this offer will ensure I get a good price and we can finalize the transaction."
