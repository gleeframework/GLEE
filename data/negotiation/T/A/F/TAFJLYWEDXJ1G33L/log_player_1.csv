"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum value of $1,500,000, but it's also significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures you don't immediately give away too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable value.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal. You still have 9 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  This price still gives you a significant advantage over your initial assessment, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you're aiming for. It's worth pushing for a bit more, especially since you have several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value it brings to your business. Let's reach a deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at a comfortable price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,025,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,025,000 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable value, you still have 4 rounds left. There's potential to push for a bit more. You can see Bob is getting closer to your desired price point, and you can try to leverage this for a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,040,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to reach a more agreeable price point. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1040000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,040,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,020,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your desired price point, you have 2 rounds left and you can still push for a slightly higher price. There's room for a small counteroffer to potentially reach a more favorable price point.  You want to avoid selling to John unless you absolutely have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,020,000 is still a bit short of my target.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,030,000. We've come a long way, and this final compromise will ensure a successful deal for both of us.  Let's close this out and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1030000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,030,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,015,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and you're running out of time.  While $1,015,000 is closer to your minimum than any previous offer from Bob, it's still below your target.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees you the highest profit and secures a better deal than you could potentially get from Bob at this point."
