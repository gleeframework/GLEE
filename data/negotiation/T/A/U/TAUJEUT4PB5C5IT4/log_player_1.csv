"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  This will show that I'm serious about getting a fair price while still being open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial value.  Would you be willing to pay $11,000? I think that's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,600 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I'd ideally like more, it's significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer will secure a good profit and allow me to move on."
