"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to own this product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $11500 is better than your first offer, it's still a bit too high for me right now. I'm really aiming to stay around $10500. Would you be willing to consider that? It's a fair price that allows us both to come away feeling good about the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit over my budget.  I'm going to make one last offer of $10750.  I'm really trying to stay within my price range, and I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,
