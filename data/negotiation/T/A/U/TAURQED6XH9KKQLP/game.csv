"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This reflects a significant discount from the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000. This price still offers you a substantial benefit and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,080,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
