"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $100 is a good price, but you can likely do better.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and you can always go to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
``` 

You're starting with a lower counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to meet you in the middle.  $80 is still a good price for you, and it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has come down to $90, which is a fair price and within your budget. It's better than your counteroffer and  you're getting a good deal. Accepting this offer saves you time and potential hassle."
