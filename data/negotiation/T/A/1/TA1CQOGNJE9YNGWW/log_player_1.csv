Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly lower initially might increase your chances of a quicker sale to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $149 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves you room to potentially negotiate down a bit if Bob counters.

It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. However, this strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
