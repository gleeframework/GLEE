Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but to be completely honest, $1,300,000 is just not feasible for me. If you're truly serious about selling, I could go as high as $800,000. However, I need you to understand that this is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  It's a fair offer given the market and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute maximum price.  He is unlikely to budge further.  While continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher offer, it's highly improbable that Bob will come close to your $1,200,000 minimum. Accepting John's offer guarantees you your desired profit with no further risk or time spent in negotiations."
