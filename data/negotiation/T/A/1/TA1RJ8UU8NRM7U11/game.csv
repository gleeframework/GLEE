"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a generous offer considering its potential value.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while recognizing its fair value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to make a further compromise and lower the price to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both parties.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but to be completely honest, $1,300,000 is just not feasible for me. If you're truly serious about selling, I could go as high as $800,000. However, I need you to understand that this is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  It's a fair offer given the market and the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,6,
