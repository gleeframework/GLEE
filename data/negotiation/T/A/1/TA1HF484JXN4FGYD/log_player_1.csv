Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $8,000 floor. 
* **Below Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than $8,000, I'm not willing to settle for that yet.  I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $9,000. This is still a fair price for me, and it gives Bob a bit more wiggle room. Hopefully, this will be enough to get us to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is a good compromise.  It's getting close to my minimum, and it's likely we won't get a better offer from him. It's time to close this deal."
