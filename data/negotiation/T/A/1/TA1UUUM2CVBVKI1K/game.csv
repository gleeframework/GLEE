"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in this product, though. Would you be willing to come down to $850,000? This price would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $925,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm feeling more comfortable with $875,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Would you be open to considering this offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to make this work. I'm really determined to get this product, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $880,000? This would be a great compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $885,000.
