"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 18000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of 14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 11000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet in the middle at 13000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11000. It's fair to both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",11000.0,Bob,6,
