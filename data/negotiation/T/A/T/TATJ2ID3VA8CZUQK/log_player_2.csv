"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's offer:**  $140.
* **John's offer:**  $150.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still get the product for less. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal elsewhere."
