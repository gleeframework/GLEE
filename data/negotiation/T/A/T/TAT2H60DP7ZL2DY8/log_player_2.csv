Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,250,000? This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,120,000 is still not enough for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $1,180,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a deal you can't refuse.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $1,200,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price for the product. If you can't meet that, I'll have to move on to another buyer.

It's clear Alice won't go below her own valuation of $1,200,000. Since you can buy it from John at that price, there's no point in continuing the negotiation."
