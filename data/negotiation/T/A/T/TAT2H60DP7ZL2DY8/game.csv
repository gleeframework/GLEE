"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,250,000? This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. I can tell this is valuable to you. While $1,250,000 is closer, I need to be a bit more conservative with my budget. How about $1,120,000? That's a fair offer.",1120000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,120,000 is still not enough for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $1,180,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a deal you can't refuse.",1180000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle. That said, to make this work for me, it needs to be a bit lower. How about  $1,150,000?  That's the best I can do.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $1,200,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price for the product. If you can't meet that, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
