Round 2

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. I can tell this is valuable to you. While $1,250,000 is closer, I need to be a bit more conservative with my budget. How about $1,120,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
