I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $130 is still below my minimum of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to that price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}

Bob is insistent on $130, which is below my minimum.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm going to sell to John for $150."
