{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $820000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $790000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?
