Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept $150, it opens the door for counter-offers.  
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net, ensuring Alice doesn't have to go below her minimum.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay.  If Alice had more information about Bob, she might adjust her strategy accordingly."
