"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, considering its potential value to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal as well.  How about $1,150,000?  This price reflects the value you've identified in the product and still allows me to gain a reasonable return on my investment. Let's find common ground here.
