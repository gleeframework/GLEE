"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives you a significant saving while still allowing me to get a fair return on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this happen.",887500.0,Alice,5,
