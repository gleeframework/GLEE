Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts high, but it gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation. It also leaves room for you to potentially negotiate downwards if Bob counters with a lower price. 

Remember, this is just the first move.  You need to consider Bob's response and strategize your next steps based on his counteroffers (if any) and your goal to maximize your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to squeeze a little more out of him.  There's always the chance he's willing to go a bit higher.  The risk is that he might walk away and you'll be stuck with the lower price.

Let's try a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise: it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial price. It shows you're willing to negotiate, but you still value the product above his initial offer. This should encourage him to come up a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just $1,000 less than your initial counteroffer. It's a good compromise, especially considering that you can always sell to John for $15,000.  It's worth securing a higher price now rather than risking a lower price or further negotiation."
