"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high.  I'm firm at $85.  If you're not willing to come down to that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm at $85, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still only willing to pay $85.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell it for $85. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $95. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to offer $90, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $92. It's the last chance I'm giving you to make a deal.",92.0,Alice,9,
