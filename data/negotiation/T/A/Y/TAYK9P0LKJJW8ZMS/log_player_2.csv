"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $120 is still too high for Bob's budget.  He can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can likely get a better price with more negotiation.  He's already made it clear he's willing to pay $85, so there's no reason to accept $110 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high.  I'm firm at $85.  If you're not willing to come down to that, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm at $85, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject the offer.  He's shown he's willing to walk away, and Alice is clearly unwilling to go lower than $100.  This means Bob has some leverage to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still only willing to pay $85.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell it for $85. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $95. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, he still has some room to negotiate.  Alice has shown that she's willing to come down in price, and he's shown he's willing to walk away.  He can push for a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to offer $90, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $92. It's the last chance I'm giving you to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He has made it clear he wants to pay no more than $90, and Alice is still holding out for $92.  It's likely that Alice won't budge further, and Bob is running out of time.  John's offer is the best deal available, and Bob should take it."
