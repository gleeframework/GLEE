Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Dear Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $1,000,000 (Bob's value) leaves potential profit on the table. 
* **Below Your Guaranteed Sale:** Offering it too close to $1,500,000 (your guaranteed sale price) minimizes Bob's incentive to buy.
* **The Compromise:** $1,350,000 offers a substantial profit margin for you while still being a significantly better deal for Bob than losing the opportunity.

**The Message:**

The message aims to be polite, professional, and suggestive of a negotiation while subtly anchoring the price at a higher point."
