Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you a chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Initial Price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation or a potentially very profitable sale.
* **Emphasizing Value and Scarcity:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob and creating a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) can encourage him to accept a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it doesn't completely price Bob out. If he negotiates, you can lower the price slightly and still make a significant profit.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start with a slightly lower price.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  The higher you go, the higher the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and you ""leaving money on the table"" by selling to John."
