"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
