"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll use the initial rounds to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but not by much. I'm still aiming for a decent profit, but I'm also trying to find a compromise point with Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round, as the price will likely continue to decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob.  If he doesn't increase his offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round to guarantee a profit that meets my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to continue to lower my price, but only slightly. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure.  If he rejects this offer, I might need to sell to John in the next round to avoid potentially ending up with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to counter with a price in between our current offers.  If he rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round.  The clock is ticking."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm not willing to go lower than this.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John in the next round to ensure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I would love to get more, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer in the next round.  I'll accept Bob's offer and avoid the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
