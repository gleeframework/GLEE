Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's of great value and you'll be very satisfied with it."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a small discount while allowing you to maximize your profit.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100, so there's no risk of being left with the product."
