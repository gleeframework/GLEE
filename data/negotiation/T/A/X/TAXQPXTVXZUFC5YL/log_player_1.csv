"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway, or if I need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. How about $9,250? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm proposing a price that's still below my minimum, but closer to what I believe I can get. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer, and it shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,000? I'm trying to be reasonable here, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 as a final compromise. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and I'll ensure you're happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still above my minimum. I'm trying to send a signal that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go too much lower.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really trying to find a middle ground here, but $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but no higher. I hope you can understand my position and meet me halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm aware that I'm running out of time. I need to be careful not to let the negotiations drag on too long, as I might end up losing out on a better deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,200 is still a bit low. I'm willing to go down to $9,350, as a final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it also shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

I'm making a small concession, but I'm still above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, or if he's going to continue to push for a lower price. I'm also trying to reiterate that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not going to go much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,350 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can understand my position and meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm still not thrilled with the price, $9,250 is only $250 below my minimum.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob altogether. I also need to consider that I have only two rounds left before I have to make a decision about selling to John. It's a risk, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
