"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $13,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go up to $11,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer $12,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.
