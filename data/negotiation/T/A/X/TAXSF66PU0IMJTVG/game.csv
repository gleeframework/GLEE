"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $140 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",130.0,Bob,4,
