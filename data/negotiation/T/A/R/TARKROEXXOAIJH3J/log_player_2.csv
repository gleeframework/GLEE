"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $130 is better than buying from John for $150.
* Even though you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John, it's not guaranteed that you would be able to get a lower price from John. 
* Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you the product at a price that is within your budget and saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
