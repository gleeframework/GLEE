Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value to me, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a good deal. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but higher than what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Optimism:**  I'm trying to leave room for negotiation, but I want to start with a price that gives me a decent profit. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal!
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I might lower my price slightly, but I won't go below $15,000 as that's my minimum acceptable price.  
* If negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, guaranteeing me my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $11500 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm open to negotiating, $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, and I want to see if I can find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

I will now send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $15,000 but still somewhat lower than my initial offer. I will try to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price still gives me a decent return, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, focusing on the fact that it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. 
* **Maintain Confidence:** While I'm being flexible, I'm not giving in completely. I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Hope for Acceptance:**  Ideally, Bob will accept my counteroffer, and we can finalize the deal.
* **Prepare for More Negotiations:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to carefully assess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept his offer (if it's closer to my minimum).  
* **The John Option:**  As always, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** While Bob's offer is a bit closer to my minimum price of $15,000, it's still $4,000 lower.
* **Time is Money:**  We've been negotiating for a while, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a quick and hassle-free sale.

**Reasoning:**

It's important to weigh the potential benefits of continuing to negotiate against the guaranteed profit from selling to John.  While there's always a chance I might get a slightly better price from Bob, the risk of further negotiations dragging on is too high. I'm comfortable with the $15,000 offer and want to secure the deal."
