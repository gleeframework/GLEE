"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than what he'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation. He should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $750,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still a bit far apart. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $825,000 is better than John's offer, he can likely get a lower price.  He should reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not quite ready to accept $800,000 yet. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $815,000. This is the lowest price we're willing to accept, and we believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close to Bob's target.** At $815,000, Bob is getting a good deal, saving $385,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.** If Bob rejects and makes a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept. He risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **It's a fair compromise.** While Bob could push for a slightly lower price,  $815,000 is a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
