Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to secure a good deal. I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning the product's value and appealing to Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $85 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $80?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
