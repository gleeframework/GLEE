"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  $80 is quite low, I was hoping for something closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $90? I'm trying to keep my spending under $100.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is still quite a ways off from what I'm looking for. I could come down to $120, but that's my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
