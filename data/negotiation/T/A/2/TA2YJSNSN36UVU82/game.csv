,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Would you consider $9,500? That feels like a fair offer to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This price reflects the value of the product while hopefully still fitting within your budget.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  $11,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $10,500? That's my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,
