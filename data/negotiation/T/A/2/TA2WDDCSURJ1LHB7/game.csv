"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $130 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go down to $145, which is my absolute lowest price.  If you're not able to go higher than that, I'll have to accept another offer.  Let me know what you think.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",135.0,Bob,6,
