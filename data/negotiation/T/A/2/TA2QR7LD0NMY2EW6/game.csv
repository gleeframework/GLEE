"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and it's a price that would be highly beneficial for both of us.  I believe this product has the potential to greatly benefit your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Please consider this offer carefully.
