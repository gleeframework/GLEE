"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $2000000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it will be worth every penny for you. Let's discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $1200000 is simply too low for this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, but it still allows for a substantial return for you. Let's work together to make this happen.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1400000 is still too low for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1550000, but this is my final offer.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1450000, but I really think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider this price?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1450000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Considering its unique capabilities and potential, I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $1500000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and it's the price John is willing to pay.  Let's make this deal happen, or I'll have to move forward with John.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
