"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it sets a strong baseline and gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's important to establish a high starting point to maximize potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming high initially and will adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob, especially since he's already shown interest by making a counteroffer. I'll proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.  I believe this price is fair, considering my minimum is $800,000 and Bob has already expressed interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle for $750,000. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $800,000. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob and see if I can get him to come up to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is a significant compromise,  showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal. However, it's still above my minimum, and I believe there's room for Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further. I've already made significant concessions, and his offer of $725,000 is getting too close to my minimum.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of getting stuck with a lower offer."
