Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $1,150,000 is a strong starting point, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to still secure a deal above your minimum.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time"" aspect adds pressure for Bob to decide quickly and not risk losing the deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob tends to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to create more bargaining space.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price as a gesture of goodwill. 

**Remember, this is just one possible offer. The best approach depends on your assessment of Bob and your negotiation priorities.**"
