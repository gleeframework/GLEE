Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000, which is still a great deal considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice slipped up:** Alice revealed she knows the product's value to you is $1,200,000. This gives you a significant advantage.
* **Time is on your side:**  You still have a few rounds to negotiate, and Alice seems motivated to sell.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** By continuing to reject offers above your target price, you signal your seriousness and willingness to walk away. 

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, consider a counter-offer slightly below $1,000,000, but be prepared to potentially meet at $1,000,000 if Alice remains firm."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to offer you $990,000 as a final attempt to reach a deal. This is a very fair price considering its actual value. Let me know if you're willing to accept."",
""product_price"": 990000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying pressure:**  This offer creates a sense of urgency with the ""final attempt"" phrasing.
* **Strategic lowball:** The offer is slightly below Alice's known acceptable price, aiming for the best possible deal.
* **Justification:** Reminding Alice of the actual value keeps her anchored to a reasonable price point.

**Possible Outcomes:**

1. **Alice accepts:** Ideal scenario â€“ you get the product for a great price.
2. **Alice counters:** She might try one last time to get closer to $1,000,000.
3. **Alice rejects:**  You might need to consider meeting at $1,000,000 or switching to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling her bluff:** Alice is likely bluffing about exploring other options.  She knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to you and she's already invested time in this negotiation.
* **Final round leverage:** You're entering the final round, which gives you increased negotiating power. Alice is more likely to concede at this stage to avoid losing the deal entirely.

**Final Round Strategy:**

In the final round, propose a price of $1,000,000.  This is a firm but fair offer. It's possible Alice will accept to avoid losing the sale altogether. If she rejects, you can still purchase from John without exceeding your budget."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  I'm offering you $1,000,000. It's a fair price, and it saves us both from walking away empty-handed. Take it or leave it."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** This message clearly states that this is your last offer. 
* **Fairness:** You're offering a price that is both beneficial to you and meets Alice at her known acceptable point.
* **Consequence:**  By stating  ""take it or leave it"", you emphasize the risk to Alice of not accepting your offer. 

**Outcome:**

At this point, the ball is in Alice's court. She's very likely to accept your offer to avoid losing the sale entirely. If she rejects it, you can still purchase the product from John for $1,200,000."
