Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering the product for $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.** I value the product at no less than $15,000, and Bob's offer is only $10,000.  
* **Selling to John is a better option.**  I can immediately secure a sale with John for $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.** While I could counteroffer Bob, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly, given his initial offer was already below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  Given the product's value, I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  
* **Compromise:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Value proposition:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, highlighting that it's still a good deal.
* **Flexibility:** This counteroffer gives me room to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unchanged.**  He's sticking to his $10,000 offer, which is still below my minimum.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to be successful.**  There's little room for negotiation, and further rounds are unlikely to yield a significantly higher price from Bob.
* **Selling to John is the best option.**  I can immediately sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring a profit and avoiding further negotiation with Bob."
