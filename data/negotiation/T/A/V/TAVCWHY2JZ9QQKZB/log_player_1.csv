"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is considerably higher.  Would you consider $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

We've come down a bit to show some flexibility, but we're still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I still believe $1,600,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Can you consider $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,700,000 is getting closer, we're still leaving a significant sum on the table compared to our desired outcome. We'll try to push a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,950,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
``` 

We're getting closer to the later stages of negotiation, so a slightly larger concession might encourage Bob while still aiming for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,800,000 is still a bit too high. Can you consider $1,825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is now getting very close to our minimum acceptable price, and with fewer rounds remaining, the risk of him walking away increases. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit compared to John's offer, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk losing him altogether."
