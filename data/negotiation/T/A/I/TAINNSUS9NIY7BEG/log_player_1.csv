"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer to gauge his interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet.  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price considering he rejected my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is too low.  While I'm getting nervous about running out of rounds, I'm going to reject this offer. I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm also trying to gauge his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might not get a better deal, and I'll be stuck with a lower price or even no deal at all.  To avoid this risk, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and a secure income."
