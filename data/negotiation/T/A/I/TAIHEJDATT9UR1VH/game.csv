"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for such a great product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $130? That's still a good price for this amazing product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $130, which would be $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",125.0,Bob,6,
