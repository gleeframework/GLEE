"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth more than that. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've done your research, Bob, but I have to consider the value that I've put into this product. I can see that you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $10000. It's a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I'm willing to go up to $10000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $9500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9000, so I'm thinking $9250. Can you meet me at that price?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer at $9750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",9750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm starting to feel like I'm leaving money on the table. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll counteroffer at $10200. This is my absolute final offer, and I expect you to make a decision from here.",10200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $10200. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $9000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",9000.0,Bob,10,
