Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000.

Bob should continue to negotiate. He's already at $10,500.  Alice's offer is only $500 closer to what he's willing to pay. He should try to get closer to his target price by making a counteroffer."

```

Bob has been trying to negotiate, but Alice is only willing to come down by $300 in her last offer. At this point, Bob has only one round left to negotiate before he has to make a decision. Since the deal isn't getting any closer to what Bob is willing to pay, the best option is to buy from John for $10,000."
