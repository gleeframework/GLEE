Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $10,500 for this. It's a fair price considering the value it offers you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's the best I'm going to get without risking losing him completely and having to settle with John."
