"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and you're better off trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you given the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and there's still room for further negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before settling or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900,000. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price won't drop further, or the negotiation will drag on. 

It's more efficient to secure the product from John for $800,000, ensuring you get the best possible deal within your budget."
