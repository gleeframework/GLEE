Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  This gives me the best chance of getting my desired price and also allows me to quickly move on to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further, hoping to get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is a small concession from my initial price, but it shows flexibility and could potentially entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,400 is too low for me. It's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm concerned that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth without a guarantee of a better offer.  I'm confident that John will purchase the product at my desired price, so I'll take his offer and avoid further potential losses."
