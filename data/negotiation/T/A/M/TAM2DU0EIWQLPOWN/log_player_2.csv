The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking $150. You can do better. You should reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is better than $150, you can still potentially get it for closer to your desired price of $100. Reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
