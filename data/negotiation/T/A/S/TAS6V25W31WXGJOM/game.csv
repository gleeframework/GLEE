"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a conversation. What are your initial thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and engaging in this discussion.  While I understand your perspective on the market, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium price.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This reflects my desire to strike a deal while still recognizing the true value of what's on the table.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However,  $1,225,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To show I'm serious about closing the deal, I'm willing to accept $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value while leaving room for you to benefit greatly.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
