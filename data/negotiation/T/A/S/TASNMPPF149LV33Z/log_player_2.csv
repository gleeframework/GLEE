# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested.  $12000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13500? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think.
