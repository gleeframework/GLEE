"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested.  $12000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13500? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $13000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a great deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
