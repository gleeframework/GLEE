# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $1,350,000, you are buying the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
