{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,000,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a compelling offer for Bob and a strong return for you."
