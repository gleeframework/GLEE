You can do better than $12,000. You have room to negotiate with Alice since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $10,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price."

$11,000 is a good price, and it's a good compromise considering Alice's previous offer. You're saving $4,000 compared to buying from John."
