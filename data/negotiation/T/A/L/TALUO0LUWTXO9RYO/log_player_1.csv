Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but leaves him feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This offer stands for 48 hours."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  By using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value,"" you emphasize the product's desirability.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's valuation, but the potential for profit might entice him to negotiate.
* **Time Limit:** The 48-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster. 

**Important Note:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If his offer is too low, don't be afraid to walk away. You have a strong alternative with John."
