Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. While I would ideally like to accommodate all parties involved, I am unable to accept $65 as my offer was based on the product's worth and my desire to recover some of my investment. I am willing to negotiate further, so let me propose an alternative. How about we aim for a middle ground at $75? This still allows us to cover some costs while being more reasonable than my initial offer. Please let me know if this suggestion works for you.
