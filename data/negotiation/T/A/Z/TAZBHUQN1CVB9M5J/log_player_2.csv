"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $12000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and its potential impact on your business. Considering my goal is to maximize the return on this investment, I suggest we aim for a price slightly above your valuation but still within reason. Would you be open to discussing a price around $13500? This allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
