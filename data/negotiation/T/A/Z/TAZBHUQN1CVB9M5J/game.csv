"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $12000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and its potential impact on your business. Considering my goal is to maximize the return on this investment, I suggest we aim for a price slightly above your valuation but still within reason. Would you be open to discussing a price around $13500? This allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",13500.0,Alice,1,
