"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $12,500? This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $11,500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
