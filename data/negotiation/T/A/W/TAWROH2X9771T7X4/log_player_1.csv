Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $10,000.  If he rejects, I can then counter-offer or sell to John for $8,000 as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still within my acceptable range. It's a better deal than selling to John, and it's likely that Bob wouldn't offer any higher in subsequent rounds. Accepting his offer is the most rational choice."
