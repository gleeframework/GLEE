"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is still too expensive. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:** Alice's offer of $980,000 is very close to Bob's budget limit of $800,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could reject the offer and try for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice would come down further. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If Bob rejects the offer and tries to negotiate more, Alice might walk away and Bob would have to buy from John at $800,000. 

In this situation, it's a calculated risk. Bob is likely to save the most money by accepting the offer, even though it's a bit higher than his initial target."
