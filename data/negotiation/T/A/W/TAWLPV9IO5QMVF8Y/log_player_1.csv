Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while ensuring I get more than my fallback offer from John ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it just below my guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting a bit higher leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still guaranteeing a sale."
