"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you at a price that's closer to what you're comfortable with. However, I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,020,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground. I'm willing to make one last offer at $1,000,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your last offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000. I think you know the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to make one last offer to you, and I'll meet you at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
