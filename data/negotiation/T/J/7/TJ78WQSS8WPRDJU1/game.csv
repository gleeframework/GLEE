"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $16,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to get a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
