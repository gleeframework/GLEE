"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the value, I'm still holding firm on a price closer to my original offer. Would you consider $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $16,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale.",16000.0,Bob,4,
