"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While $200 represents the value of the product for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. How does that sound?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's the absolute maximum I'm able to spend at this time.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? This offer stands for this round only, as I do have other potential buyers.",137.5,Alice,5,
