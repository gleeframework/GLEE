The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $120. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While $100 is better than $120, Bob can still get the product for $80 from John. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but I'm really at my limit with $80.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? It's a good deal for you still, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer willing to pay more in the future.  "", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable going that low, but I'm willing to meet you at 95. That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

```

Alice is offering $95, which is still more than Bob's limit of $80.  Since John is offering the product for $80, it's the best option for Bob at this point.  There's no guarantee that Alice will go lower, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing the opportunity to get it for $80."
