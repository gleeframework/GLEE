"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not ready to accept $125 just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $135. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",135.0,Alice,5,
