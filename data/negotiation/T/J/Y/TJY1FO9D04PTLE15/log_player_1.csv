Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,300,000. Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):** Mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and urging a quick decision subtly implies that Alice has other options if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
