"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $6,000 is quite low, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this. While $7,500 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle at $8,500?  That's a bit closer to your price while still staying within a reasonable range for me.",8500.0,Bob,6,
