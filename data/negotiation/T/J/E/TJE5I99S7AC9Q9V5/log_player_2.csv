Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for this product.  Let's keep talking and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a little below where I need to be. I'm prepared to drop my price to $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is exactly your maximum price, and it's the same price John is selling it for.  There's no reason to continue negotiating as you can't get a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product without risking losing it to John."
