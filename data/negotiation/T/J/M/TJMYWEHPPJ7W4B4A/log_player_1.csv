Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering it at $120, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle on a price above your $100 minimum.
* **Awareness of John:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $100, so any offer Bob makes below that isn't worth considering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is too low. You know you can get $100 from John. It's worth seeing if Bob will go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I could come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming High but Reasonable:** While we know John will pay $100, aiming for a price higher than Bob's valuation ($80) but lower than our initial offer keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting $105 positions it as a compromise and might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** We're still above our guaranteed sale price, giving us leverage. If Bob rejects this, we can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is a good deal. It's higher than what John is offering ($100), and it's unlikely Bob will go any higher. Accepting this offer maximizes your profit."
