Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $12,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), making it potentially attractive to him. 
* **It's a clear and direct offer:**  The message is concise and focuses on the value proposition for Bob.

By starting with this offer, you leave room to negotiate and potentially earn closer to the $15,000 value, while still being confident you can get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than John's offer of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $12,000 and less than what you believe the product is worth.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

You will send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** By dropping to $10,500, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a substantial profit margin.
* **Staying above John's offer:** This offer remains above John's $8,000, ensuring you're not losing out on a potential better deal.
* **Positive messaging:** The message reaffirms Bob's potential value and emphasizes the deal's attractiveness to him. 

This counteroffer positions you for a successful negotiation by showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is not ideal, it is a significant improvement over John's offer of $8,000.  This is a good compromise that gets you closer to your desired price, and it's likely Bob won't budge much further.  

**Next Steps:**

You will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $9,500."
