"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value. While I cannot disclose its exact nature, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm confident it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right person, and I believe you might be that person. I'm willing to part with it for $950000. This price reflects the value I place on it, but also acknowledges the potential for its worth to be even greater in your hands. Please consider this offer carefully, as I'm sure you'll agree it's a fantastic opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice claims the product is worth at least $800,000 to her, but is willing to sell it for $950,000. This suggests she might be willing to accept a lower price, especially if she believes it holds more value for you. By rejecting her offer, you can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice, or at the very least, explore other options before settling for John's $1,000,000 price."
