Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have John as a guaranteed buyer, aiming for the highest possible price with Bob first maximizes your potential profit.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price of $10,000 establishes a firm stance. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, you have room to negotiate down slightly while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay. If you had more information about Bob, you could potentially tailor your offer for a higher chance of acceptance."
