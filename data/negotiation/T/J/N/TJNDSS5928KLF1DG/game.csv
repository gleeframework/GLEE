"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you.  However, $60 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $92.50? That's my final offer.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However,  $92.50 is just a bit outside my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80, which I believe is a fair offer. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,6,
