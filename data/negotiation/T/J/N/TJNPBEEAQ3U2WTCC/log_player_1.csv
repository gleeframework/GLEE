"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good profit. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is too low. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $11,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin. I believe this price is fair and will entice Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a difficult decision. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,500 is still a decent profit.  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of him walking away or me having to settle for John's offer is too high. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
