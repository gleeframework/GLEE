"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm interested in the product and would like to offer $1,250,000.  This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair value for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still above my limit. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,300,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a small compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. This is getting close to my minimum value, and we both know the product is worth even more than that.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
