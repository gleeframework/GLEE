# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm interested in the product and would like to offer $1,250,000.  This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still above my limit. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,300,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a small compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. This is getting close to my minimum value, and we both know the product is worth even more than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my limit.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing.  To secure the product and avoid further negotiations, I'll go with John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000."
