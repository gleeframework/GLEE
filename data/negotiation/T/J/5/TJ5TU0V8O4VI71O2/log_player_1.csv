"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum value, but high enough to potentially spark interest in Bob.  It also leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm interested in the product and would like to offer $1,250,000.  This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to sell to him, I have 10 rounds to close a deal.  I want to see if I can push for a better price,  especially since I have the option to sell to John for a higher amount if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value. However, I want to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing a good faith effort to meet in the middle.  It also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still above my limit. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,300,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I still have the option to sell to John for a higher amount. It's only round 4, and I want to see if I can push Bob to go even higher. The goal is to maximize profit, and I'm not willing to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a small compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. This is getting close to my minimum value, and we both know the product is worth even more than that."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because it's still below my minimum value. However, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and move closer to his offer. This counteroffer is only $25,000 more than his last one, demonstrating that I'm serious about striking a deal.  I'm also reminding him of the product's true value, hoping to subtly pressure him to consider a higher price."
