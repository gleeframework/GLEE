"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $220, which I believe reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 220}
```
This is a starting point for negotiation. It's important to start high to give yourself room to negotiate down while staying above your minimum selling price. 
* **The message** aims to be positive and friendly while emphasizing the product's value. 
* **The price** is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's valuation. This allows you to potentially get a price closer to your ideal while having the flexibility to lower it during negotiations. 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your effort in finding something suitable for me. After considering the value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $160 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Let's analyze the situation:

* **Bob's Offer:** $160
* **Your Minimum:** $150
* **John's Offer:** $150

Bob's offer is higher than both your minimum and John's offer. While you could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer in subsequent rounds. 

**Decision:** {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John at your minimum price."
