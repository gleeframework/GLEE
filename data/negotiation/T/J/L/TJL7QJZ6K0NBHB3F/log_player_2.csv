"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. While the product is worth more to you than John's offer, there's room for negotiation to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly below my maximum budget and John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $850,000 is still above both my budget and John's offer.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?"",
""product_price"": 775000
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offers. It keeps the negotiation moving while staying below my maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $775,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $812,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now marginal. Buying from John at $800,000 saves me money and avoids further negotiation."
