"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it would help me cover my costs.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, and I'm getting closer to a deal we both can agree on.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us to both move forward.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,200. Can you meet me there?",13200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I really appreciate you coming up to $13,200. To make this work for me, I'd need to be at $13,400.  This is a small difference and I think it gets us both to a fair agreement. What do you say?",13400.0,Alice,7,
