"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we start our negotiation at $125. This price reflects not only the product's worth but also our commitment to providing exceptional value to our customers. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's highly unlikely she'll immediately drop to a price you'd find acceptable.  You're better off seeing if she'll come down in a counter-offer."
