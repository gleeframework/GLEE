Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting high, I anticipate Bob will likely counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Backup Plan (John):** I know I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below both my starting price and my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested, but trying to get a bargain. There's still a gap to bridge through further negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer because I have a guaranteed sale to John at a price that meets my needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $90, I'm willing to come down to $130. I believe this product offers great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've reduced my price by $30, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still well above my minimum of $120.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a brief reason for the price to keep the perceived value high. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to assess how serious Bob is about buying the product and how much he's willing to spend."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Price:** Bob's offer of $110 is above my absolute minimum of $120. While not ideal, it's a reasonable profit.
* **Avoid Further Haggling:** Accepting now avoids potential for further back-and-forth negotiations that might not result in a significantly better outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now means I get paid quicker and can move on to other potential sales."
