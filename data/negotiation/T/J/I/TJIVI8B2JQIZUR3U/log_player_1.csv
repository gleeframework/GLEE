"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his value range and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can bridge the gap. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can push for a better deal. I'm not yet at the point where selling to John is the most attractive option.  I have several rounds remaining to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,850,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, acknowledging Bob's persistence and potentially signaling my willingness to close the deal. However, it's still above my minimum threshold. This is a calculated risk, but I believe I can still secure a good price while maintaining a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, we're still quite far apart.  With 4 rounds remaining, I still have time to push for a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell at this point, and believe I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1775000}
```

I'm offering $1,775,000. This is a slight concession, but still above Bob's last offer. We're getting closer to a potential agreement. With only 3 rounds remaining, the pressure is on for both of us to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  We're very close to my minimum, but I still have two rounds left.  There's a good chance I can push for a higher price, and selling to John for a lower price would mean losing out on a potential profit.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing my willingness to close the deal. It's also just above my minimum threshold, but it's a risk I'm willing to take with only two rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call. While I wanted to get closer to $1,700,000, it's the last round and I risk losing out completely if I reject Bob's offer. Accepting the offer of $1,650,000 ensures a sale and a decent profit, considering my minimum requirement of $1,500,000."
