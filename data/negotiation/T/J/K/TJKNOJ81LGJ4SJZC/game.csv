"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at a minimum of $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations with a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects its immense value and potential for your business. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find common ground and make this happen.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,000,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
