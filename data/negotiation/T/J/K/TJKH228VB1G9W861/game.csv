"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 seems a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1520000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value I've seen so far. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
