"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $12,000 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would give you a great deal and still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate at $12,500? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,250, which is a significant discount from my initial asking price. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the reduction, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $12,750? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",12750.0,Bob,6,
