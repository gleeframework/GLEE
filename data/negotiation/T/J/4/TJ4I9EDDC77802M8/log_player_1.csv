``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also important to be friendly and build rapport with Bob to encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $12,000 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would give you a great deal and still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate at $12,500? This would be a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,250, which is a significant discount from my initial asking price. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being firm about my minimum price and making a concession to keep the negotiation moving.  I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product and the potential benefits of this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the reduction, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $12,750? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to meet my needs.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's a better option for me."
