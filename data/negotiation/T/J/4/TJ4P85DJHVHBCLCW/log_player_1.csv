Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob a good starting point and allows for some negotiation. I believe the product is worth more than this, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also mindful of the fact that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while still getting a decent price for the product."

Bob's offer is the same as his last offer.  It's a bit lower than I hoped for, but I'm going to accept it.  I'm aware I could continue to negotiate and possibly get a higher offer, but  I want to avoid the risk of losing the sale completely.  I'm also considering the time and effort involved in further negotiations.   $12,000 is a decent profit and it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
