Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. It's a great deal for something worth $100 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $100.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for a product worth $100 to you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of it.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price point of $100.  I'm happy to accept and close the deal.  There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer or having to sell to John."
