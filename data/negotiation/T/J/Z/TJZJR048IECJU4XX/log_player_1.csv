Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but also hopefully reflects the product's true value.  If he rejects this offer, we can start bargaining. I'm prepared to go lower, but I won't go below $1,000,000, as that's my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counter and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,200,000. This is still significantly more than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he sees this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely and ending up with only $1,000,000 from John.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my bottom line."
