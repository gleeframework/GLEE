"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $60, but $90 is still a bit much for me. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $75 is still too low. How about we settle at $85? That's a good compromise and closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down.  How about we agree on $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
