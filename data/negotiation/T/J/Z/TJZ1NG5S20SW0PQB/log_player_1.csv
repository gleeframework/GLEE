"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer right away. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to adjust the price if necessary.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to get at least $100 for the product, otherwise, it's more beneficial for me to sell it to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $60, but $90 is still a bit much for me. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target of $100. I'm not desperate, so I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $75 is still too low. How about we settle at $85? That's a good compromise and closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down.  How about we agree on $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $100.  I'm not willing to go lower, and with only 4 rounds left, it's likely we won't be able to reach a mutually acceptable price.  It's better to sell to John now and guarantee myself a decent profit."
