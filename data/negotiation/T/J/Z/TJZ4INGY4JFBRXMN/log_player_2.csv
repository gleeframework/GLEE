"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

* **Alice's offer is also good for Alice:** She's making a profit of $2,000, which is more than her minimum desired profit ($8,000).

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the optimal choice for Bob."
