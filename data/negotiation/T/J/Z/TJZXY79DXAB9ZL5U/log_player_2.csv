Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, it's still above my maximum of $120.  I'm going to try and negotiate with Alice to get a better deal.  If I can't, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $115. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our desired prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get it for $120. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, as I have a few more rounds to work with. If things don't look promising, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to stick with my maximum price of $120. This is my final offer, and if Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $122 is still slightly above my budget. I've only got 5 rounds left, and I don't want to risk her continuing to reject my offers. I'd rather go with John's offer and secure the product at my desired price."
