"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While $1,750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still quite a ways off from what I have in mind.  I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
