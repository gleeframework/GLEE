"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still reflects the value of the product to Bob.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but it's always better to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product at a substantial loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum value, and I'm hoping it will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable with selling for less than my minimum value of $1,000,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum value of $1,000,000.  At this point, I'm not willing to go lower, as I'm already at my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept my offer."
