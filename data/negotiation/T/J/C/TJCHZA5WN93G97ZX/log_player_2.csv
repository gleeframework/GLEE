"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate downwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's starting price.  Starting with a lower counteroffer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer and provides a reason for the counteroffer. This sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $11,500 is still significantly higher than her value of $8,000. We have leverage to negotiate further.
* **Avoid Rushing:** We're only in Round 3, and rushing to accept might cause us to miss out on a better deal. 
* **John is our Safety Net:** We can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations stall or become unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm getting closer to what I can do, but $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving in smaller increments now to signal that we're getting closer to our limit while still aiming for a price well below her last offer.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  Highlighting ""fair compromise"" emphasizes that we are willing to negotiate but want a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We haven't accepted her ""middle ground,"" keeping the pressure on Alice to continue moving towards our desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $10,500.  Let's settle at $11,000, my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic to try and force our hand. It's unlikely this truly is her absolute lowest price.
* **Potential for More:**  We've consistently brought the price down with each round. It's worth seeing if we can push a little further, even if it's just a small amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The difference between $11,000 and our target price is significant enough to justify at least one more counteroffer. We're still well below John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet that number.  Would you be willing to do $10,750? That's the best I can offer."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging ""Final Offer"":**  We recognize her tactic but don't give in completely.
* **Small Concession:** Our counteroffer is a very small increase from our previous offer, signaling we're nearing our limit but still open to a deal.
* **Firm but Respectful:**  We stand our ground on price but maintain a respectful tone to avoid jeopardizing the negotiation.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By presenting our absolute maximum, we subtly introduce a sense of urgency for Alice to accept."
