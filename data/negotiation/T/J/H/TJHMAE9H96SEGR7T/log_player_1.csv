Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $900000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
