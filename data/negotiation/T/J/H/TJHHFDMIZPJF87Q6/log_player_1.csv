{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit above your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows the negotiation to progress and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is more than the $8,000 you'd get from John, it's still less than your ideal price.  You have room to negotiate a better price with Bob, so rejecting his offer and counter-offering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
