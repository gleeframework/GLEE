"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** By offering $8,500, Bob is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for Alice to potentially counter with a price closer to Bob's offer.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" Option:** For now, Bob is avoiding buying from John at $10,000, as he believes he can potentially secure a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Price:** Alice's offer of $9,000 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $10,000, and importantly, it's less than the product's worth to him. This makes it a good deal.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuously counter-offering could drag out the process and potentially lead to a stalemate or a higher price from Alice.
* **Avoiding John:** Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
