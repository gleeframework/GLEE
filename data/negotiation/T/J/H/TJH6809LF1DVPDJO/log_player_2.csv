{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $13,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems pretty firm on a price that is significantly higher than John's offer. It's unlikely she'll budge much lower than $15,000.  While there are rounds left to negotiate, it's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John at $10,000."
