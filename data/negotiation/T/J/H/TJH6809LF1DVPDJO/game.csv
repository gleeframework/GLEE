"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from that number.  Would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $13,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it seriously.",16000.0,Alice,5,
