Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand where you're coming from, but to be honest, $7,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make my final offer at $9,500. This is a significant discount and reflects my desire to find a solution that works for us both.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,500, and you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal."
