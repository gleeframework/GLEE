"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $780,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $820,000? This would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $820,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
