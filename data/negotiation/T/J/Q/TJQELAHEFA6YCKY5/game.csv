"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $135? It's a fair price that I think we can both be happy with.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we say $140? It's a bit above my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $135.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $145. How about we say $142? It's a bit above my minimum, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from $140.",142.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, but $142 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $130, which would be $136. Can you consider that?",136.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're really close, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $145. However, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession this time. How about we say $138? It's a bit above my minimum, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from $136.",138.0,Alice,9,
