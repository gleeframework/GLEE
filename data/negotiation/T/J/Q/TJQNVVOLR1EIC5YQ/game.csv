"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired sale price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession to reach an agreement. I can offer you a price of $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your need to get a fair price, $1,225,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise considering our respective valuations. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
