Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm looking for.  Could you consider something closer to $18,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a strict budget in mind. How about $9,500?  This is a fair offer considering I could get it elsewhere for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still significantly below the $15,000 fallback option with John. Bob revealing he'd pay $10,000 is useful information, but we need to incentivize him to move closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the back and forth. I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to be fair to myself. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $16,500? This acknowledges the value you see while ensuring I get a reasonable price."",
""product_price"": 16500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims for a compromise, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate but not drastically drop the price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're still significantly above his $9,500 offer, but closer to his perceived value of $10,000. This gives us room to negotiate down if needed while staying above our guaranteed $15,000. 
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, a more assertive approach is necessary to avoid running out of time and being forced to accept John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  To be honest, I have a standing offer for $10,000 from another seller.  If you can meet that, I'll buy it from you right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has presented what's likely his final offer. He's confirmed he's willing to pay $10,000 and has an alternative option.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Waiting longer might force us to accept John's offer, losing out on potential profit.
* **Profitable Outcome:** While not ideal, $10,000 is still a reasonable profit above our minimum acceptable price. 

Accepting Bob's offer at $10,000 secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
