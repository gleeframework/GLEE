"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm looking for.  Could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a strict budget in mind. How about $9,500?  This is a fair offer considering I could get it elsewhere for $10,000.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the back and forth. I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to be fair to myself. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $16,500? This acknowledges the value you see while ensuring I get a reasonable price.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  To be honest, I have a standing offer for $10,000 from another seller.  If you can meet that, I'll buy it from you right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
