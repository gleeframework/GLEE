"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $120 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm still hoping to find a way to purchase the product without exceeding $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate further? Perhaps we could aim for $120 if there are any additional discounts or promotions available?",120.0,Bob,4,
