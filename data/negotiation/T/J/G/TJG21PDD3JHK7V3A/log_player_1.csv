"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open Communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, creating a dialogue and showing I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would mean losing a significant amount of money.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even though Bob's initial offer is low, his interest in the product is clear. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to give up without trying. 
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 10 rounds, and selling to John is always an option if negotiations fail.  I'm better off taking the time to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer by lowering my price, but I'm still above his offer, showing I'm not desperate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm emphasizing that this is ""still a great deal"" to remind Bob of the product's worth. 
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm using positive language (""let's see if we can find common ground"") to keep the dialogue open and collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Future Gains:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $15,000, accepting this offer now ensures a profit and leaves room for future negotiation if I were to sell similar products to Bob in the future.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to more rounds and potentially a deal with John, but this offer is good enough, and I'm not willing to risk losing the sale altogether."
