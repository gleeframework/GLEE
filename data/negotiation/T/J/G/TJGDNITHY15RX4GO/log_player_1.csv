Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $150 is a significant markup, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. This way, even if you have to come down a little, you're still likely to get a price higher than $120.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value rather than focusing solely on the price. This can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, there's no risk of losing money."
