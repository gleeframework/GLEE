"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value, hoping to get a good starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $15 margin gives me space to negotiate down if needed, but still allows me to make a decent profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While $105 is a lower price, it's still above my minimum of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still room to negotiate higher, and Bob has shown interest.
* **Learning Bob's Value:** This round helps me understand Bob's perceived value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $115 to $110, but still maintaining a profit.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm highlighting that $110 is a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chance of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you try to meet me at $105 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  $105 is still below my minimum price of $120.  I need to try to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  There are still several rounds left, and Bob is showing interest. This gives me room to negotiate further. 
* **Understanding Bob's Budget:** Bob is clearly price-sensitive and is sticking to his budget. I'll need to tailor my next offer to his limits, but still aim for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you loud and clear about your budget. How about we split the difference? $107.50 is a fair price, and it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By proposing $107.50, I'm offering a compromise that meets Bob halfway between his offer and my previous counteroffer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing that $107.50 is still a good deal for both of us, reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""What do you say?"" adds a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you try to meet me at $105 again? I'm willing to make a final offer, and I really hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum price of $120. 
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  There is very little room to negotiate further without risking a loss.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  John is willing to pay $120, which is a much better deal than selling to Bob at $105. The risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential loss of $15.

It's time to accept John's offer and secure a higher price."
