"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 105. How about we meet in the middle at 115? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as 110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 115 and 110, which is 112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
