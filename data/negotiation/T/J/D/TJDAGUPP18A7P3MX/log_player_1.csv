``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value of $100, but also gives Bob room to negotiate and allows for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $110 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your minimum value of $120. You can reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the offer, but I'm going to need to go a little higher than $110. How about $115?  That's a great price for such a fantastic product!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I can only offer $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum value, but it's the best you've gotten so far. Given that you can sell to John for $100, accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit and avoids further negotiation."
