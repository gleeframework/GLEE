"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product but would be happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks again, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  $120 is still a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I'm really hoping to make this work.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $110 is still a little out of my reach.  If you're willing to come down to $100, I'd be happy to purchase it right now.  If not, I'll have to consider my other options.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $100 is a tough ask for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $105, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Alice,7,
