"Hi Alice,  $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with this price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to pay $107.50, which is closer to our target.  Let's get this deal done!",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with this product.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $109 is still a bit too high. How about we settle at $108? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,6,
