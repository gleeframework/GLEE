"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still making a decent profit.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired value of $12,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm  countering with $12,500,  a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to earn at least $12,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer again and try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000.  This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and finally agree to buy it.  I have John as a backup, but I'd rather sell to Bob if possible."
