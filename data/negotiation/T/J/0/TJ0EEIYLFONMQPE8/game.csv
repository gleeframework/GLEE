"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. Let's meet in the middle at $14,500. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be able to make a profit with that price.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $15,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",15200.0,Alice,5,
