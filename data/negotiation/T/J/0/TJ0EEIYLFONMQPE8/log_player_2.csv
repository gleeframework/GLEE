"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this fantastic item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating or buy from John for a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. Let's meet in the middle at $14,500. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be able to make a profit with that price."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $15,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.

Bob should buy from John. Alice's final offer is still too high for Bob, and he can get the same product for a lower price from John.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice at this point."
