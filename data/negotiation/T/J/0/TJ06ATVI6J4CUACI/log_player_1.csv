{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a good deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, Bob values the product at $1,500,000. There's a potential profit margin to explore.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit above our minimum. This price also gives Bob a compelling incentive to buy now rather than risk missing out.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The mention of John is irrelevant in the direct negotiation with Bob.  Bringing him up could weaken Alice's position."
