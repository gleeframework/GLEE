"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is too high. You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There are 10 rounds, so you have time to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for me. I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation. I have time (9 rounds left) to work towards my desired price point, and I don't want to settle for a price that is too far above my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would give you a decent profit, and it fits within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer. However, I am still aiming to save more money. I have 6 rounds remaining, so I can continue to negotiate with Alice. The goal is to get the price closer to my ideal price point before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your latest offer, $825,000 is still slightly out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $810,000. This would be a good deal for both of us - you'd still make a healthy profit, and I'd get a fair price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 810000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $810,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $815,000. While this is still higher than my ideal price of $800,000, I've only got 4 rounds left.  There's a real risk that I won't be able to get a lower price with further negotiation, and I don't want to risk having to buy from John at $1,500,000.  Accepting Alice's offer at $815,000 is a good compromise, saving me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
