Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would give you a decent profit, and it fits within my budget.  What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
