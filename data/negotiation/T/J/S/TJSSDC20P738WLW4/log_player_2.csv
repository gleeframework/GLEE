"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe you might find valuable. I'm thinking of a price of $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While you are willing to spend up to $120, Alice's offer of $110 is still too close to your maximum.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer, hopefully bringing the price down closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While $95 is tempting, I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you consider $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $105 is still closer to her value than yours.
* **More room for negotiation:**  You have several rounds left to keep negotiating. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Rejecting the offer keeps you in control and allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I want to find a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
