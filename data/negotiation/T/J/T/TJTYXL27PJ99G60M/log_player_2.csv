"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120, and Alice is offering it at $120, there's no potential for saving money by negotiating.  You're better off just buying from John, as you're guaranteed to get the product at your maximum price."
