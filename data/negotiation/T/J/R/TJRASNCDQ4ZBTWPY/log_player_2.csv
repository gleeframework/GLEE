"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's well below its true market value. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
