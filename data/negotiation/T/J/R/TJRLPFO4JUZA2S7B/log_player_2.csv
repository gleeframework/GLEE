"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still higher than John's offer. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for Alice to come down further. Rejecting allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target. Would you consider $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach your target, but I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $1,090,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is now within Bob's budget and only $90,000 more than what John is selling the product for.  This is a good compromise that saves Bob money compared to John's offer, and it's also a price Alice is willing to accept."
