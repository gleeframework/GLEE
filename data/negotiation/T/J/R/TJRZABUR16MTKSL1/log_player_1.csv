Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information you've provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is strong, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, so you can be a bit bolder with your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start a bit lower to allow for counter-offers.
* **Product Urgency:** If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be more appealing.
