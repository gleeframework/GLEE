"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $725,000. I can offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
