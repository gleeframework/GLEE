"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $990000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.
