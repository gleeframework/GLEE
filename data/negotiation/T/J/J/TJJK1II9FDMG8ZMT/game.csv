I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-end item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $25000 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in?,25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $22000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $22000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $19500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",19500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can offer it to you for $20500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",20500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can offer it to you for $20000. This is my final compromise, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. Let's make a deal!",20000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $20000, Bob. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. If you're not willing to meet me at $20000, I'm not sure I'm interested in continuing the conversation.",20000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower than $20000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $18000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",18000.0,Bob,10,
