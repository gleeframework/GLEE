Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is within my budget of $120 and is close to my initial counteroffer of $105.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
