"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'd pay elsewhere and still gives you a good profit.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $850,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as you'd still be making a profit and I'd be getting a great deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I see we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, $800,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $900,000, which is the same price I offered initially. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on $900,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  Let's try one last time: I'm offering $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs - it allows you to make a reasonable profit and gives me a great deal.  If you accept, we can finalize the transaction.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $825,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm going to make one final offer: $950,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
