"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  $900,000 is still more than what the product is worth to me ($1,200,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  I can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and counter-offering."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's better than her initial offer, $850,000 is still a significant amount more than my ideal price.
* **I'm closer to a deal.** The fact that Alice is willing to negotiate shows she's motivated to sell. 
* **More room to bargain.**  I can try to lower the price further with another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, $800,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $900,000, which is the same price I offered initially. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is stuck at $900,000.** She's essentially back to her initial offer, showing she might not be willing to go lower.
* **I'm still within my budget.**  While $900,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still within my limit of $1,200,000. 
* **One more counteroffer could work.** I can try one more time to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to budge slightly if she sees I'm serious about finding a fair deal."

I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm going to make one final offer: $950,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer is too high.**  $950,000 is beyond my comfort zone and getting closer to John's price.
* **Negotiation is stalled.**  Alice is firm on her price, and I've reached my limit for counteroffers. 
* **John is a better option.**  While it's not ideal to pay John's price, it's a safer choice than risking further negotiations with Alice.  There's no guarantee she'll budge, and I could end up with nothing."
