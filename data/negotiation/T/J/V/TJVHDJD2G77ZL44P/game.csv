"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget though. Could you consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $12,000? That's a significant drop from my initial offer and reflects my desire to make this work.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is getting closer, but it's still a stretch for me. How about we settle at $10,500? That's my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,
