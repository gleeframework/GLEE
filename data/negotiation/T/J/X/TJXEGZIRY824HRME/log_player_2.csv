# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95.  While this is a better price than John's, you can still do better by rejecting and negotiating with Alice or finding another seller."
