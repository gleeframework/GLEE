"While I appreciate your offer, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $12500.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I would be able to purchase the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $13000. It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
