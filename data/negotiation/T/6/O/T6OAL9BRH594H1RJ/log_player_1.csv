Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (the least you'll accept)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **John's Value:** $1,500,000 (your guaranteed backup)

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price. This means you don't have to settle for anything less than $1,500,000. 

The key is to propose a price to Bob that's attractive enough for him to accept, but also maximizes your profit. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps it professional and positive, highlighting the product's value.
* **The Price:**  $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. Here's why:
    * It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving you room for negotiation if needed.
    * It offers Bob a potential profit of $150,000 if he were to utilize the product effectively, making it enticing.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher (e.g., $1,400,000).
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price from Bob to avoid delays.

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust the price slightly based on Bob's response."
