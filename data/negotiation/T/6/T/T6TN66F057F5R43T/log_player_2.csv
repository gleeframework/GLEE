"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for less. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, which is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,200,000.  At $1,300,000, Bob is still getting a good deal, saving $100,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that Alice might reject another counteroffer, and Bob could end up buying from John for a higher price. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
