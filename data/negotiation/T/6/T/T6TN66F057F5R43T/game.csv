"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
