Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000), but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. I've highlighted the value to him to increase his incentive. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first offer. I'll be watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly.
* I'm keeping the option to sell to John as a fallback, ensuring I can secure at least $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to you and allows for a good profit margin.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a lot closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since he's already acknowledged the product's value to him. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below his initial valuation. This will show him I'm willing to negotiate while demonstrating that I'm confident in the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  Given the product's potential value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $1,100,000 is a significant move closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still well above my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating confidence in the product's value.
* **Message:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, aiming to subtly increase his willingness to pay more. I also frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage a positive response.

**Strategy:**

By meeting him halfway, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept my counteroffer. If he still refuses, I'll continue to adjust my offers based on his responses, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential sale to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to you and allows for a good profit margin.  Let's try to close this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from his initial offer of $950,000 and is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to secure a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a strong profit and avoids the risk of a further negotiation with Bob or selling to John at a lower price."
