"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you about this opportunity. This product is truly unique and holds immense value. I'm happy to offer it to you for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to give myself room for negotiation. It's easier to come down in price than to go up. 
* **Significantly Above Both Valuations:**  The price is significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives a wide range for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, setting a positive tone for the negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate its uniqueness, I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. It's only Round 2, and I have time to try and secure a better deal.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's stated price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product holds significant value beyond that, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession by coming down $300,000 from my initial offer. This signals flexibility while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""true worth"" reinforces the product's value and justifies the high price point.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm still significantly above both my minimum and Bob's offer, allowing room for further negotiation if needed.

Let's see how Bob responds to this revised offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $1,700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. I'm still above my minimum and have some leverage. While $1,700,000 is tempting, I want to push for a bit more in the next round or two before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm coming down another $100,000, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** Framing it as a ""fair price"" emphasizes mutual benefit and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Simplified Language:** I'm keeping the message concise and less focused on justifications, as we're getting closer to a potential deal. 

This offer puts some pressure on Bob while still leaving me in a reasonable position. Let's see his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued cooperation. I am willing to consider $1,750,000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,750,000 is a good deal. It's significantly above my minimum and a solid return on the product. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are getting smaller and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows me to re-invest the earnings sooner.

Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and this offer represents a fair compromise for both of us. It's time to accept and move forward."
