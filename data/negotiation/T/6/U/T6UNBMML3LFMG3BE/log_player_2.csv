"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $120
* **Your Maximum:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $30 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her rejecting a counter-offer means accepting her current offer is the most financially beneficial option."
