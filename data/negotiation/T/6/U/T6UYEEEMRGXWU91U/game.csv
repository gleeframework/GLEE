"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you think the product is worth $800,000, but I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
