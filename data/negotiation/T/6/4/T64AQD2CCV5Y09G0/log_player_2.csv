You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality. However, $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I propose a price of $110 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still within my budget and closer to my desired price point.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my next counteroffer, and I could end up paying more from John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a deal at a reasonable price."
