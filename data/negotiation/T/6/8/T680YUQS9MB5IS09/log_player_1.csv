Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. Aiming for a significant margin above Bob's perceived value increases your potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection of its worth"" subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind.
* **Open to negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to negotiate down towards a favorable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving you the option to secure a sale with John if Bob declines."
