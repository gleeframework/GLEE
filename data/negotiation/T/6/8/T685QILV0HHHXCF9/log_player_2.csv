"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $10,000
* **Your Maximum:** $8,000
* **John's Offer:** $8,000

While Alice's offer might be tempting, you know John will sell you the product for $2,000 less.  There's no need to spend more than your maximum budget when you have a guaranteed better deal elsewhere."
