Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but we have a good buffer before hitting our minimum price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives us leverage. We don't need to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, increasing the chances of a successful sale at a price that benefits Alice significantly."
