Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""open to hearing your thoughts,"" you signal that you're willing to negotiate, which can make Bob feel more comfortable making a counter-offer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Bob might value the product more than you know, or he might be in a situation where convenience is worth a premium.  This first offer helps you gauge his interest.

**Important Note:**  While I'm starting with $150, be prepared to potentially go down a bit in price if Bob counters. The goal is to maximize profit, but also to secure the sale rather than risk losing it to John."
