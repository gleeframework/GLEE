"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is the amount it's worth to you, so we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum price, it makes sense to accept. There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal by counter-offering, and buying from John offers no advantage."
