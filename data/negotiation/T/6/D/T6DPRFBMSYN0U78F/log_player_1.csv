Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter if necessary. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to participate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. I can use this to try and negotiate a higher price.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're trying to stay within your budget. I can't go all the way down to $8,000, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** I'm offering $8,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain negotiation:** The message emphasizes fairness and encourages further discussion.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The language is friendly and collaborative to keep the negotiation going. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while maintaining a position of strength."
