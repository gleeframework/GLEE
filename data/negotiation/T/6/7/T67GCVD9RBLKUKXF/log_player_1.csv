"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product at a price of $2,000,000. It's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not setting an unrealistic price, but leaving room for negotiation to hopefully reach a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and express his interest. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while allowing for flexibility in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does show that he's interested in the product. There's room for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000,  which is still a good deal for a product of this caliber. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation flowing.

**Goal:**  This counteroffer aims to meet Bob halfway while ensuring I receive a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, the gap between our desired prices is still significant.  Further concessions from my side would likely be too costly. 
* **John is a Safer Option:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 would ensure I get my minimum, and there's a possibility of a better offer from Bob in the future. 

**Next Steps:** I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if our negotiations don't lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $1,250,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,500,000. This is a fair price, and it's the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a reasonable return.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is exactly halfway between my minimum price of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $1,250,000.  This demonstrates a strong commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Strong Justification:**  I reiterate the value of the product while still stating my lowest possible price. 
* **Direct Approach:**  I'm keeping the message concise and direct, focusing on finding a solution.

**Goal:**  This counteroffer aims to close the deal while ensuring I reach my minimum desired price. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1500000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1350000. This is the absolute highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a chance that further negotiation could lead to a better price, but there's also a risk that Bob might not be willing to budge further.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum, and there's a significant chance that I won't be able to get a better offer from Bob.

**Decision:**  Given the limited time remaining and the certainty of John's offer, I choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
