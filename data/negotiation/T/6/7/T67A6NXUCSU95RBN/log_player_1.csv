"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, and leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value the product provides to Bob.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price of $80, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $95.  It's still a great price for you, and a good middle ground for us both."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's counteroffer of $90.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a good profit."
