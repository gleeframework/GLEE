{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's close to Alice's minimum value ($8,000) but leaves some room for negotiation. A $8,500 offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,800 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Since Alice is willing to negotiate further, Bob should continue to try and drive the price down. There's still potential to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $9,800 but still above her desired selling price of $8,000.  This shows a compromise and potential for an agreement, while still keeping a lower price than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over her previous offer of $9,800 and is still lower than the $12,000 Bob would pay to John. Accepting the offer allows Bob to save money and avoid further negotiations."
