"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $950000. Considering the value I have in mind, I'd like to counter with $1100000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's worth. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. How about $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1050000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $1025000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to make one last push, so I'll counter with $1080000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best we can do. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
