"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking for $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my own costs.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to finalize this deal at $1,010,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,010,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,030,000. This is the last offer I'm willing to make, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
