Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't logically pay more than that.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but leave some room for negotiation and still entice Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting the product's value, setting a positive tone.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still being a significant gain for you.
* **Confident Justification:** By stating it's a fair offer, you anchor the price in Bob's mind without being overly aggressive. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob will likely counter-offer. Be ready to lower your price slightly, but stay firm above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Consider Bob's Perspective:**  Understanding his needs and constraints can help you tailor your message and find a mutually agreeable price."
