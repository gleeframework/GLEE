"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point.  You're aiming to get the product for under $150, and this offer leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $125? I'm ready to buy it if we can agree on that price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, but you're still aiming for a better deal.  Since you have more rounds to negotiate, it's worth continuing to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $127.50 is getting closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $126? It's a small difference, but it makes a big difference to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 126}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $126 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to go down to $128, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you're still hoping to get the product for a bit less, Alice has come down to $128. This is within your budget, and you're nearing the halfway point of the rounds. Accepting avoids risking further negotiation and ensures you get the product at a reasonable price. It's better to secure the deal now than to risk losing out on the product entirely."
