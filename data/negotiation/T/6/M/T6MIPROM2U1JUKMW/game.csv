"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $125? I'm ready to buy it if we can agree on that price.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",127.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $127.50 is getting closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $126? It's a small difference, but it makes a big difference to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",126.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $126 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to go down to $128, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,
