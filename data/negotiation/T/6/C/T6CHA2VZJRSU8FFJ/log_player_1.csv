"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" hinting at reasons why the price is high without revealing your bottom line.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  By stating  ""I'm open to discussing this further,"" Alice signals a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in a multi-round process. 

This initial offer is a starting point. How Bob responds will determine Alice's next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is quite high for me at the moment. I'm more interested in a price closer to $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000).  While his counteroffer is aggressive, it indicates that he's interested. You have plenty of room to negotiate upwards, especially knowing John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 is significantly below what I can consider for this product. To be frank, I have other options for selling it at a much higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Alice acknowledges Bob's counteroffer but stands firm on her price, indicating it's a significant reduction and potentially her ""final offer."" 
* **Introducing Competition:** By mentioning ""other options,"" Alice subtly creates a sense of urgency and competition, implying that Bob might lose the deal if he doesn't act soon.
* **Strategic Price:** Dropping the price by $300,000 might seem like a lot, but it's a calculated move to gauge Bob's flexibility and keep the negotiation moving while staying well above her minimum.

This approach aims to:

1. **Test Bob's Resolve:** Will he counter again, and if so, by how much?
2. **Maintain Control:** Alice is setting the pace and tone of the negotiation.
3. **Keep the Option Open:** Alice wants to see if a mutually beneficial deal is possible before going with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but  $2,000,000 is still too far from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
