"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is quite high for me at the moment. I'm more interested in a price closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 is significantly below what I can consider for this product. To be frank, I have other options for selling it at a much higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but  $2,000,000 is still too far from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? ",1400000.0,Bob,4,
