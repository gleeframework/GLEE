"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
