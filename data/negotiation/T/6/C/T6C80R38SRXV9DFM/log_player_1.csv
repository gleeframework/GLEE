Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible. Since the product is worth $10,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept the offer even if it's above his initial valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price significantly higher than John's offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal if Alice lowers the price slightly.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, Alice might need to adjust her approach in subsequent interactions."
