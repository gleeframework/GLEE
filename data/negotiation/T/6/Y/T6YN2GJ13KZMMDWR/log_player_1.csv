{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation, but also ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'm leaving room for negotiation because I know Bob is a potential buyer, and I want to close the deal. However, I'm also aware of John's offer, which sets my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Although I want to secure a sale, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but I need to keep in mind John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, and it's clear he's not willing to budge further.  I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to start over with another buyer.  Accepting his offer is the most practical choice in this situation."
