Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's maximum allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum price.

By offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed purchase, Alice increases her chances of securing a  deal that's more profitable than her fallback option."
