{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it is less than what Alice would get from John. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also gives Alice a good starting point to potentially earn more than her minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what Alice would like to get, but still above her minimum acceptable price.  It's worth seeing if she can get closer to her desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $145?  It's still a great price for a product worth more, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a lower offer of $125. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for Alice, and although she can make another counteroffer, it's unlikely she'll get him to budge much further.  Since John is willing to pay Alice's minimum acceptable price of $150, it's the best decision to sell the product to John."
