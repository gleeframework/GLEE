"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $100, and I can potentially get closer to that price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I can't go down to $85, I'm willing to come down to $95. That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $95 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hopeful I can get a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can push it to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's just a small step away from your last offer."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
