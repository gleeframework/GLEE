"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I can't go down to $85, I'm willing to come down to $95. That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your offer. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $95 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's just a small step away from your last offer.",92.5,Alice,5,
