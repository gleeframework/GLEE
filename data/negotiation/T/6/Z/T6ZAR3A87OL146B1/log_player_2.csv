"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150**. 
* **It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $130 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $125? It's the maximum I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $150.** 
* **You can still try to negotiate a lower price.** Even though you only have 7 rounds left, you're still in a good position to negotiate.  It's possible Alice might be willing to come down further.
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's not the best value.** You're trying to get the best price, and John's price is higher than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $132.50. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget of $150.**  This is a good price for you.
* **You've already rejected two counteroffers, and Alice has also lowered her price.** This suggests that further negotiation might be difficult.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but it's more expensive.** It's better to take advantage of this offer from Alice.
* **You have 5 rounds left, which is enough time to reconsider if you're unhappy with the purchase.**  You can always try to negotiate with Alice again later if you change your mind."
