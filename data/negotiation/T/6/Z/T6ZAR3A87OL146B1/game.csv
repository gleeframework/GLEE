Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think?,130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $130 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $125? It's the maximum I can afford right now.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $132.50. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
