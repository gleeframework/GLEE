"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This price reflects the significant value and potential it holds.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. I'm willing to take on the risk of purchasing the product at this price, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  While $600000 is a significant amount, it unfortunately doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging your financial constraints.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $725000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
