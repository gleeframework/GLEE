Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $135."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. This strategy aims to:

* **Initiate negotiation:**  Show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** A $15 difference allows for a few rounds of bargaining without immediately hitting my minimum.
* **Keep John as a backup:** I haven't sold to John yet, so I can still pivot if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I want to secure a sale, I'm not willing to accept a loss on the product. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to go down to $130. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer is still below my desired price point.  I'm not willing to risk a continued stalemate, and I'd rather secure the sale with John for a price I'm comfortable with."
