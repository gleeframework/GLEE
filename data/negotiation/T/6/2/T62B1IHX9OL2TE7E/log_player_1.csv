Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $105?  That would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sure you understand that this product is worth a lot more to you than $95.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any lower than $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 100}

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the time is running out and I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold. I've made significant concessions, but Bob is still pushing for a lower price. To guarantee I make at least my minimum, I'll sell the product to John for $80."
