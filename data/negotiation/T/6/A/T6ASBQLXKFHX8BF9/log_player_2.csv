"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value to us, but we believe its true worth lies in the hands of someone like yourself who can appreciate and utilize it to its full potential. We are offering this product to you at a special price of $800,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to its intrinsic value, making it an attractive proposition for you. We understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and we aim to bridge the gap while ensuring both parties benefit. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($1,000,000) and also saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. This is a good deal for you, so you should accept it."
