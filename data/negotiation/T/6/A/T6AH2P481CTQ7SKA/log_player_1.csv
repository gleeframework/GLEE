{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a price that is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for potential negotiation while ensuring I don't lose out on a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I will reject his counteroffer and proceed to the next round. I will aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it still ensures a profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
