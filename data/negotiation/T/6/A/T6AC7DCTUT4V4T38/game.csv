"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, I understand where you're coming from. To be honest, $7,000 is cutting it quite close to the lowest I can go.  How about we split the difference again at $8,500 and we have a deal?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm getting close to my limit. How about we settle at $7,500 and call it a deal?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is very close, but to be completely frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be fair to myself.  If you're able to meet me at $8,250, I'm willing to close the deal right now.",8250.0,Alice,7,
