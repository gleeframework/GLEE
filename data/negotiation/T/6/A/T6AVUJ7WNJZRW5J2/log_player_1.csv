Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $15,000? I'd like to make an offer of $16,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $16,000 is a better deal than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
