Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,500 is a strong offer that's still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to my $15,000 minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can confidently sell to John at my desired price."
