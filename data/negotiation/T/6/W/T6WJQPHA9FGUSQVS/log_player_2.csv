"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let's make this a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob has a goal to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to achieve this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's starting counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This shows a strong desire to negotiate and establishes a lower starting point for further discussion.  It's important to keep in mind that Bob can always go to John, but he's trying to maximize his savings.  A $200,000 difference from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is still aiming for a lower price and has several rounds remaining to make a counteroffer and try to find a more favorable deal.  He's not desperate to close the deal immediately, so rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a lower price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer by $50,000 from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. This also sets up a potential for a ""final offer"" scenario in the next round where either Alice accepts or Bob goes to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. There are 5 rounds remaining and  he's  not feeling pressured to make a decision just yet. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to get a lower price. By stating this is his ""final offer,"" he's putting pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal.  Bob is getting closer to his ideal price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting."
