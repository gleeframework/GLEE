{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I appreciate his willingness to compromise, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my desired price and represents a good deal for me. There's a good chance that further negotiation will only lead to a lower price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale."
