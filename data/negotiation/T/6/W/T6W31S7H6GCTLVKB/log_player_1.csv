"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I get a decent profit. I'm also hoping to gauge Bob's interest level based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it right away.  Bob's offer is very low, and I want to see if I can get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm offering $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
