"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit high for me, though.  How about $115?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",125.0,Alice,5,
