"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find common ground here.  While $1,150,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still limited to a maximum of $1,000,000. This would be a significant purchase for me, and I'm confident that this product will be immensely valuable. If we can reach this price point, I'm ready to finalize the deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
