Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that might interest you for $150. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
