"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $7,750 isn't quite enough. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $8,250.  This is the best I can do, and I hope you see the value it represents for you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
