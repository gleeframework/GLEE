"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 180 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on 160? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $130. How about we split the difference at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 160 and 135, which would be 145. It's a fair price for a high-quality product like this, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",145.0,Alice,5,
