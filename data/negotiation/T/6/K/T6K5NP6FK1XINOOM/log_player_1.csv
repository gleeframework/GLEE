Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is a good compromise. It's slightly above my minimum and gets me closer to my desired price.  It's better than selling to John at $12,000, and I'm starting to run out of rounds."
