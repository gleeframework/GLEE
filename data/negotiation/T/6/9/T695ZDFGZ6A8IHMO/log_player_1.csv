"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to give myself room to negotiate down. This price is closer to Bob's perceived value than mine, increasing the chances he'll engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,300,000 offer allows for significant negotiation while staying well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I want to create a collaborative and positive atmosphere to encourage Bob to work towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a great product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still substantially less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. Bob's counter-offer suggests there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to counter in hopes of finding a middle ground closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,200,000? This reflects the true value while recognizing your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but holding firm on my position that $1,000,000 is too low.
* **Meeting Halfway:** The $1,200,000 counter-offer splits the difference between his offer and my previous price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially nudge Bob closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,150,000 is a significant profit above my minimum price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating serious interest and willingness to close the deal.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now secures a great price without risking further negotiation or potentially losing Bob as a buyer. While I might be able to push for a bit more, the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it at this point."
