"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However,  $16,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it. How about $14,000?  This would be my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible. Given that you said your last offer was $14,000,  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,6,
