I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which has been meticulously designed and crafted to exceed all your expectations.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is being a bit theatrical in her description, the offer of $1,200,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the guaranteed price from John. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
