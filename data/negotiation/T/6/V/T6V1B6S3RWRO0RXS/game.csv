"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while also allowing me to recoup some of my investment. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to recoup your investment, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is the same price I mentioned in my initial counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
