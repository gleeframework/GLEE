# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you. Considering its potential to generate $1,000,000 in value for your business, I'm offering it to you for $950,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.
