"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraint. While I can't go as low as $10,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000?  This reflects the value of the product for you, while also ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. $11,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I hope you'll consider this as a sign of good faith and accept this offer. If not, I'll have to accept another offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
