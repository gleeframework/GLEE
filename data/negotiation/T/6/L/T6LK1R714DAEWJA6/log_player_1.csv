"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum. While I could accept and still make a profit, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me. How about $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm trying to be reasonable and show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  $115 is still above my minimum, but it's closer to his offer.  I'm hoping this will convince him to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is a profit for me, it's still significantly lower than my minimum goal and not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our conversation but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go down to $110, which is a fair compromise considering what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm trying to be firm but still open to negotiation. I'm coming down a bit, but $110 is still above my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I respect your decision. I would like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to my minimum, but with only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get Bob to go higher.  John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is a better outcome for me.  I'm going to sell to John."
