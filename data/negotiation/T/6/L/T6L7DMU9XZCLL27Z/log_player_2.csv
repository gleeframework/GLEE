Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a good compromise. It's likely that further negotiations will be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly lower price. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
