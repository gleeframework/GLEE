"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,500? I'm really interested in this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can do $10,500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I really want to make this work, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,5,
