"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially land within your budget.
* **Leaving Room:** My ideal price is much lower than Alice's starting point. This counteroffer leaves substantial room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Justified:**  The message is polite, acknowledges Alice's offer, and provides a brief justification for the lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not there yet:** Alice has moved closer to my range, but her price is still higher than John's.
* **Potential for a better deal:** It's worth seeing if I can get Alice closer to $8,000 before resorting to buying from John. There's a chance she might be willing to accept a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,250. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in the product."",
""product_price"": 7250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between her current offer ($8,500) and my previous counteroffer ($6,000).  It signals willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below my limit.
* **Strong Interest:** The message emphasizes my interest in the product, which might make Alice more inclined to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps me in the negotiation while still leaving me with the option to go with John if Alice remains inflexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $8,000 for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,625?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would make both of us happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings with Further Negotiation:** Alice is firm on getting at least $8,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal. The potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of Alice walking away.
* **Acceptable Price:**  $7,625 is a reasonable compromise. It's below my $8,000 limit and a decent discount from her original asking price. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on. Accepting now secures the product and avoids potentially losing out on it altogether."
