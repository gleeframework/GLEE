"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,250. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in the product.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $8,000 for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,625?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would make both of us happy.",7625.0,Alice,5,
