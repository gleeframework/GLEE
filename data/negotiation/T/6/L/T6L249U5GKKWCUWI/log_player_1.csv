Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,200,000) than it is to you.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance to make a deal with Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation gives him a good deal while still earning you a significant profit.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's friendly, acknowledges the product's value to Bob, and positions the price as fair. 
* **The Price: ** $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a $100,000 gain compared to his valuation, making it highly likely he'll accept. This price also earns you a $300,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. You could try aiming higher, but there's a risk of Bob rejecting the offer, leading you to the lower, guaranteed sale."
