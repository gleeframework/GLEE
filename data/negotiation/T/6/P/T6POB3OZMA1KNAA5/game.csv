"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is also a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,500, which would be $8,250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
