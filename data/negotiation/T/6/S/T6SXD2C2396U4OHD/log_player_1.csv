Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's more than your minimum:**  You're selling for $100, which is $20 more than your minimum price of $80. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:** Bob values the product at $120, so he's still getting a good deal at $100. 
* **It minimizes risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell the product to John for $80, ensuring you don't lose money."
