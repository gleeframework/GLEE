"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **More information is needed.**  You don't know the value of the product to Alice. A counteroffer will give you insight into her willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:** Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process. You'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  You're aiming for a significant discount ($2000) but are still within the range of your maximum budget.
* **Shows interest:**  You acknowledge Alice's offer and express interest in the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies you're open to compromise, which encourages continued negotiation.

This counteroffer allows you to see how far Alice is willing to go to make a deal, while still staying within your price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.**  She's dropped from $12,000 to $11,500, which is a significant concession.
* **The price is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so $11,500 is a good deal.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings.** While you could try for a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John is too high.

**Strategy:**  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a decent price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
