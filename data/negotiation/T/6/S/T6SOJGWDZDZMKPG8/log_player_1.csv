Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:**  I need at least $10,000 for the product, as that's what I'd get from John.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price that is slightly above my minimum, but still significantly below Bob's maximum, leaving room for potential negotiation if he counter-offers. This increases my chances of getting a better price than my guaranteed $10,000."
