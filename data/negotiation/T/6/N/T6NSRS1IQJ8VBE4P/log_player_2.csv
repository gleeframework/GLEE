Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me. Could you do $9,000?"",

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle on $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

}
```

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our previous counter-offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! I can do $10,200, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm, and this price is getting close enough to my limit that it's not worth the risk of her backing out.  $10,200 is a reasonable deal."
