"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
