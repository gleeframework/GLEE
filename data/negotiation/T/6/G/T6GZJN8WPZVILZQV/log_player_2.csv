"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's no reason to accept the offer on the first round, as there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you being open to negotiation. While I see the value in the product,  $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point.  Bob has room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to close this."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,900. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is still above Bob's budget.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, it's getting close to the end of the rounds, and there's a risk that the negotiation could drag on and result in a higher final price.  It's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to purchase the product from John at the fixed price of $10,000."
