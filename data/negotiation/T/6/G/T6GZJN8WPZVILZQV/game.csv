"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you being open to negotiation. While I see the value in the product,  $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to close this.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,900. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.",10900.0,Alice,5,
