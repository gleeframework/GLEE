You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000 and both Alice and John are offering the product for that price, it doesn't matter who Bob buys from.  Accepting Alice's offer is the same as buying from John, as both options result in the same price."
