"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation so far.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows me to make a good profit while providing you with a valuable product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000 for the product. I think this price is more reasonable and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable at that price point.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's wrap this up.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still not willing to budge, Alice, but I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. I'm willing to make one more offer: $880,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,6,
