Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is still less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and inviting to a discussion.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a good price and above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's offer indicates he's willing to pay a bit more, and I want to try and secure a price closer to my initial offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob!  I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's a significant increase from his initial counteroffer, and it's only $5 less than my last counteroffer.  It's a good deal for me considering that I can always fall back on selling to John for $80.  It's time to take the deal and move on!"
