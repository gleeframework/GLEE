"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $10,500 is a considerable reduction from Alice's initial price of $12,000.  This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer of $12,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price.  Bob is determined to get the best possible deal, and rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating.  There's still a chance to get a lower price, especially since Alice already rejected his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to compromise slightly but still wants a good deal. Offering $11,000 represents a middle ground between Alice's offer and his previous counteroffer. It's a reasonable price that shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also pushes Alice to reconsider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price point, but Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within his budget. It's a good compromise, and further negotiations might lead to a stalemate or a prolonged process.  It's better for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risking further delays or ending up paying more to John."
