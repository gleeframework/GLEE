"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,900. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
