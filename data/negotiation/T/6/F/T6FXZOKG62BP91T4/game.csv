"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $10800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $10800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
