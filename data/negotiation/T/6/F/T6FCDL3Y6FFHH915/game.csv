"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 simply won't work for me.  It's significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,150,000? That's still a fair price considering the value to you, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and should be a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make this deal work. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
