"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's true value, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 simply won't work for me.  It's significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,150,000? That's still a fair price considering the value to you, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price again.  It's likely that Alice is willing to negotiate further since she rejected your counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and should be a good compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make this deal work. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While you could continue to negotiate, it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept a lower price, and you risk prolonging the negotiation. Since John is offering the product for your maximum budget, it's more efficient and less risky to purchase from John."
