"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $102.50? That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know what you think.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $97.50 is a fair offer. Can we meet at $99? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to keep it under $100.",99.0,Bob,6,
