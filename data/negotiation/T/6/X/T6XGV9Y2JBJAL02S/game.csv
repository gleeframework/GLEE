"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point.  I'd be happy to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. We believe in maintaining a fair market value for our assets. To continue our discussion, I am proposing a revised price of $1,300,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to its value to you, while ensuring we maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
