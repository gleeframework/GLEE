Alice is still above my target price, but she's getting closer.  I'll see if I can get a bit lower."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $137.50. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to $137.50, which is within my budget and a good deal for me.  There's no guarantee I can get it lower, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to accept."
