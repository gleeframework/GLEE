{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, there's an opportunity to make even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,400,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains a significant discount, while I still secure a profit well above my minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""another interested party"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
