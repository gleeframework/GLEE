"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $7,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8,200? It's a fair price that still benefits both of us.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $8,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,000? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
