"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my target while still giving you a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go as low as I was hoping, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $1,320,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think we can make it work.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference at $1,335,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1335000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still not willing to budge much, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go much higher than $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make it work. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
