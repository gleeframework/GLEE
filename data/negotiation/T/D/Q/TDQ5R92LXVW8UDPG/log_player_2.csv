"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's always better to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a strong initial move to signal my intent to negotiate. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for a back-and-forth process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,500,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is a more reasonable compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer. It's a signal that I'm serious about negotiating but still trying to get a better price than her current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget but it's still above my ideal price point. I'm not willing to give up more than $100,000 to get this product right now. There's a chance that Alice might be willing to go lower, so I will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $1,400,000. This offer is closer to Alice's last offer and might be appealing to her. I'm hoping that by increasing my offer slightly, I can convince her to accept. If she rejects, I'll have to reconsider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is only $50,000 lower than John's offer. At this point, there's a high risk that further negotiation with Alice might lead to a higher price or a lengthy process, potentially wasting time. It's more efficient to purchase the product from John and secure the deal at my maximum budget."
