Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe it has value, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to accept such a large loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is significantly lower than what I need to sell it for.  I'm willing to come down to $160. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $140 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $155, which is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's try to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $145 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not confident that further negotiation will result in a higher offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150. This will guarantee me my minimum desired profit."
