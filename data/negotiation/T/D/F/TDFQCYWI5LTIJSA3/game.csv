"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and what I've invested in it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
