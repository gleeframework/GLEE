"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, so it's worth seeing if she'll negotiate before resorting to John's higher price."
