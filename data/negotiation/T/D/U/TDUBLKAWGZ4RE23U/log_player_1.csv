"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he's genuinely interested, he'll likely make a counteroffer.
* **Set the tone:**  A high starting offer establishes my initial position and gives me room to negotiate downwards.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind my backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. 

* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Gaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I show I'm not desperate and can potentially push for a higher price.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This is still a considerable amount above Bob's offer of $950,000, but it shows a willingness to compromise.

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer signals that I'm ready to meet halfway, but I'm still confident in the value of the product.
* **Keeping Leverage:**  By offering a price higher than Bob's last offer, I keep the negotiation dynamic in my favor and maintain the pressure.

This counteroffer should be attractive enough to encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price, but not so low that I lose out on a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't at least match my backup offer from John.

* **Time is on my side:** We are only in Round 4, and I have more negotiation rounds to work with.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and I'm prepared to walk away if needed.

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob and aim for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, showing a clear intention to compromise. However, it's still above Bob's last offer of $920,000, and importantly, it's higher than my backup offer from John.

* **Closing the Gap:** This offer further narrows the gap between our positions and shows my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining Value:**  By offering a price above John's offer, I ensure I'm still getting a decent return on the product.

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and encouraging Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm still hoping to get a better price than John's offer, we're reaching a critical point in the negotiation.

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in Round 6, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a better outcome.
* **Minimal Gains:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is only $100,000 more than my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiations might take longer and yield minimal gains.

Given these factors, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and guarantee a sale for $1,000,000. This ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob."
