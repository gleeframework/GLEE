Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The price is lower than the product's value to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate and increasing the chance of a successful deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is direct and avoids any ambiguity, setting a professional tone for the negotiation. 

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's worth exploring if you can reach a better price with Bob before settling for the lower price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would still allow you to gain significant value from the product, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this sale. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay above your minimum:** $850,000 is still higher than your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you don't lose out.
* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate but also have a clear bottom line.
* **Highlight the value for Bob:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will get even at this price, making it more appealing.

This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects it, but it puts you in a stronger position than accepting his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below the $800,000 you can get from John.  Since you're focused on maximizing your profit, selling to John is the most logical choice in this situation."
