"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's below the market value and allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $8,750, which is a fair compromise.  This price gives you a good profit while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal!",8750.0,Bob,4,
