"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly less than the $1,500,000 you're willing to pay, and also much better than the $1,500,000 John is asking.  It's a good deal for you, saving you $300,000. There's no reason to risk getting a worse deal in the next round or paying John more."
