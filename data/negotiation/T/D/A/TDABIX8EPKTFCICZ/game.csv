"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Based on our discussions, I understand it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, which is a significant discount from what it's worth to you. This offer is valid for a limited time, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,1,
