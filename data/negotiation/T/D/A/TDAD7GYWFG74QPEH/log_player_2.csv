"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially exceeding $1000000. I understand that you may not be aware of its full potential, so I'm willing to offer it to you at a price point that reflects this uncertainty. My offer is $1200000.  If you're interested, let's discuss further. If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe you could maximize its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is lower than Alice's offer.
