Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price given the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the $900,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,050,000? I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
