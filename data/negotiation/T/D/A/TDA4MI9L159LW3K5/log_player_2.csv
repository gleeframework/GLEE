# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the $900,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential for you.
