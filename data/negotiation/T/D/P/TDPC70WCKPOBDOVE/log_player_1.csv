Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe is worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving you room to negotiate. It also sets a positive tone by expressing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a little more than that to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a good price for both of us, and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I believe I can get him to agree to $1,000,000 in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to move forward with the transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
