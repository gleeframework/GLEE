"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a much lower price than $12,000, considering your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's minimum acceptable price is $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good starting point for negotiation.  
* **Target Range:**  We know Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000, and you're willing to pay up to $15,000. This gives us a range to work with.
* **Counteroffer:**  A counteroffer of $9,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's also a reasonable price considering your budget and Alice's minimum. 
* **Next Steps:**  This counteroffer will likely trigger further negotiation. Alice may accept, counter with a higher price, or reject outright.  You'll have to assess each response and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice has lowered her price to $10,500, which is closer to your desired range.
* **Potential Savings:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice won't budge much lower. You're already saving $4,500 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again, leading to a potential stalemate or needing to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting the offer at $10,500 secures the product at a good price with minimal risk."
