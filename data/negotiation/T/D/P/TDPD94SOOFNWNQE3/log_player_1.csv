I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum price since the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and hopefully, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
