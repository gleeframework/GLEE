Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105?

I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $115.  Would you consider $110? It's a fair price for a product that you value so highly."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your original price, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to $115,  $107.50 is a decent price and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob entirely.  I'll accept his offer."
