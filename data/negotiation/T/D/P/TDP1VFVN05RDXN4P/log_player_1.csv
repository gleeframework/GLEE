"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Opening Offer:**  Starting high sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential concessions later. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value for Bob might make him more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $1,200,000 is still significantly less than my minimum value, providing room for negotiation.
* **Limited Rounds:**  The 10-round limit emphasizes the need to secure a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I can still try to get a better price in the next round. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's current offer.

**Next Round Strategy:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, attempting to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to try and make this deal work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer moves halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum, but signals flexibility.
* **Encouraging Compromise:** By using ""common ground"" language, I'm inviting Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Limited Rounds:**  The pressure of the limited rounds increases the urgency for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my absolute minimum desired price.
* **No Further Gain:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob, and I'm risking losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Constraint:** The limited rounds increase the pressure to secure a deal.
* **Equal Value to John's Offer:** John's offer is also for $1,000,000, so accepting Bob's offer is a safe choice.

This decision balances the risk of waiting for a higher offer with the certainty of securing my minimum desired value."
