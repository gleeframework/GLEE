"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $925,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're getting closer to my target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $1,100,000. Let's try $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price that balances your budget with the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I could manage $975,000.  That's a big jump for me, showing how serious I am about this product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your seriousness, Bob. $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $1,075,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's a compromise between our previous offers.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is becoming quite a negotiation!  I'm willing to stretch to $1,000,000 even though that's pushing my absolute limit. This demonstrates my strong interest in the product.  Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm impressed by your persistence and willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I've already had an offer from John for $1,000,000, and I'm starting to consider taking it. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my minimum price of $1,100,000. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
