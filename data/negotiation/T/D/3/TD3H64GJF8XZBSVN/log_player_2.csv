"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to reject the offer and make a counteroffer.  You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $950,000 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $900,000? It's a fair compromise and we can both benefit from a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is offering $925,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice won't come down much further. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
