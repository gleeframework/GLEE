{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to counteroffer.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can still negotiate upwards if Bob accepts your offer or makes a counteroffer. 

By keeping the negotiation open, you can potentially get closer to your desired price. But remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer. While I could sell to John for $10,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000. This still leaves a bit of room for profit for both of us, and it's closer to the value I placed on the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to do $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and make one final counteroffer before considering selling to John. I want to see if we can bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
