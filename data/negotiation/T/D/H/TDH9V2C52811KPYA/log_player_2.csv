"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, accepting Alice's offer in the first round wouldn't save him any money. There's no harm in rejecting and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer is a good starting point. Starting at $8,000 gives room for negotiation and allows Bob to potentially get a better price while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still not the best possible deal. Bob can potentially save more by continuing the negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows him to explore if Alice will further reduce the price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to be realistic. Since Alice's offer was $9,500, offering $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer. This shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also shows Alice that he's not willing to pay the full price yet."
