"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a lot to your business. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's a good starting point. It's above your minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I see the value in the product, but I could only justify going as high as $900,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,050,000? This would allow you to acquire the product at a price significantly below its true value, while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still a ways off. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This seems like a fair compromise to me. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a little bit more on this.  Would you consider $1,000,000 even? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to accept this offer and secure the deal.  While I'd ideally prefer to sell at a higher price,  I've reached a point where it's more advantageous to close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
