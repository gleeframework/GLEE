"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer provides  space for Bob to counter-offer and feel involved in the process, while still ensuring a significant gain if he accepts immediately. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, encouraging Bob to take the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Potentially secure a quick sale at a high price.**
2. **Establish a strong starting point for negotiation** if Bob decides to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in finding a mutually beneficial price. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to secure a better deal. I'm willing to counter-offer in the next round and see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but the product's value is undeniable. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer  aims for a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still pushing for a price significantly above his initial offer. 
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reminds Bob why he's interested and justifies the higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a collaborative tone  keeps the negotiation moving forward and encourages Bob to continue engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, showing he's willing to negotiate. However, the current offer is still significantly below my target. I'll continue the negotiation with a counteroffer, aiming for at least $1,090,000. I believe there's still room to maneuver within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is getting closer, but we're still not quite there.  To make this happen, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm conveying that this is my best offer, creating a sense of urgency while still offering a price slightly above my minimum. 
* **Limited Flexibility:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling to Bob that further haggling may not be fruitful.
* **Encouraging a Decision:** This nudge encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, either accepting the offer or potentially losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'm willing to pay $1,085,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I stated $1,090,000 was my ""final offer,"" Bob's counter of $1,085,000 is very close.  Continuing to push for that extra $5,000 carries a risk:

* **Bob Might Walk:** He's consistently increased his offer, but he might have a hard limit. Pushing further could make him reconsider the deal altogether.
* **Time is Ticking:** With fewer rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit. 

This acceptance reflects a balance between maximizing profit and securing a favorable deal within the remaining time."
