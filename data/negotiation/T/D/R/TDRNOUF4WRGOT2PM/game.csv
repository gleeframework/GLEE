"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I think that's a fair offer.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200. This is still a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
