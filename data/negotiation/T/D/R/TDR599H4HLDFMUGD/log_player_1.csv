Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  The minimum you'll accept is $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**Strategy**

Since Bob values the product at less than your guaranteed sale price, you have leverage. However, you want to maximize your profit. Here's the strategy:

1. **Start High:** Aim slightly above your guaranteed price to leave room for negotiation.
2. **Justify Your Price:**  Provide a reason for the high price (e.g., market demand, unique features).
3. **Leave Room for Bob:**  Frame your offer in a way that allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition and high demand, I'm initially setting the price at $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to explore options."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,600,000 gives you room to negotiate while staying above your guaranteed price.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""high demand"" creates a perception of value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" signals your willingness to negotiate.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, you might consider a lower price, but still above $1,500,000.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might be more flexible.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and your own priorities."
