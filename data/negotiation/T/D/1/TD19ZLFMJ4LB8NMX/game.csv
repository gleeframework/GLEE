"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I believe we can reach a fair compromise. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $11,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the product I need.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  How about $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
