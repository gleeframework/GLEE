"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is under your $120 limit, you can try to get a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, and you can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
