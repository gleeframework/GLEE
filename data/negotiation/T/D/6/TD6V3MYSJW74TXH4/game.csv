"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
