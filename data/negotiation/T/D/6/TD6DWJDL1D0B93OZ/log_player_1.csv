"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This is a high starting offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a substantial profit. I believe that by starting high, I can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, giving me more information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident that a price in the middle ground will be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my ideal price. I'm confident that I can't get much more from him, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
