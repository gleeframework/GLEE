Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation, letting Bob know I'm willing to work with him. 
* **Strategic Backup:** Having John as a potential buyer gives me a safety net and the ability to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8,000 on this product. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, his willingness to negotiate shows there's still room for compromise. I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000, which gives me leverage to refuse Bob's low offer and push for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a good price for both of us, and I believe this product will be a great asset to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob's business, hoping to create a stronger sense of its worth.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing me some leeway in case Bob makes another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering our conversation, I am still interested in purchasing the product but would like to stick to my budget of $8,000. Could you possibly meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000. This offer provides me with a significantly better financial outcome compared to accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob has repeatedly shown a strong resistance to going above his initial budget. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.

**Conclusion:** While I appreciate Bob's interest, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John at $10,000.  This ensures I achieve my minimum price and maximize my profit."
