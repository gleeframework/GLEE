"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a good price for both of us, and I believe this product will be a great asset to your business. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
