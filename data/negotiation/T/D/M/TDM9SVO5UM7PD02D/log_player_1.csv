Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $100, I want to start with a price higher than that to see if I can get a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum price if he accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $100. This gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
