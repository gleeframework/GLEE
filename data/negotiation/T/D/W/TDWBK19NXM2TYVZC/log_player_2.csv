"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find the product valuable and worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $18,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still far above Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for the agreed-upon price of $8,000.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a better price, but it's a risk, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down to Bob's budget.  It's best to secure the product for the known price from John."
