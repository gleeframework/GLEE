I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than his estimated value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves me with a profit of $1,000 if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves me with a profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's counteroffer of $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not willing to go lower, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
