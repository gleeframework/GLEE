"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging your concerns about the price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
