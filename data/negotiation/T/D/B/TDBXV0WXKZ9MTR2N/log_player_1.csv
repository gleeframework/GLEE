Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see the immense value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation if needed.
* **Understanding Value:** We know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,000,000) than our minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Profit:** Offering it at $925,000 still allows Bob a significant profit margin, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Confidence:** The message is framed confidently and emphasizes the product's value, increasing the perceived worth.

This approach aims to secure a price significantly higher than our fallback option (John) while still making it appealing enough for Bob to accept."
