"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see the immense value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to purchase from John, even though it's at the maximum price, ensuring you secure the product within your budget."
