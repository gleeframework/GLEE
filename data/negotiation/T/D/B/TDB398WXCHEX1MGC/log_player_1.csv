Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $120, we can gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, we exceed our minimum. If he negotiates, we can then decide whether to lower the price or move on to John.
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives us leverage. We are not desperate to sell below our minimum price."
