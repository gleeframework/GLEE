Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This offer is time-sensitive and won't be available for long."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $50,000 discount compared to its value to him, and I earn a significant profit above his perceived value.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the offer's limited time frame to encourage a quick decision from Bob.

This approach aims to capitalize on the potential for a higher sale price before resorting to the guaranteed option with John."
