Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. I think $100 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $120.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $110 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'll make one more counteroffer in the next round before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $110 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $115. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $110 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've reached my limit with counteroffers, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale to John. I'll sell the product to John for $150."
