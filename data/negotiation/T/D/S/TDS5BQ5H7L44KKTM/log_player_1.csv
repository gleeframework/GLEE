"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to test Bob's willingness to pay while leaving room for a counteroffer without immediately triggering his ""walk away"" threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to explore further options and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to consider a price closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? This would still provide you with a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $10500, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly higher than my fallback price with John and is also a good compromise in the middle of our current negotiations.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds where I might not reach a better outcome."
