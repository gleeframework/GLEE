"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $10500.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and counteroffer at $11250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
