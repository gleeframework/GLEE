"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While $11,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and counteroffer at $11250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is very close to his target price, but Alice is still holding firm at $11,250. It's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to bring the price down further.  To avoid further delay and ensure he gets the product, Bob should choose option (3) and buy the product from John for $10,000.  This is the best option for Bob, as it guarantees him the product at his maximum price point."
