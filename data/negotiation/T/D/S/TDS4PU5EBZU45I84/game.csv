"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's actual value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the uniqueness and potential of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart in our valuations.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
