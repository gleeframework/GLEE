Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you.
