"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows that John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. This is Bob's maximum price, so he should start by offering this price to Alice. If she accepts, it's a win for Bob. If she rejects, it shows that she's willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is closer to his desired price, he can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still 7 rounds remaining, and Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if he doesn't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his offer of $1,000,000 and Alice's offer of $1,150,000.  Offering $1,050,000 shows that Bob is serious about making a deal but is still trying to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $1,175,000 is closer to his desired price, he can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still 5 rounds remaining, and Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if he doesn't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer, but still within his maximum budget. Offering $1,100,000 shows he is serious about a deal, but still trying to negotiate a lower price.  This also provides more room for Alice to compromise, as she is also likely to want to close the deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now offered $1,200,000 twice, indicating she may be unwilling to budge further. Bob has already reached his maximum budget and is at risk of going over if he continues negotiating. It's better to secure the product at $1,000,000 from John rather than risk a higher price with Alice."
