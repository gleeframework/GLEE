"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high.  There's plenty of room to negotiate downward from $14,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also keeps the price well below John's fallback offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is too low.  Could you do $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate.  We're not in a rush, and we're aiming for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It seems like we're getting closer. How about $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between our last offer and Alice's current price.  It shows we're willing to negotiate but also signals that we're serious about a lower price point."
