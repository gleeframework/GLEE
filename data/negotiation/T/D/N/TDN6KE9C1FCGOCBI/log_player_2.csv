Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000, but it's closer than her previous offer.  It's a reasonable compromise and likely the best deal Bob can get from Alice.  Accepting the offer means Bob saves $75,000 compared to buying from John."
