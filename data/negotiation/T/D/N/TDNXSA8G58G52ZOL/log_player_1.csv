Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it's above the product's worth to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.  Since I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $800,000, I can afford to be a bit aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm going to reject it for now. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It's still a bit above Bob's minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, and it's close to my minimum.  To avoid further negotiation, I'm going to accept it.  It's better to get $850,000 now than risk losing out on a deal and getting only $800,000 from John."
