Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer allows for a good profit margin for me ($140 - $150 cost = -$10 loss, but better than nothing), while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider, as he'd still get a $40 value out of the deal. This strategy maximizes my chances of selling to Bob while minimizing my potential loss if he rejects the offer."
