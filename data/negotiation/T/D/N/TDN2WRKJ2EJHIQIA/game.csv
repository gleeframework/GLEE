"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's close this deal!",875000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and offer to cover shipping.  However, $825,000 still falls short of the true value of this unique product. Let's split the difference.

"Bob, I appreciate your ongoing interest and willingness to compromise. While $812,500 is a respectable offer, it still doesn't fully reflect the exceptional value and unique benefits this product offers.  For a final, mutually beneficial agreement, I'm prepared to accept $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive, and allows for a swift and smooth transaction.
