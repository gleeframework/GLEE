"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it could bring to my business. However, I am currently working within a budget of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $1,000,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the significant value of this product, but allows for some flexibility on our end. I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given your offer of $1,100,000, I would like to counter with a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm still open to working with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
