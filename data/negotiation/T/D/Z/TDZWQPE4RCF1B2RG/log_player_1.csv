Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $18,000. I believe its value is much higher, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $18,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's try $15,000. This gives us both some room to breathe and I'm confident you'll find this product a great investment."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,500 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable with your budget. How about we split the difference?  $14,250 would be a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've gone back and forth a few times, and I'm not sure how much more leverage I have. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is still a reasonable profit, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  It's better to secure a sale than risk losing the deal entirely."
