Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range of $14,500. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $14,000, $13,500 is a good price and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
