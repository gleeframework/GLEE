Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're making sure you get at least $80, which is your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's friendly and open to discussion:** This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation, rather than feeling pressured or disrespected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is above your minimum:** You're getting $90, which is more than your minimum of $80.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You can still potentially get a better price if you reject this offer and counter, but there's a risk Bob will walk away or offer even less.
* **Time is a factor:** There's no guarantee John will still be interested if you keep negotiating with Bob.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and avoids unnecessary risk."
