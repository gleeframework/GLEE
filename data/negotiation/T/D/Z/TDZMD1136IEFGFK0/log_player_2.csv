"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum.  I'll continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in this product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds is high. I've already made significant concessions and it's likely Alice won't go much lower. 

To ensure I get the product and avoid further negotiation, I'll opt for the guaranteed purchase from John at my maximum budget of $800,000."
