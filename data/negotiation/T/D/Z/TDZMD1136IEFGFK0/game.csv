"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in this product.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
