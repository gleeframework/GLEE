Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $765,000

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's becoming clear he's very focused on staying below $800,000. At this point, continuing the negotiation has a higher risk than reward.  John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 is a safe bet and ensures Alice doesn't lose potential profit by continuing a risky negotiation."
