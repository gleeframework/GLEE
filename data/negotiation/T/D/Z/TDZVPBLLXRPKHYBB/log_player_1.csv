Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential counteroffer and sets the stage for a back-and-forth.  I'm also being friendly and positive to create a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I'm getting closer to my desired price. I'm also highlighting the benefits for Bob, emphasizing that it's still a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low yet.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  How about $10,000?  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm proposing $10,000, which is still above Bob's offer but a bit lower than my previous counteroffer. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. This should encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously."
