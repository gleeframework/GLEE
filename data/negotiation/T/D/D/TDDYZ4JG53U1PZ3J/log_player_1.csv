Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value and potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $800,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further risk of negotiation."
