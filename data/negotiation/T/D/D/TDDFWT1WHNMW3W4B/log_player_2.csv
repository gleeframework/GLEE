"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1300000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have the potential to negotiate a better deal with Alice, or you can always fall back on John's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within the realm of reason. It shows that you're serious about purchasing the product but also trying to get a fair price. This should open a negotiation window with Alice, allowing you to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is exactly your maximum price. This is a perfect scenario - you're getting the product at your desired price without needing to negotiate further. It's also a win for Alice as she gets a decent price for her product. Accepting this offer saves time and ensures a successful transaction."
