* Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is only $25,000 higher than your last counteroffer.
* Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it's unlikely you'll get significantly closer to your initial target of $1,000,000.
* You're already saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John ($1,500,000).
* Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing or taking too long."
