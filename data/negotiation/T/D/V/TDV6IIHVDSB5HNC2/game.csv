"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This would give you a good return, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'd like to get a 5% deposit upfront, with the remaining balance due in 30 days. This will give me some assurance that the deal will go through. My counteroffer is $1100000 with a 5% deposit requirement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
