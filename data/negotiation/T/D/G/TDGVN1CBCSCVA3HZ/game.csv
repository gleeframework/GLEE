"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a higher offer.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This price is still fair considering the value you'll receive.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference between our previous offers? I'd be willing to go up to $925,000.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher offer. I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product.  This is a final compromise from my side, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll gain.",975000.0,Alice,5,
