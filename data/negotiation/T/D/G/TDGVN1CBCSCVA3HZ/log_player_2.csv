Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a higher offer.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This price is still fair considering the value you'll receive.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher offer. I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product.  This is a final compromise from my side, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll gain.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:** We are already on round 5 out of 10. While we could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the point where we risk running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John for $1,000,000.

* **Favorable Price:** Alice's offer of $975,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and only $25,000 more than John's price. 

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final compromise, making further negotiation unlikely to yield a substantially better outcome.

It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now rather than risk losing the opportunity for a marginal saving."
