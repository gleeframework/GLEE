"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1200000? I'm sure we can find a fair solution.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I've received a competing offer from another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay the minimum of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $1300000? I'm open to discussing this further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already received a solid offer from John for $1200000, and I'm starting to lean towards accepting it. I'm willing to make one more concession to you, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budgetary constraints. I've done some research and found that the market value for this product might not justify such a high price. I would like to propose a final offer of $1250000. This is my best offer based on my current financial situation. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your thorough research and understanding of the market value. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's minimum value, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1275000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1275000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting very close to the product's minimum value, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I can offer the product to you for $1200000. This is my absolute final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
