Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down slightly.
* **Time Value:**  While we have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even at a slightly lower price. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more, while still maintaining a strong profit margin."
