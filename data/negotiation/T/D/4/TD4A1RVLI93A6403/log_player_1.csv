{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows you are open to making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the product's worth to me and even less than John's offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,000 is a good offer, it's a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $8000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $7800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is getting too low.  He's not showing much willingness to meet me halfway, and I don't want to waste more time.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's much closer to what I want."
