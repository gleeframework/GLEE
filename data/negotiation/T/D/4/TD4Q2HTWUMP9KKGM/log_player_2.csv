"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high, hoping you'll accept. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, and she might be willing to lower the price to avoid losing the sale."
