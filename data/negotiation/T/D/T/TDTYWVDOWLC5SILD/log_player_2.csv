"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer for now. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being manageable for me."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000, which would be $825,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's clear she's not going to reach my $800,000 limit. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees I stay within my budget."
