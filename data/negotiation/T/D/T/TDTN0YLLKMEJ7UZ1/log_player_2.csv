# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially save more money than buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,250,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John.  It's a good compromise."
