Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
