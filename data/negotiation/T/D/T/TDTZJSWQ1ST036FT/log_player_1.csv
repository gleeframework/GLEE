Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I have several rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for less than $100 yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  We are now in round 6, and Bob's offers are getting too low. I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a low price if he continues to refuse to negotiate.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal."
