"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
