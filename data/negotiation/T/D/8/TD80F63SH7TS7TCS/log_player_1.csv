"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I need to try and get a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point in future rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to what I want, it's still not enough, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm also still early in the negotiation process, and I have plenty of rounds left.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still not a number I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable to me, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While we're getting closer, $975,000 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point with a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'm also concerned that if I accept this offer, I'll be leaving a lot of money on the table.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference?  $1,012,500.  That's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product to you while still giving me a reasonable return.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $987,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but it's becoming clear that he's unwilling to pay what the product is worth to me. I've already rejected several of his offers, and I'm running out of time.  With John, I have a guaranteed deal at a price I'm happy with.  I'm not going to risk losing that opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
