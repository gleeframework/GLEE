"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my limits.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still not a number I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference?  $1,012,500.  That's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product to you while still giving me a reasonable return.  Let's close this deal.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
