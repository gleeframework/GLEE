Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net, ensuring Alice doesn't lose money.
* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and implies there's competition (""before I list it publicly""). This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept."
