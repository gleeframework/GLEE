"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has 9 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start by making a significant counteroffer, but one that is still within the realm of reason.  Offering $12,500 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount. This approach leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Although it's closer to Bob's preferred price, he should continue to try to negotiate. He has 7 rounds left, and there is still room for Alice to lower her price further.  Buying from John at this point would not be the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he still needs to save money.  He should increase his counteroffer slightly to $12,750. This shows Alice he is willing to negotiate but is still determined to get a better price.  It also allows for some room for Alice to counter with a lower price before he considers buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob has time to continue negotiating. He should continue to counteroffer to try and secure a lower price, especially since buying from John is always an option if he doesn't get the desired price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still needs to save money.  He should increase his counteroffer slightly to $12,900. This shows Alice he is willing to negotiate but is still determined to get a better price.  It also allows for some room for Alice to counter with a lower price before he considers buying from John. There are only 4 rounds left, so he needs to be strategic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his limit. Bob has only 3 rounds left, so he needs to be strategic.  It's still possible to secure a lower price with some more negotiation. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down to $12,000, but there's also no need to rush into buying from John right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and needs to make a final push. By offering $13,000, Bob is showing Alice he's serious about closing the deal, but still trying to stay under his maximum budget. He is only 2 rounds away from needing to make a decision, so he needs to be closer to a final price. This offer leaves room for a small counteroffer from Alice, but if she rejects, Bob can consider buying from John or accepting the deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, as Alice's offer is very close to Bob's maximum budget. However, Bob has only one round left and needs to make a decision.  While there's a chance Alice might accept a counteroffer, there's also a risk that she will reject it and Bob will be left with no deal. 

It's better to be safe than sorry. Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget. He is only sacrificing $1,400, which is a reasonable compromise considering the risk involved in continuing the negotiation."
