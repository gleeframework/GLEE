"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's a fair price that is within the range of what Bob is willing to pay and what I'm willing to accept. I hope to close the deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $130 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything less than $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise that is still within my range of what I'm willing to accept, but it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hopeful that he'll accept this price."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $132 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm confident we can close the deal in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 134}
```

I'm countering with $134. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm still willing to come down a bit. I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to the price I'm willing to accept, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to sell to John just yet.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 133}
```

I'm countering with $133.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping that it will be enough to convince him to accept. We're getting close to a deal, and I want to avoid selling to John at a lower price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough and we're running out of rounds.  I'd rather sell to Bob at this price than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
