"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's clear there's room for negotiation. You should reject this offer and present a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $13,500 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a good deal.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind you have the option to buy from John for $8,000. This should influence your negotiation strategy, preventing you from getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly lower than its true value. This product offers unique features and benefits that justify a higher price.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $11,000 is still considerably more than both your target price and what John is offering.  You need to signal that you're serious about a lower price point without being unreasonable. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle during the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm definitely interested in finding a price that works for both of us. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:**  You're increasing your offer, but staying well below her last offer and still under your $8,000 maximum.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims for a price point roughly in the middle of the two previous offers, encouraging Alice to meet you closer to your range.
* **Time Consideration:** You're getting closer to your walk-away price, but there are still rounds left to potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, finding a fair compromise is important. While $7,500 is closer to what you had in mind, it's still below the value I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This feels like a good balance considering the product's benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $9,500 is still above your budget and your fallback option with John.  While she's suggesting ""meeting in the middle,"" her idea of the middle is still skewed towards her starting price. It's time to push a bit harder towards your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm definitely still interested. However, I need to stay within my budget. My absolute maximum is $8,000 for this.  Would you be willing to work with that?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're holding your ground at your maximum budget while acknowledging her position. This shows you're serious but not trying to lowball her.
* **Final Offer (Almost):**  By stating your ""absolute maximum,"" you're signaling this is likely your best offer, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Weighing Options:**  You're now at your fallback price with John.  Alice has to decide if losing the sale entirely is worth holding out for a potentially slightly higher offer."
