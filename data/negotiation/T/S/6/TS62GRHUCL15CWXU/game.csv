"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $13,500 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly lower than its true value. This product offers unique features and benefits that justify a higher price.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm definitely interested in finding a price that works for both of us. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, finding a fair compromise is important. While $7,500 is closer to what you had in mind, it's still below the value I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This feels like a good balance considering the product's benefits.",9500.0,Alice,5,
