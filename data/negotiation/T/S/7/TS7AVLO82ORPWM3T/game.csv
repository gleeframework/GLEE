"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is quite low for the value this product offers. Would you consider $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
