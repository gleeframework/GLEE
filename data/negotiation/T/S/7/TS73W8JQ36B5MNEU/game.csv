"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in the product. Let's make this deal!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we meet at $11750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
