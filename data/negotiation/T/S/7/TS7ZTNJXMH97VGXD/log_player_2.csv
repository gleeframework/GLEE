Alice is coming down, but very slowly.  We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate and I'm willing to see if she'll move closer to $100."

Alice is getting very close to my ideal price range. However, her language suggests she might be willing to go a little lower. I'll push my luck one more round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I can do $107, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that, but I want to make a sale.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point.  While I could try to push her further, it's getting risky.  $107 is a reasonable price and a good compromise."
