"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a significant profit while still ensuring I receive a good return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,350,000**.  This is still within Bob's budget of $1,500,000.
* **The price is getting closer to Bob's ideal.**  The original offer was $1,400,000, and Alice has moved down to $1,350,000.
* **Continuing negotiation is risky.** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and Bob risks losing the deal entirely if Alice gets frustrated.

By accepting the offer, Bob saves $50,000 compared to John's price and secures the product."
