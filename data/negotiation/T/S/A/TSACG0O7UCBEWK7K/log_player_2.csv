"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. It's a rare find, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer is the best decision. It allows you to purchase the product for $1,200,000, which is significantly less than the $1,500,000 you would pay John.  Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice,  you still save $300,000 by buying from her."
