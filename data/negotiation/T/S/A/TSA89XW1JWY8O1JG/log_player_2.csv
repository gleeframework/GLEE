"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price or go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is $10,000. This is the price I can get from John, so it's a good starting point for negotiation. If Alice rejects, I can either accept John's offer or try to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's still a chance Alice will come down further. If not, I can always go with John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still sticking to a price that's within my budget.  If Alice rejects this, I'm prepared to go with John's offer, as it's likely we won't get much closer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While we've made some progress in negotiations,  I'm not confident that we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with. It's more efficient to just go with John's offer of $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
