"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still higher than my ideal goal of saving as much as possible. There's no indication of the product's value to Alice, so I'm likely in a good position to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to do $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. A $20 drop is a considerable reduction and could potentially lead to a successful deal in the early rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, showing she's willing to negotiate. $110 is still within my budget and represents a good compromise. While I could try to get a lower price, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John at a higher price."
