"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $1075000. This is my final offer, I'm afraid. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Alice, but $1075000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'm willing to go up to $975000. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $975000, Bob, but I'm afraid that's still not enough for me to consider it a fair deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm thinking of a price of $1080000. This is my final offer, I'm afraid. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but $1080000 is still too high for me. I've already gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. I'm offering $980000. This is my final offer.",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we've been back and forth for a while, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm thinking of a price of $1090000. This is my final offer, I'm afraid.
