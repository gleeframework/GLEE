You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $750,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $725,000, which is still better than John's price of $800,000.  There's a risk that further negotiation might result in a better price, but there's also a chance of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially even increasing the price.  At this point, accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a lower price than John's offer."
