Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation drags on or becomes unproductive, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but  $600,000 is closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is simply too low to consider at this point.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $900,000?  That gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a compromise. It's a substantial increase from Bob's offer of $600,000, but still less than my initial offer of $1,200,000. It aims to strike a balance and find a price that both parties might be willing to accept.
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's budget concerns while reaffirming the product's value. It frames the counteroffer as a fair and reasonable solution.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I've secured a decent price for the product.
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to carefully analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation continues to stall or Bob's offers remain too low, I'll likely sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $700,000 is still far too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $700,000 is still significantly below what I can accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still offers you a great deal and ensures I can make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell for a price that drastically undervalues the product. 
* **Message:** The message conveys my willingness to compromise while emphasizing that $850,000 remains a reasonable price for both parties. It aims to push Bob towards a final decision.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price, though not ideal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000.  Further negotiation with Bob at this point may not be fruitful."
