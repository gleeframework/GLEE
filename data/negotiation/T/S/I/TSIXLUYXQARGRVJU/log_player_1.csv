Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Strong Starting Point:** $10,000 is a strong starting point, aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you subtly remind Bob that you have other options if he rejects your offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he wishes."
