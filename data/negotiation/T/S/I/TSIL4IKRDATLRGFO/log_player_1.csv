{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This leaves room for negotiation, but is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $165. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, Bob will find this price acceptable and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $165, Bob's offer of $155 is still better than selling to John for $150. It's a reasonable compromise and I'm happy to accept it."
