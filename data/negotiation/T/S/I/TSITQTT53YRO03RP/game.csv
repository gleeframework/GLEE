"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me is around $800000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $800000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm offering you the product for $850000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $850000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825000 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
