"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's not, we can start negotiating from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving some room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,600,000.  While I was hoping for a bit more, it's a good price, and I'm not sure I can get much higher with the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure a decent profit than to risk getting nothing."
