"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,900,000 represents the high end of its value, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  I believe this accounts for the value it offers while still being a worthwhile investment for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
