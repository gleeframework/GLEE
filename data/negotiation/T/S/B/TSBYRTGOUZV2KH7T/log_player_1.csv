Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a reasonable starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially make a profit. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **I'm keeping my options open by reminding Bob that I could sell to John for $15,000.** This subtly adds pressure to Bob to make a deal.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential profit and encouraging Bob to accept an offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $10,000 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  
* **Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit.** However, I'm not willing to give up on Bob just yet. 

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John is the safest option, I'm going to take a calculated risk. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating. There's a chance I can push Bob closer to my desired price, potentially earning more than $15,000. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll carefully craft a counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to find a price that's attractive to him while still maximizing my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While $10,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to negotiate.** This builds a positive rapport and shows I'm open to compromise.
* **I'm suggesting a middle ground at $11,500.** This price is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping my profit margin above my minimum.
* **I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us.** Emphasizing a ""fair profit"" for me and a ""great deal"" for Bob makes the offer more appealing.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while demonstrating my seriousness about closing a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic about Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I believe $10,000 is a fair price considering the current market conditions and the value of the product. However, if you're unwilling to meet at that price, I'll consider purchasing the product from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** He's essentially calling my bluff by threatening to buy from John.
* **The risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.** There's no guarantee I can convince Bob to pay more, and I risk losing both Bob and John as buyers.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to maximize my profits, the current situation presents a significant risk.  By selling to John, I ensure a guaranteed profit of $15,000. This is a better outcome than potentially ending up with nothing.

**Next Steps:**

I'll move forward with selling to John. While I'm disappointed I couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I'm content with securing a reasonable profit for my product."
