"Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While $10,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I believe $10,000 is a fair price considering the current market conditions and the value of the product. However, if you're unwilling to meet at that price, I'll consider purchasing the product from John instead.",10000.0,Bob,4,
