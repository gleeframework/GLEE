"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately. You have 10 rounds and the ability to counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to sell for less, and you can always fall back on buying from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows you to explore negotiation possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $750,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for potential concessions. It's a bold opening move that could either lead to a quick deal if Alice is eager to sell, or prompt further negotiation. This also gives you a good baseline for the rest of the rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still closer to John's price than to my ideal price.  I'm not in a rush and have more rounds to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's still room to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price range.  Counteroffering with $800,000 shows a willingness to meet her halfway.  This is a balanced approach that acknowledges her concessions while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
