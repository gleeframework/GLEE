"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a million dollars. This is a strong opening offer that demonstrates the value I place on the product. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, it sets the stage for a negotiation where I can hopefully land a price closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating. I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob, especially since he's already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum price. It shows that I'm willing to compromise, while maintaining a position that's more favorable than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation, as I might risk him backing out and potentially getting nothing. Accepting this offer ensures I secure my minimum desired value."
