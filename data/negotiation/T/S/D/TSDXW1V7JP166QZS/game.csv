"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $85?  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle on $87.50?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and it lets me get the product without breaking the bank.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $87.50. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $91.25. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",91.25,Alice,5,
