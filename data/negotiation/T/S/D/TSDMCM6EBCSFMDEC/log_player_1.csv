I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm countering with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we both find agreeable."

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to get Bob to agree.  This price is still above my minimum value, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our previous negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum value, it's better than selling to John, and the negotiation process has been quite lengthy.  I'm willing to close the deal at this point to avoid further delays."
