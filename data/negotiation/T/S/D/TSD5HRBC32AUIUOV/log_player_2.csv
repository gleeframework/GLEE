"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $14,000.  Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13,000?  That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for Bob. While he could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice getting firm and sticking to her offer or Bob losing the opportunity to John is high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's offer and also saves him the time and effort of further negotiation."
