"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $12,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" and the fact that it's below his estimated value will make the offer more attractive.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us, considering your estimated value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price:** $10,000 is still below my minimum, even though it's closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While $8,000 is my absolute minimum, I believe I can do better with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely around $11,000. I will try to find a middle ground while still exceeding my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000?  It's a fair price that still allows me to cover my costs, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** $11,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **Appealing to Compromise:** The message emphasizes the desire to find a fair compromise, making me appear more flexible.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and optimistic, encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
