Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,750. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $7,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope you can understand that it's still a good value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $7,200 is a better price, we're still in a negotiation.  Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to deal. We have room to push a bit further down towards our ideal price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but $7,200 is still a little high.  Would you consider $6,800?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 6800
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's last offer ($7,200) and our previous counteroffer ($6,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our goal.
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating we are getting ""closer to [our] budget limit,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency without revealing our absolute bottom line.
* **Positive language:**  We maintain a positive and appreciative tone to encourage a collaborative negotiation."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $7,000. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer the product to you for $7,100. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope you can understand that it's still a good value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is clearly sticking close to her $7,000 floor.  Further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the 10-round limit.  Continuing to negotiate increases the risk of Alice walking away, leaving us with John's $8,000 offer.
* **Acceptable Savings:**  $7,100 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $900 compared to John's price. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
