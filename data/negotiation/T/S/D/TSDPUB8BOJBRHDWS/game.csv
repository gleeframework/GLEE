"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,750. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",7750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While $7,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider coming down a little further, say to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $7,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope you can understand that it's still a good value for the product.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but $7,200 is still a little high.  Would you consider $6,800?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",6800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $7,000. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer the product to you for $7,100. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope you can understand that it's still a good value for the product.",7100.0,Alice,7,
