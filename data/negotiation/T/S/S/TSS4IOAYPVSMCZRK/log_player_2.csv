Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, I believe."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  $750,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference at $850,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow both of us to walk away with a win.  I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000.  You can secure the product at your target price from John without further negotiation."
