"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum desired value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards and still achieve a profitable sale.
* **Confidence in value:**  Highlighting the value of the product can incentivize Bob to consider the offer, even if it's initially above his perceived worth. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate, leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Important note:** This is just the first offer. The strategy for future rounds will depend on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation. I'll be ready to adjust my offers based on his counteroffers and the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.** Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **There are still 8 rounds remaining.** This allows for more negotiation and potential for a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John guarantees a profit.** However, I'm not willing to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob just yet. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to round 3 and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value. I'll try to find a middle ground, but I will be firm on my minimum requirement of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price point above my minimum requirement. 
* **Highlighting the value again:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth to justify the price. 
* **Seeking common ground:** This message focuses on finding a mutually acceptable solution, encouraging Bob to engage further in the negotiation. 

**Important Notes:**

* I'm keeping an eye on the number of rounds remaining and will adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* My next move will depend on Bob's response.  If he's unwilling to budge, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.**  While it's closer than before, accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **We are nearing the midpoint of the negotiation.** I want to see if I can push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John. 
* **I have a solid backup option.**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in Round 5. I'll likely propose a price closer to $850,000, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. If he continues to be unwilling to meet my minimum requirement, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  $750,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference at $850,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow both of us to walk away with a win.  I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000).  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm mentioning the value of the product again to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a ""win"" for both parties, making the offer more appealing.

**Important Notes:**

* This is getting closer to my minimum requirement. 
* I'm still mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John.  If Bob doesn't agree to a price close to my minimum, I'll have to make a decision in the next few rounds."
