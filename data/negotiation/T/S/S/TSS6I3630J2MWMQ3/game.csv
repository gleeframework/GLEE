"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000. Let me know if that's acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
