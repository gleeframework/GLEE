"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** If the negotiation fails, you can still purchase the product, but at a higher price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 represents a fair valuation considering the product's potential, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within budget:**  $1,350,000 is below your maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile:**  It's possible to negotiate further, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher price from John. 
* **Accepting secures the product:**  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with, saving the risk and time involved in further negotiation."
