"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but to be honest, $850,000 is a significant deviation from what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I must respectfully decline at $975,000. I would like to propose a price closer to my budget, which is around $850,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what we can agree upon.",850000.0,Bob,4,
