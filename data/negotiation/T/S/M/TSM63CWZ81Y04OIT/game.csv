"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to my asking price to consider this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
