{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still earns us a significant profit above our minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he counters.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not explicitly mentioning John, we create a subtle sense of urgency. Bob might feel compelled to act quickly if he's interested."
