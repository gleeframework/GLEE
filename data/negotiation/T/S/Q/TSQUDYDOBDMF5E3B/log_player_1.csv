Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you start with a price significantly higher to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Exclusivity:**  Using terms like ""exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, you immediately sell to John at $1,200,000.  There's a trade-off between aiming high and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
