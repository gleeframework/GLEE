"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. If you're not willing to go that low, I might have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but $9,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still $1,000 below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll find anywhere. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
