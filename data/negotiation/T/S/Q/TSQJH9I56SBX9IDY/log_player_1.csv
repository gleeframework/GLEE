Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price.  This gives Bob the chance to negotiate, but also sets a clear boundary that I won't go below."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway,  offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price and only a small amount less than John's offer.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing out to John."
