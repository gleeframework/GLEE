"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Your goal:** Save money.
* **Alice's offer:** $120
* **John's price:** $150
* **Value to you:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $30 compared to buying from John.  Even though it's more than Alice's value, it's within your budget and a better deal than John's."
