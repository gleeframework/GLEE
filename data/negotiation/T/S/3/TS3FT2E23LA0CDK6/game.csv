"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $13,250. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,250 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $13,400, which is a very fair price considering the value of the product. This would be a great outcome for both of us. What do you think?",13400.0,Alice,5,
