# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.
