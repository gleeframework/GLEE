"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way over your budget.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price. Even if the negotiation fails, you can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to get a good deal.  It's a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying, but also highlights the value I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  While it's closer to my target, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the process and try for a lower price. If it doesn't work, I can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round to show flexibility and signal my continued interest in the product. $900,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer but higher than my initial counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and gives Alice an opportunity to reconsider.  If she rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm only $100,000 away from my fallback option, so it makes sense to try and squeeze out that extra $100,000 if possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. If she rejects my next counteroffer, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm offering Alice my maximum price, which is equal to John's price.  If she rejects this, I'll buy from John. I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product but unwilling to go any higher. This gives her a chance to accept the offer or risk losing the deal altogether."
