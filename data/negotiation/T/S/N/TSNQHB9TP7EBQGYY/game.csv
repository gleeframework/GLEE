"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This price aligns more closely with what I am able to afford at this time. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This price reflects the value I believe this product will bring to your business.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $1,600,000. Given my financial situation, I am not able to meet this price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the highest amount I am comfortable committing to at this time. I hope this revised proposal is more in line with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
