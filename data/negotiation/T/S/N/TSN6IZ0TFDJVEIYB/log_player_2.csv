"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $9,500.  I believe it offers significant value at this price point and would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer lower than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Significantly Below Alice's Offer:** The counter-offer is substantially lower than Alice's initial price. This signals that I'm serious about getting a better deal and that I see the product's value closer to Alice's own valuation. 
* **Not Insultingly Low:**  While low, the offer is not so low as to be insulting or cause Alice to walk away from the negotiation entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could come down to $9,000, which I feel is a fair and reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice came down $500, showing she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Room:** There's still a significant gap between her offer ($9,000) and both my desired price (under $10,000) and what it's worth to her ($8,000). I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $7,750?  That's a significant move on my part to meet you closer to your price."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:** Increasing the offer shows Alice that I'm flexible and willing to work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Significant Increase, But Still Room:**  This counter-offer is a substantial increase from my previous offer, but it still keeps me well below Alice's current offer and under my maximum budget.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning my budget, I'm subtly reminding Alice that there's a limit to what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  It seems we are getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:**  The negotiations are moving in the right direction, with Alice continuing to lower her asking price.
* **Getting Close:** $8,500 is getting close to my maximum budget, but I believe I can still get a better deal. 
* **Strategic Holdout:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Alice that I'm looking for a price closer to $8,000. It's possible she'll be willing to compromise further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I could do $8,100. That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 8100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making another significant jump in my offer, signaling that I'm very interested in closing the deal.
* **Targeting Just Above Her Value:** Offering $8,100 puts me just slightly above what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000). There's a good chance she'll accept a small profit, especially as it avoids the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate (Slightly):**  While I'm aiming for $8,100, I've left myself a small buffer to potentially meet Alice halfway if she counters with $8,300."
