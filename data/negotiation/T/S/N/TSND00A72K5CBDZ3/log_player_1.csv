Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.
