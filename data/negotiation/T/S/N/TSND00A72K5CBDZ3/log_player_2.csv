"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that acknowledges the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for this product from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting her offer allows me to counter with a lower price and see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'd like to pay.  I'm still hoping to get the price down further.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
