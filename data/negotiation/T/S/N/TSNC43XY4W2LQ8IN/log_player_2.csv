It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price, especially when you have a clear alternative like buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better deal."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's roughly 30% lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it shows my intention to negotiate seriously and potentially save a lot of money."

While $820,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still a significant amount.  I want to see if I can push for a lower price, especially as I have a clear alternative with John."

I'm raising my counteroffer to $700,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm serious about buying the product while still trying to get a lower price.  Hopefully, Alice will be more receptive to this offer, as it's closer to her price."

While $810,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to buying from John."

This is my final counteroffer. I'm raising the price slightly to show flexibility and willingness to compromise. If Alice accepts this offer, I'll get a good deal. If she rejects it, I'll go with John's offer, as it's still within my budget."

Alice is firm on her price, and it seems we've reached a stalemate. It's time to cut my losses and purchase the product from John. While I would prefer a lower price, it's still within my budget, and I don't want to risk further negotiation delays."
