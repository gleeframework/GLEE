Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. Let me know if you're interested, this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's primary goal is to get the highest price possible.  
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation, but higher than her minimum.
* **Time Constraint:**  The offer includes a 24-hour deadline to encourage a decision. This prevents Bob from stalling and gives Alice the option to go to John if needed.

**Why this strategy?**

This offer aims to strike a balance between:

* **Attracting Bob:** The price is lower than Bob's valuation, providing a potential profit for him if he chooses to resell. 
* **Securing a High Price for Alice:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John.

This approach gives Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit while still leaving room for Bob to potentially accept a beneficial deal."
