"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,500, which is halfway between my minimum price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of its worth. 

This strategy aims to initiate a negotiation that could lead to a successful deal in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Potential for improvement:** Although Bob has rejected my initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer, potentially leading to a deal closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is the fallback:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, selling to John for $15,000 ensures I achieve my minimum goal. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a compromise that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is just below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This gives you a fair price, and I still get a reasonable profit.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer by lowering my price to $13,000, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I emphasize ""fair price"" for Bob, focusing on finding a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob. 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground that could lead to a successful deal in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation room:** Although Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, there's still room to negotiate.  I can make another counteroffer, potentially reaching a deal closer to my desired price.
* **John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, selling to John for $15,000 ensures I achieve my minimum goal.

**Next Steps:** I'll proceed to round 5 and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a final agreement that is mutually beneficial."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. Let's split the difference and go with $12,750.  I believe this price is fair to both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final offer before considering selling to John. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This offer is halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's latest offer ($12,500). 
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting this as the final offer, aiming to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing fairness to both parties to make the offer more appealing.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for compromise:**  Bob's offer remains at $12,500, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation exhausted:**  We've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.
