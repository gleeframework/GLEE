"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
