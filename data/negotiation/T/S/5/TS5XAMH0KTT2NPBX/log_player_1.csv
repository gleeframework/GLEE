Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I also want to keep the negotiation open for a potential counteroffer. $1,200,000 is a good compromise between my minimum value and Bob's perceived value.  I'll be ready to counter if needed, and I'm always aware of John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is far too low for me. While I want to close the deal, I need to stay close to my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my desired price. How about $1,050,000? This allows both of us to meet halfway and close this deal. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's my final offer. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I need to prioritize my financial goals and ensure I get a price that meets my minimum value.  Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome."
