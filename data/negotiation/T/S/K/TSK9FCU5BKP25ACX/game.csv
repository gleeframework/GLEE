"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm confident that it can bring you substantial returns. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $812,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",812500.0,Bob,4,
