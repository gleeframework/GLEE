Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it'd be perfect for you! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair offer:** It's above your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong offer:** It's a good starting point that might tempt Bob into accepting. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate and potentially increase the price.

Remember, the goal is to get the highest price possible, but also to keep the negotiation going so you can potentially get an even better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below the value you placed on the product ($100).  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can reach a price that's more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal considering how much you'll get out of this product! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $95.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $92.50.  That's the best I can do, and it's still a good value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $92.50 is a good compromise. It's higher than selling to John, and it's close to your preferred price. Further negotiation might be possible, but it's likely to be time-consuming and there's a chance you could lose Bob as a buyer. It's best to accept the offer and secure the sale."
