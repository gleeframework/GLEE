"Hey Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal considering how much you'll get out of this product! What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $95.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $92.50.  That's the best I can do, and it's still a good value for me.",92.5,Bob,4,
