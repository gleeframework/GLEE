"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000. How about we settle on $11,250? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not able to go lower than $11,000.  It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. If you're truly interested in making this deal work, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a final offer of $11,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'd like to add a condition. Would you be willing to include a 2-year warranty with the product? That would make it a more attractive offer for me.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $10,500 is still below my minimum price point, and I'm not able to offer a 2-year warranty at this price. I'm willing to come down to $10,750, which is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
