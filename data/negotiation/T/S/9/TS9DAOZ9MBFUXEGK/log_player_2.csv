"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate further. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's still room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $102. It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $102 is now within your budget of $120. While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a good chance you won't get a significantly better price. Accepting this offer saves you time and potentially avoids a longer negotiation process."
