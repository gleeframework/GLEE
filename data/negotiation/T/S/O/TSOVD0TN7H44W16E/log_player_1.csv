``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get the negotiation going.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, aiming to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell for less, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still below my target. I'm going to reject this offer and keep negotiating. I'm hoping I can get a little bit closer to my $1,000,000 goal.  The value of the product to John is a strong backup, giving me confidence to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still significantly less than what this product is worth to you.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This would give us both a fair deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $975,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.

While $975,000 is getting close, I'm still within reach of my target price of $1,000,000.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate.  I don't want to sell for less than my minimum, especially with John as a reliable backup."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I understand you're firm on $975,000, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's split the difference again.

Bob's offer is below my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk ending up with less than my minimum. John is a reliable buyer and I can sell to him for $1,000,000. It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and go with the sure thing."
