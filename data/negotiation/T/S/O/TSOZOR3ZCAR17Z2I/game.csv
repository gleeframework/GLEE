"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a fair price considering the market value of the product is around $8,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the market value, however, this product has unique features that make it worth more than the standard. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth the premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,250. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the unique features you mentioned.",11250.0,Bob,4,
