"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad you think it's worth $700,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Can you consider meeting me at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
