"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, getting closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is closer to my walk-away price ($12,000 from John) but still gives Alice a chance to make a profit. 
* **Respectful Tone:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice meeting me in the middle at $12,250 is a reasonable compromise. While I could try to negotiate further, it's only a $250 difference from my best alternative (buying from John). Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice retracting the offer and potentially losing out on the deal entirely."
