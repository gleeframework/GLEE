"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $12,500. This is my final offer, so let me know if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $13,000, which is still over Bob's budget.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point.  John is offering the product for $12,000, which fits within Bob's budget.  Therefore, Bob should buy the product from John."
