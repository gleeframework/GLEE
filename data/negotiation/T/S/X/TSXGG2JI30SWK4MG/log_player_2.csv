Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway at this point, offering her $700,000. It's closer to her last offer, but still within my budget. If she rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  I'm not comfortable going higher than $700,000, so it's time to cut my losses and buy from John. While I'm not getting the ideal price, it's still better than continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially ending up with nothing."
