Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage. You should aim for a price higher than $12,000 from Bob. However, you need to be realistic. If you ask for too much more, Bob will likely refuse.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I value this product highly, but I'm willing to part with it for $13,500.  This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Creating Value Perception:**  The message subtly emphasizes that Bob is getting a first-mover advantage. 
* **Strong but Fair Price:** The price of $13,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it's not so high that it's insulting.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a time limit can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially prevent him from overthinking or trying to negotiate.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob rejects your offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer. Don't be afraid to stick to your minimum price.
* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be ready to negotiate if he counters, but stay firm on your minimum."
