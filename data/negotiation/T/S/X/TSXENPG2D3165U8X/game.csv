"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
