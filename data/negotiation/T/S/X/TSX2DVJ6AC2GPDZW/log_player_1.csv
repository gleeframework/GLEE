{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I've chosen to start with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This is a common strategy in negotiations, as it gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Expressing openness to negotiation:** I've mentioned that I'm ""open to negotiation,"" indicating flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I've emphasized the product's value to Bob, implying that the price is justified.

This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation process. It's important to remember that this is just the first step, and I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the ongoing negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but I am only able to offer $14000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but there's still room for improvement.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, but I believe I can get more from Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to accept $14,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counter-offer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a firm stance on the value of the product.
* **Positive Language:** I've started the message with ""I appreciate your offer,"" fostering a more collaborative tone and showing respect for Bob's position. 
* **Reiteration of Value:**  The phrase ""what I'm looking for"" subtly reinforces that I believe the product is worth more than $14,000.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am unable to go above $14000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stood firm at $14,000.  While this is less than my initial desired price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Further negotiation may result in a slight increase, but it's likely that Bob won't budge further.  It's not worth risking a deal for a small potential gain, especially since I have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation."
