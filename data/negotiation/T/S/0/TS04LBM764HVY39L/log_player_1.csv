Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message keeps the conversation open. Bob's response will guide your next move.  You can then decide to negotiate down, but stay firm on a price that's significantly higher than your backup offer from John."
