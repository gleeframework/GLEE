Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your ideal price.
* **Balancing Act:**  The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but the message frames it as a ""fair price"" to encourage him to consider it. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible deal while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
