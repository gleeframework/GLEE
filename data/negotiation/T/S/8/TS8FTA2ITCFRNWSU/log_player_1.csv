Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $19,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states  ""open to discussing a price that works for us both,"" signaling to Bob that there's flexibility.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** While you have John as a backup, aiming higher than $15,000 makes sense. If Bob is willing to pay even slightly more, it's a better outcome for you.
* **Confident but not Aggressive:** The language is positive and emphasizes the product's value to Bob without being overly pushy. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still making a profit that's worthwhile over selling to John directly."
