{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Alice will significantly lower her offer.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I've already saved a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer, and it's not worth the risk of missing out on the product entirely."
