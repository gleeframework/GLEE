Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $15,000 is a significant starting point, allowing for negotiation space while still ensuring a substantial profit. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider its worth. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly indicates a willingness to negotiate, creating a more receptive atmosphere.

This initial offer sets a strong starting point while leaving room for flexibility throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value of the product:**  The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  While Bob is offering my minimum price, I believe there's potential to get a higher price through further negotiation. 
* **Negotiation tactic:**  Rejecting the offer will demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a better price and that I'm not willing to settle for the minimum.

I will proceed with a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  Let's try $12,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Offering $12,000 is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  $12,000 still allows me to make a profit while being more realistic than my initial offer.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message leaves room for further discussion and potential adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'm accepting the offer, I'm not completely closing the door on potentially getting a higher price if Bob is willing to counter. 
* **Time factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially take longer and I might not be able to get a better price. Accepting the offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit.

This decision balances the need for a fair price with the reality of the negotiation process and the potential risks of further haggling."
