"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a fair price. Let me know if that works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make a final offer of $92. This is a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your price without compromising on my own needs. Let me know what you think!",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and my original offer of $85, which would be $88.50. Would you be willing to accept this price?",88.5,Bob,6,
