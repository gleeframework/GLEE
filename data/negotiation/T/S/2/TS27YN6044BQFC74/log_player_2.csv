"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a better price than John's $150, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm motivated to sell, $130 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $135 is still within Bob's budget of $150. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting the offer at this point avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the negotiation taking too long. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate could take up valuable rounds, potentially leading to a scenario where Bob has to buy from John at $150.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $135 is the most sensible option to ensure Bob gets the product while still saving money compared to buying from John."
