Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this, and if not, we can go from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that Bob is willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still holding out for a better price than John's $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I would ideally get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. I'll accept his offer."
