Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Why this price?** I'm offering the product at the minimum price that I'm willing to accept, as I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who will pay that amount. 
* **The message:**  I'm keeping the message short and to the point, highlighting the value to Bob and emphasizing a fair deal.

By offering the minimum I'm willing to accept, I maximize my chances of getting the highest possible price while still securing the sale."
