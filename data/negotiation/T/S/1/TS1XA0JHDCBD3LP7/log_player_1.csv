"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This sets a high starting point for the negotiation and allows for some room to lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm rejecting it.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to accept anything below my minimum. I'm prepared to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm making a counteroffer of $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also ensures I don't lose out on a substantial profit."
