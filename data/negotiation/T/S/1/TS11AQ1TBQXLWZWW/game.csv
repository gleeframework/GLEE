"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $12,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $11,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
