"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but not outrageous offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:**  A high initial offer acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and setting a higher baseline for subsequent offers.
* **Confidence:** The message exudes confidence in the product's value, which can subtly influence Bob's perception.

This strategy allows for flexibility and exploration of Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is exceptional, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you.  It's important to demonstrate that you're serious about negotiating a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's exceptional qualities while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While rejecting Bob's low offer, you're showing a willingness to negotiate by making a substantial concession from your initial price. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price point, preventing the appearance of simply haggling.
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to establish a more reasonable middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.

You're still leaving room for further negotiation while staying well above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, accepting now guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
