Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding John's offer ($1,200,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
