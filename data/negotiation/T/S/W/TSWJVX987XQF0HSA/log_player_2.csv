# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to work with you to make this happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
