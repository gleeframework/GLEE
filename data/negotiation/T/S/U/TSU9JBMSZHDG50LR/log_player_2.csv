Given its importance to both of us, I am extending this exclusive offer to you at a price of $800,000. This amount reflects a fair valuation considering its worth to you and the potential it holds for both parties. I believe this is a mutually beneficial proposition that allows you to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price. I look forward to discussing the details further and hearing your response. Kind regards, Alice.
