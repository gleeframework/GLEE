"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

You can save $25,000 by accepting Alice's offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up buying from John for $800,000."
