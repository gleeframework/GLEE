You're still $3,000 over your ideal price.  While Alice is coming down, it's worth seeing if you can negotiate further.  A counteroffer will show you're serious about buying but still within your budget."

You're still above your ideal price.  The difference is only $2,500 now, so it's worth seeing if you can get Alice to move a little further."

You've reached a point where Alice is willing to go down to $10,000, but you're still $2,000 above your desired price. You've already invested a lot of time in negotiating with Alice, and it seems like she's unwilling to go lower.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
