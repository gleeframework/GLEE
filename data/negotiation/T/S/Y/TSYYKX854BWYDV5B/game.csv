"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll see a return on this investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
