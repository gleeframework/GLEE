"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offers.
* **Justification:**  The message highlights the product's ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though you're willing to accept less. 
* **Alternative:** Having John as a backup buyer willing to pay your minimum price gives you leverage in the negotiation.  

By starting high, Alice leaves room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price. Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer wouldn't be the most profitable decision.  It's worth negotiating further to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer closer to her target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my initial offer reflects the unique features and potential this product offers, which I believe will be highly beneficial for you.  To move towards a mutually agreeable outcome, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice is making a significant concession by dropping $150,000 from her initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm (for now):** She's still well above Bob's offer and her minimum, maintaining a strong position.
* **Reiterating Value:** Alice subtly reminds Bob of the product's benefits to justify the still-high price.

This counter-offer balances making progress in the negotiation while not conceding too much too quickly.  It will be interesting to see Bob's response and if he's willing to move closer to Alice's range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit outside my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches Alice's minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay.  While there might be a small chance of getting a slightly higher price from Bob, it's a minimal risk compared to the potential of Bob walking away. Accepting this offer ensures Alice gets her desired amount without dragging on the negotiation."
