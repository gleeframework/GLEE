"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product could be beneficial, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I could consider letting it go for $1,500,000. This is a fair offer, reflecting the value this product brings.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $950,000. This is a significant investment on my part and would have to be my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my absolute lowest price for this product is $1,300,000. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the value you'll be getting.  I need to be firm on this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This is my final offer, as I need to be mindful of my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
