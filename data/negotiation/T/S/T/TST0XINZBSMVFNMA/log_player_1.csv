"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start high ($1,450,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This gives us room to negotiate while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Confident Tone:** We project confidence in the product's value to influence Bob's perception.
* **Focus on Value:** We emphasize the product's potential benefits to Bob, not just its features.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's eagerness:**  A quick acceptance indicates we could have aimed higher. 
2. **Establish a strong negotiating position:** Starting high gives us leverage in subsequent rounds. 
3. **Leave room for concessions:** We can gradually decrease the price to entice Bob while staying above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both our minimum ($1,200,000) and his perceived value ($1,500,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to what we can gain from either John or a successful negotiation with Bob.  

By rejecting this lowball offer, we signal that we're serious about the product's value and willing to walk away from a bad deal. This sets the stage for a counteroffer in the next round where we can steer the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the value this product brings. To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $1,350,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and still provides you with a significant advantage."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We decrease our price by $100,000, a significant amount that might entice Bob, but we stay well above his initial offer and our minimum price.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the value proposition, emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the new price for both parties.
* **Holding Firm:** By using phrases like ""go as low as,"" we imply this is our best offer, pushing Bob to make a more serious counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:** We're not desperate, and this counteroffer reflects that.
* **Encourage Bob to move closer to our range:** By making a substantial concession, we hope Bob reciprocates with a more reasonable offer.
* **Avoid a stalemate:**  While we want a good price, we also want to avoid protracted negotiations that could lead to losing both Bob and John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product holds, but I have budgetary constraints to consider. Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk:

* **Bob's limit:**  This offer might be very close to Bob's actual limit, and pushing further could make him walk away.
* **John's offer:**  While John offers $1,200,000, Bob's offer provides a $25,000 profit margin. 
* **Time:** We're already in Round 4. Prolonging negotiations increases the chance of losing both Bob and John if an agreement isn't reached soon.

Accepting Bob's offer at this stage secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
