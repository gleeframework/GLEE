Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still earning a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $11,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than the product's value to me ($12,000), I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

Let's say I'll offer it to him for $11,800. This is still lower than my initial offer, but it's closer to the product's value to me.
