"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is above your maximum value of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves some room for you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum value. You can still try to negotiate a lower price. You have enough rounds left to continue haggling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $900,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum value of $1,000,000, but it is getting closer. It's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate for a lower price. You still have enough rounds left to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum value of $1,000,000.  While you've managed to negotiate a lower price, you only have 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to your desired price.  It's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
