"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a product worth $1,500,000 to you at a significant discount. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000,  which still leaves some room for profit for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow us both to walk away happy.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. That's a fair price, considering it's your own valuation of the product.  It's a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
