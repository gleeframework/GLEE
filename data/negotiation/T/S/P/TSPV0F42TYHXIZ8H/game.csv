"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  How about we start at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I can be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $750,000?  I think that's a fair price that considers the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about $825,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
