"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There is room for Alice to go lower, as she values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's value as possible. By offering $12,500, Bob demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for Alice to potentially make a slight profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial offer, there is still room for further negotiation. Bob can likely secure a price closer to his target by making another counteroffer.  This is especially true because John's price of $15,000 provides a clear alternative if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He has moved up from his previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $12,800 is still a good deal for Bob, and leaves a bit of room for Alice to profit while remaining below Bob's maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice is now closer to Bob's maximum threshold.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and John's offer of $15,000 presents a clear alternative.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $13,400 is the most sensible option."
