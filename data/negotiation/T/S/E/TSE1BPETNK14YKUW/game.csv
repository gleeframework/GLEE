"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $10,800 is a bit steep. How about $10,500 isn't an option, but $10,600 is?",10600.0,Bob,6,
