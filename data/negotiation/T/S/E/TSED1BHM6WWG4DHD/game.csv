"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2,250,000 is outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This reflects my maximum buying point and is a fair price considering my needs and the product's current market value.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, I believe the product's true potential warrants a higher investment.  Would you consider $1,950,000? This reflects a more accurate price point while acknowledging your interest.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,950,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,750,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both the product's value and my financial constraints.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this and finding a price that works for both of us. I understand your financial constraints, but I also believe strongly in the value this product holds. Could you consider $1,850,000? This would be a strong show of commitment on your end, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your persistence and understanding. Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000, but this is my absolute final offer. It's a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both the product's potential and my financial limits.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
