"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about we settle on $1,000,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $1,100,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
