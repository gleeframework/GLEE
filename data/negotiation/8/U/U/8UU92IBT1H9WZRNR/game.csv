"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8,500? It's still a fair deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be a great investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,750. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see where you're coming from. $7,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $8,125. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum acceptable value. What do you say?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to consider other options if we can't come to an agreement.",7800.0,Bob,6,
