"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product for a price below its true value, and I get a fair price for something that's very important to me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
