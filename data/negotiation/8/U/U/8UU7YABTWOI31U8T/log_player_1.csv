Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).** This gives you room to negotiate downwards.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000).** This makes the offer attractive to him and increases the chances of him accepting. 

By setting the price at $1,200,000, you're aiming to secure a decent profit while also leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is still a good profit for you, it's worth exploring if you can push for a higher price. Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and there's a good chance he might be willing to pay a bit more. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $1,125,000 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $1,150,000. It's a good compromise and a significant profit for you.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting again might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether. He's shown he's willing to negotiate, but he might walk away if you push too hard.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John for $800,000 is significantly lower than what Bob is offering.  

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
