Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a decent starting point, higher than Bob's perceived value but not so high that it's immediately rejected. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation without immediately needing to drop to John's offer.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone helps to keep the negotiation open and avoid any potential tension. 
 
**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! You've made a good deal.
* **Bob Rejects:**  Assess Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation Stalls:** If the negotiation seems to be going nowhere, consider switching to John's offer of $15,000 to secure the sale."
