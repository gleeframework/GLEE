Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a backup offer from John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position. Bob gains $300,000 in value if he buys from you ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000). You can aim for a price that captures some of that value while still ensuring a deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
* **Strong Price:** $1,350,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while leaving Bob with a $150,000 gain.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong opening, it leaves a little room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You could start higher and be willing to negotiate down, or you could offer a slightly lower price to increase the chances of a quick deal."
