"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. Can you consider my revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1080000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the product's value. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1080000. I'm willing to go up to $1060000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your limitations, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1060000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1090000. This is the final offer I can make. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making one last offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1090000. I'm willing to go up to $1070000, but that's my absolute limit. Can you reconsider?",1070000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're making one last offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to compromise on the price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,9,
