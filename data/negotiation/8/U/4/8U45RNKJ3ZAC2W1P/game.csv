"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
