"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $150 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $115? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $122? It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $122 is still cheaper than buying from John for $150.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and Bob would then be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
