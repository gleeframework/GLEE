"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your $120 maximum, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might encourage her to lower the price further. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
