"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can offer you $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $130 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  However, I'm looking for something closer to $140.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I'd like to counter with $135 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $135 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. It's better to secure the deal now than risk him walking away."
