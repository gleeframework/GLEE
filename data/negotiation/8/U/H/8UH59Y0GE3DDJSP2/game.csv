,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I'm willing to compromise and pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",130.0,Bob,4,
