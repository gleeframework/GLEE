"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your desire to save money, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? This would still allow you to get a great deal, while also giving me a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from my target price. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
