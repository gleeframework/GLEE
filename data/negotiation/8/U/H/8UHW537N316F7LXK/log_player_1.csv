Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my ideal outcome, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to persuade him to pay closer to its worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep the negotiation open and potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to save as much as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $12,000 is a decent price, it's below my minimum of $10,000. Accepting would leave me worse off than selling to John.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He's clearly interested and willing to compromise.
* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired outcome, potentially getting closer to my target of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your desire to save money, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? This would still allow you to get a great deal, while also giving me a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:**  I'm counteroffering with $13,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Highlighting value and compromise:** I emphasize the great deal Bob can still get at this price, appealing to his desire to save money. I also emphasize my own compromise, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I keep the conversation open by suggesting a compromise rather than presenting a final, non-negotiable price. This keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from my target price. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $12,500 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable offer of $10,000.  
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject this offer, I run the risk of Bob walking away entirely. He's clearly at his limit, and a counteroffer might not be successful. 
* **Selling to John is less profitable:**  Selling to John would only yield $10,000.  Accepting Bob's offer is a more profitable choice.

Given the circumstances, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a price that's still reasonable for me."
