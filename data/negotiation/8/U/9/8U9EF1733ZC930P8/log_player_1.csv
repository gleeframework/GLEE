Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  Bob's offers are still too low, and we've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.  It's better to secure a sale with John and ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price."
