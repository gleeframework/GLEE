"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($150) to give myself some room for negotiation. 
* **Positivity:** I'm starting with a friendly and positive message to build rapport. 
* **Opening for negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is still interested, so there's an opportunity to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While $120 is my minimum, I'd prefer to make more if possible through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize compromise:**  I'm using language like ""meet in the middle"" to show flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Keep the conversation positive:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $130 is getting closer.  How about we split the difference and do $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further room for negotiation:**  There's no point in rejecting this offer and trying to get more, as I could end up selling to John for the same price.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already halfway through the rounds, so it's important to secure the deal."
