"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the value the product brings to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate further. While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and would allow me to make a worthwhile investment. I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
