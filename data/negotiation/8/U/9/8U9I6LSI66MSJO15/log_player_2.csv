"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than $100, but considering your perspective, I propose a price of $120. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction. If this proposal suits you, please let me know so we can proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price further. If she doesn't, you're still guaranteed the product at your desired price point from John."
