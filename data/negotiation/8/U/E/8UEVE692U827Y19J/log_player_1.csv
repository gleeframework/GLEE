Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $149 is a strong starting point. It's just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, which could lead to you getting even closer to your $150 goal."
