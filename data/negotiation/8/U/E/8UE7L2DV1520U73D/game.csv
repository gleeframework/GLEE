"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value. However, $12000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $10500.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think the product is worth more than $10500.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11200 is closer, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $10800.  It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000.
