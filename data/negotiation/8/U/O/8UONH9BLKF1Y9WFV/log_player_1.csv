Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. It's important to note that John is a safety net, so I can afford to be a bit more assertive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I need to reject it. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? That's still a great deal for a product this valuable."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can do $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer $100,  Bob's offer of $95 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price and closer to my desired outcome than selling to John for $100. It's a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it."
