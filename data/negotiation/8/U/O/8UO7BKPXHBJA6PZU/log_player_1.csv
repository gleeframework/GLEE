Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to maximize my potential profit. Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for less than John's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price and potentially sway him emotionally. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message uses phrases like ""proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" to signal a willingness to negotiate, allowing Bob to feel involved in the process. 

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation and Bob's potential rejection."
