You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 represents its true value, I understand you're working within a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $75 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  This product is really worth a lot more to you than that! I could consider $85, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower and is holding firm above your $80 limit. It's time to cut your losses and go with your backup plan of buying from John."
