,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider buying it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 represents its true value, I understand you're working within a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $90 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to come down to $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $75 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  This product is really worth a lot more to you than that! I could consider $85, and that's my final offer.",85.0,Alice,5,
