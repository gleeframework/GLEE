Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to consider something closer to $1,200,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
