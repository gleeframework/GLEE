"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. Let me know your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to consider something closer to $1,200,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below the product's value.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us. Consider it a final offer before I move on to other potential buyers.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand the product's value, but my budget is firm.  Would you be open to $1,250,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go. If this doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let me know your decision.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
