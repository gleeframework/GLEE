Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and prevents me from immediately settling for less.
* **Addressing Bob's perspective:**  I acknowledge the product's value to Bob, hinting at potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $900,000 price gives me space to counter if Bob proposes a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  I've secured a profitable sale!
* If Bob rejects: I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If negotiations stall: I have the option to sell to John for my minimum desired price, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's initial counteroffer is low, his message indicates a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially bringing him closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $700,000 but lower than my initial $900,000 offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I can't accept $700,000, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while recognizing the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring a good return on my product.
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, reinforcing the idea of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  The message ends on a positive note, inviting further discussion and suggesting that a mutually acceptable price can be reached. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Excellent! I've secured a solid price for the product.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If negotiations stall:  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, ensuring a safe fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a quick deal:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating he's unlikely to negotiate further. Accepting avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential for a lower price.
* **Minimizing risk:** While I could try to counter, there's no guarantee of a better offer. Accepting  a price close to my minimum is a safe strategy.

**Next Steps:**

* I've successfully negotiated a price that's close to my minimum desired value. I can move forward with the sale to Bob and secure a profitable deal."
