"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a common negotiation tactic to establish a lower price point and demonstrate Bob's serious intent to purchase.  The offer is still within Bob's budget, but provides ample room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is a little low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit above Bob's ideal price point, but closer to his maximum budget.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer again, potentially closing the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value of the product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer to $9,500. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. It also puts him closer to Alice's most recent offer, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still maintaining some room for compromise."
