Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure $102.50 is enough for me, but I'm getting closer to your price. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110.  While you *might* be able to haggle her down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her going higher or the time investment when you have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John."
