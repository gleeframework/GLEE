"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $95? That's a fair bit closer to your price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $125, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could meet you halfway between our last two offers at $102.50.  What do you think?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $102.50 is enough for me, but I'm getting closer to your price. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",115.0,Alice,7,
