"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,000,000 is considerably below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you value the product highly. However,  $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000.   Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
