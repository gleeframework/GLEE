{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's still potential to negotiate further, and rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer. This strategy keeps the pressure on Alice and aims to secure a better price."
