Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. 
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive message might make Bob more receptive to the initial offer.
* **Asking for opinion:**  Asking for Bob's opinion can encourage him to engage in the negotiation and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. This is a good opportunity to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's  the average of my minimum and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and optimistic to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding ""let's make this deal work"" to subtly imply that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also ready to move on to other buyers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $78. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that Bob might not be willing to budge further, and the negotiation could drag on.  Selling to John for $80 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
