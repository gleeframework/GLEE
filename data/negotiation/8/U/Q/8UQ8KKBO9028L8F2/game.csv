"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",10600.0,Bob,4,
