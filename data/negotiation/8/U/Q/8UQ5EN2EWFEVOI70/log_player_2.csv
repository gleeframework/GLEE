"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards your $80 target, even considering John's backup offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but could you do it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to establish a lower baseline for the negotiation. 
* **Leaves Room to Negotiate:**  While $60 is a low starting point, it leaves room to gradually increase your offer towards your $80 maximum if needed.
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John's offer in your back pocket gives you some leverage. If Alice completely refuses to budge on price, you have an alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price and John's offer. 
* **Alice is Flexible:**  Alice moving from $120 to $90 indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's a good chance you can get her price lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting carries a small risk that Alice might walk away, but the potential reward of getting a lower price is worth it at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I was hoping to keep it under $80.  Would you be willing to do $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:**  Acknowledging Alice's effort to meet you halfway helps maintain a good negotiation dynamic.
* **Firm but Fair:** The $70 counteroffer moves towards a possible compromise while still remaining below your $80 maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how flexible Alice is and potentially lead to a final agreement in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to keep it under $80, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really benefit from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $85 is only slightly above your $80 target and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Unlikely to Improve:**  Alice has made several concessions.  Pushing further for $80 might make her walk away, forcing you to buy from John anyway. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a small chance of saving you a few dollars but could drag on. Accepting now secures a good price and ends the process."
