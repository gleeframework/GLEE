Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
