"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $800,000, so this is a good start. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's space for him to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows confidence:**  Starting high shows you believe in the value of your product and are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **You have more leverage:**  You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, but you also have John as a backup buyer.  This gives you the ability to hold out for a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll counteroffer Bob in Round 3, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer while still holding firm on your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Meeting halfway (sort of):**  $850,000 is the midpoint between your desired price of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $700,000. 
* **Presenting a fair deal:** This offer gives Bob a good price while still allowing you to make a significant profit. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll see how Bob responds to this counteroffer in Round 4. If he rejects, you'll need to decide whether to offer a further compromise or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and land at $775,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below $800,000.  You shouldn't settle for less than your minimum, especially since you have a backup buyer.
* **You have leverage:**  You've shown flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but you also have a guaranteed sale with John. This gives you the power to push for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll counteroffer Bob in Round 5, aiming to get closer to your desired price while staying above your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to make a deal, but $775,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This would allow you to get a great deal on the product while ensuring I'm compensated fairly. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above minimum:**  This offer is still above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a decent profit.
* **Showing willingness to compromise:** You're coming down slightly from your previous offer, indicating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing value:** You're reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential for a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response in Round 6, you'll need to decide whether to make another concession or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to bump my offer to $800,000. That's a fair price that considers both of our positions.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting your minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 aligns perfectly with your minimum acceptable price. This ensures you make a decent profit.
* **Time pressure:** You're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds potentially resulting in a lower offer from Bob. 
* **No need for further negotiation:**  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Bob is now willing to meet your minimum. There's no need to risk delaying the deal further.

**Next Steps:**

You'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal, securing a profit of $800,000."
