"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and land at $775,000? ",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to make a deal, but $775,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This would allow you to get a great deal on the product while ensuring I'm compensated fairly. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
