"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $825,000. How about we meet at $780,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go much higher than that.",780000.0,Bob,4,
