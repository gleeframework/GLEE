"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,120.0
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $120, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a good deal for you. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still think the product is worth more than $100. How about we try $110? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for what you'll be getting.",110.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm still not quite there.  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $95? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",95.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,105.0
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110, so how about $102.50? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",102.5,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $98.75?  I'm sure this is a price we can both agree on.",98.75,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,105.0
"I'm not quite ready to settle on $98.75, Bob. I think the product is worth a bit more than that. Let's try $105 again, and see if we can meet in the middle from there.",105.0,Alice,9,,
