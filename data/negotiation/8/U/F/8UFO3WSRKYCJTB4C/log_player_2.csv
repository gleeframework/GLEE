"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try to negotiate a better price.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Let's start with a strong counteroffer. Since John is selling for $1,000,000, let's see if Alice will match that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

We're getting closer!  Alice is willing to come down a bit. Let's see if we can get her to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Let's try a price slightly higher than John's offer, but still lower than Alice's. This might be a good middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now offering $1,100,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's a good price. We can get a lower price from John, but it's always good to have a backup option.  Let's go for it!"
