Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. However, $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would that work for you?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob is unlikely to move much higher and I have a guaranteed offer for $10,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
