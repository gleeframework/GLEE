Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. This demonstrates flexibility while trying to secure a price that's closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is now just $5 below my minimum. It's a good compromise, and it's better to close the deal rather than risk further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for the same price."
