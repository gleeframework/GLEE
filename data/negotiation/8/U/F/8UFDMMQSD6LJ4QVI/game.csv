"Alice, thank you for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1 million.  Would you be willing to consider $1000000?  I believe this price still provides a good return for you and gives me a reasonable deal.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the original price, but I'm still looking to make a good profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
