,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? That's a good price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know if you're interested.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is too low for you, Alice, but I'm still trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000. How about $775,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $775,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's split the difference and go with $787,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good investment for you.  Let me know what you think.",787500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $787,500. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $780,000? It's a bit above my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something we can agree on.",780000.0,Bob,6,
