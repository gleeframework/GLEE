"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll consider selling the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
