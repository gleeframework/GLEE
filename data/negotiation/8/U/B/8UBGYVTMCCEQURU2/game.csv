"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I can do $105.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. I can do $98. That's the lowest I can go.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $98 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $104.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",104.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. I can do $102. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  How about $103? It's just a dollar more than your offer and still gives you a great deal on a product that's worth more to you.",103.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my target, but I still need to save a bit more. I can do $101. That's the best I can do.",101.0,Bob,8,
