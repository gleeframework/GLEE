I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $160. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
