"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significant, and $700,000 is considerably below what I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $875,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
