"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset. While I cannot disclose the specifics at this stage, let's just say it's worth a minimum of $1000000 to me.  I'm confident it holds significant potential for you as well.  I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, it falls a bit short of what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down a little and offer the product to you for $1250000. This price reflects a compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as John's offer is only slightly higher, and I may be able to get a better deal with Alice."
