{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150 starting price:** This is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** This signals flexibility and makes Bob more likely to engage in a conversation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to create interest.

This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process. I'm confident that $150 is a fair price, but I'm prepared to negotiate to get the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore if I can get a better price. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round with a price slightly higher than $120, hoping to secure a deal closer to my initial asking price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $135? It's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with justification:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but explaining my reasoning. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Emphasize value:**  I highlight that the price is still a ""good deal"" for Bob to maintain his interest.
* **Focus on fair profit:**  I subtly mention my need for a ""fair profit"" to make it clear that I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is only $5 less than my previous counteroffer and is significantly closer to my initial asking price of $150. It's also a good deal for me, as it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting his offer allows me to finalize the sale and earn a decent profit without risking further negotiation and the potential for a lower price."
