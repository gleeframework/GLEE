"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $1,050,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some space for Alice to counter without going below her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than what Bob can get from John. While the difference is shrinking, Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer allows him to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing his willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is still a significant discount compared to Alice's initial offer, but closer to her latest offer. This allows for some wiggle room while still keeping Bob within his desired budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than what Bob can get from John, but it's getting closer to his maximum budget. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to another buyer increases with each round. It's becoming increasingly likely that Alice won't budge further, and there's a chance she'll eventually accept John's offer. Therefore, accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of losing it altogether."
