Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $950,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we settle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,025,000 is a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a higher price, but also the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating is time you could be using the funds from the sale elsewhere."
