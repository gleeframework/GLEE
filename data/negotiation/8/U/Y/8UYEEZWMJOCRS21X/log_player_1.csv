Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $120 by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering at $115. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that gives Bob a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $102 is only slightly lower than what John is willing to pay. I'm going to accept this offer to avoid risking losing the sale completely."
