"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, creating a collaborative tone.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not making it a take-it-or-leave-it offer, indicating I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's still a great deal, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** While $900,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired value.
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting allows me to keep pushing for a higher price and see if Bob is willing to budge further. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have the secure option of selling to John for $1,200,000, giving me the leverage to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. How about $950,000? That's still a great price for you and allows me to get closer to my desired value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** Offering a price halfway between our previous offers shows good faith and willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterating Value:** Emphasizing ""great price for you"" reinforces Bob's potential benefit while subtly reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with a question invites Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $925000? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** While $925,000 is getting closer to my desired value, it's still not ideal. 
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe I can push Bob a little further by rejecting and counteroffering. 
* **John's Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do right now.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 940000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only moving down $10,000 from my previous offer, showing that I'm serious about a deal but not willing to give away too much.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" for both of us to create a sense of shared benefit and encourage acceptance.
* **Urgency:**  Saying ""Let's make this happen"" adds a slight sense of urgency and encourages Bob to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try to get closer to my target price? What if we meet at $915000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** $915,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired value.
* **Limited Room for Compromise:**  I've already made multiple concessions, and Bob hasn't budged much. Accepting this offer might be a good outcome, but I still have some leverage.
* **John's Offer:** Knowing I can get $1,200,000 from John gives me the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob, or, if necessary, walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I can offer you the product for $930,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of this unique product.  I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 930000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Stating it's my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept before he loses the opportunity.
* **Focus on Value:** Reminding Bob of the ""unique value"" of the product helps justify the price and encourages him to see it as a good investment.
* **Closing Statement:**  The message ends with a positive note (""great deal for both of us"") and invites Bob to accept, leaving the ball in his court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we try $920000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Minimum:**  $920,000 is extremely close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a significant loss compared to what I could get from John.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and Bob's offers haven't been moving in my direction significantly.
* **Time and Risk:**  With only two rounds left, the potential for a better outcome with Bob is slim.  It's not worth the risk of losing a substantial amount of money.
* **John's Security:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than what I'm currently offered by Bob.

It's time to take the guaranteed profit and move on."
