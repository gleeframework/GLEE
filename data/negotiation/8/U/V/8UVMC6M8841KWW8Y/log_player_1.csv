Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a price above your minimum.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  A price closer to Bob's perceived value ($100) might make him more likely to consider the offer, even if it's still a significant markup. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring a sale, as you have a backup option with John."
