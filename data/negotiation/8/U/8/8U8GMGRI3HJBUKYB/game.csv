"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but $12,000 is below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $16,000. I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $13,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $13,500, which would be $14,750. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm really stuck at $13,500.  That's the absolute highest I can go, given my budget.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $15,000. That's my minimum price, and I'm starting to think that it's time for us to part ways. However, I'm willing to make one final offer: $14,750. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",14750.0,Alice,7,
