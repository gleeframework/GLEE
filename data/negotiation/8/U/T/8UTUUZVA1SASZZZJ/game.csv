"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're providing, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm prepared to offer $1300000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
