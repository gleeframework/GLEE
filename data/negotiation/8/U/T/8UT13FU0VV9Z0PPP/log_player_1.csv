```

We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and Bob's offer is getting lower. While I'm still confident in the product's value, it's becoming evident that a mutually agreeable price might be hard to reach.  I've decided to accept John's offer of $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it ensures I secure a reasonable amount for the product and avoids further potential losses from prolonged negotiations."
