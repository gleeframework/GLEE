"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. How about we meet at $12,900? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm getting close to considering John's offer of $15,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",12900.0,Bob,4,
