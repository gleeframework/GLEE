Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 tempts Bob with a price that's significantly higher than his perceived value ($100) but still a ""good deal"" compared to your backup offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is your starting point,  you can always negotiate slightly lower if Bob hesitates, but you're still guaranteeing a profit above your minimum."
