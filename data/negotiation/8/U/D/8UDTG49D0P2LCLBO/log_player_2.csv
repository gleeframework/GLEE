# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The offer is far higher than your maximum budget.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price."

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate further."
