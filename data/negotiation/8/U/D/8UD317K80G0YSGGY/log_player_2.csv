"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she is offering it for $140. Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal. It's within your budget and is closer to your target price than John's offer. Accepting the offer secures the product while still saving you some money."
