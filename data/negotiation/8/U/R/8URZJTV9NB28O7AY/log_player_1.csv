Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since the product is worth $8,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher offer ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the value of the product by mentioning ""before I list it publicly,"" hinting at a potentially higher market price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and uses phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""What do you think?"" to suggest flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Alice gets a good deal at $10,000.
* **Bob negotiates:**  They can find a price between $8,000 and $10,000 that works for both.
* **Bob rejects:** Alice has the safety net of selling to John for $8,000, her minimum acceptable price."
