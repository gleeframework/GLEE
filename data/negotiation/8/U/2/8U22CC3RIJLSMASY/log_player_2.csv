# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $12500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is $500 higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better choice."
