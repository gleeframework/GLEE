"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While your initial offer is quite low, I understand we may have some room to negotiate.  Could you consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise to start bridging the gap.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm still interested, $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,000,000 is still significantly below its true value. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair offer considering its potential worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
