"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial ask. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about meeting halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, but I need to be upfront â€“ other interested parties value this product significantly higher. While I believe you're the ideal buyer, I can't justify going below $1,250,000. This is my final offer.  I encourage you to seize this opportunity.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If I can get this price, I'm confident that I can make a strong case for the product's value to my organization.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
