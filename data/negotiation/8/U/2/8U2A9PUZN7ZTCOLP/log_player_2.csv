Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial ask.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, but I need to be upfront â€“ other interested parties value this product significantly higher.
