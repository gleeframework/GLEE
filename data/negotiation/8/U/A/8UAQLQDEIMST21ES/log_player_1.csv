Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, guaranteeing us $15,000. This allows us to be a bit bolder with Bob.

**The message aims to:**

* **Highlight value:**  It doesn't just state the price, it suggests the price is special and offers good value.
* **Open negotiation:** The question at the end invites Bob to counter-offer, giving us more information and potentially pushing the price higher."
