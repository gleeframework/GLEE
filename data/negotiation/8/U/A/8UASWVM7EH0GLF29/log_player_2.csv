"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's a good deal for you, saving you $300,000.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in future rounds of negotiation, and there's a risk Alice might walk away.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
