"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's make this happen!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget. Let's find a compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you say?",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $91. This is a very fair price, considering my budget, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $91 isn't quite working for me.  I'm willing to come down to $91.50 as a final compromise.  It's a small difference, but it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's finalize this deal.",91.5,Alice,7,
