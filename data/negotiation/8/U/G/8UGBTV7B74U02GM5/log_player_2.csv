"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it valuable and worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  You have the option of buying from John for a much better price, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I can still buy the product from John for $8,000, which is a better deal. Therefore, I'll reject her offer and attempt to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable offering $12,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my budget of $8,000.  While she's shown a willingness to negotiate, I'm unsure if we can reach an acceptable agreement. I'm confident that John will sell me the product for $8,000, so it's a better decision to buy from him and avoid further negotiations."
