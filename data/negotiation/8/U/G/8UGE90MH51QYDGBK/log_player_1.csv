Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my research and personal valuation, I am only able to consider a price of $120 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Bob is anchored at $120 and unlikely to move significantly. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
