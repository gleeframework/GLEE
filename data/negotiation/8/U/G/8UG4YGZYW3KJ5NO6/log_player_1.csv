"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting close to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly opening helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving space for counteroffers:**  By asking for his opinion, I'm inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 10 rounds, and I want to maximize my profit. There's still time to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  
* **Potential for John:** If I can't find a better price with Bob, I have the option of selling to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate. I'm moving closer to his offer but staying above my minimum. 
* **Splitting the difference:** Offering a midpoint price often creates a sense of fairness and encourages compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $8,250 is still a good deal for him, especially if he's willing to pay $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  I can do $7,500. That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time to counter again:** I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I don't want to rush into a deal that's too low.
* **Possibility of higher offer:**  I'm hoping to get closer to $8,000 or even $9,000 before I consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down a little more to $8,000. It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a little breathing room.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but showing flexibility:**  I'm again moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm not giving in entirely. I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and accommodating tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Addressing his concerns:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, further reinforcing my willingness to compromise."
