"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate down closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  We're aiming to get the price as close to $8,000 as possible. Starting with a significantly lower offer gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating our price target. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, $8,250 is still above our ideal budget. We know we have the option to buy from John for $8,000, so we have some leverage. Let's see if we can negotiate Alice down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  I can do $7,500. That's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments to show we're willing to negotiate but also standing firm.
* **Market Value Mention:**  Subtly reminding Alice of our other options and that our offer is reasonable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will give us a better idea of Alice's bottom line and how much further we can push."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down a little more to $8,000. It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a little breathing room.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our target price! There's no point in rejecting this offer or trying to haggle further, as we've reached the best possible outcome. We get the product at the price we were aiming for."
