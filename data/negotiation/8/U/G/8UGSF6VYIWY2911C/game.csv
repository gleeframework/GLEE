"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us.  Let's discuss this further.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than that. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm confident you'll see that. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down to $850,000. However,  that's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and my budget constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to negotiate in good faith.",800000.0,Bob,4,
