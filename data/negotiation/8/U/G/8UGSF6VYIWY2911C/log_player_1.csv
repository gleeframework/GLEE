Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us.  Let's discuss this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down to $850,000. However,  that's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and my budget constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to negotiate in good faith.
