"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price just yet. While I see the value in this product, I believe a price closer to $500,000 would be more suitable for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $550,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price for both parties.",550000.0,Alice,3,
