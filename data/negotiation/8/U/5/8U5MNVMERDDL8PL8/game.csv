"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to stay within my budget. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're almost there!  $1,400,000 is a good starting point.  If you can bump it up just a little bit to $1,450,000, we can close this deal. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,7,
