"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product, worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm sure you'll find it a valuable asset.  I'm willing to sell it for $1,500,000.  This is a great price, as I have another buyer willing to pay that amount. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is for $1,500,000, which is the same price as John's, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can save no money by accepting, and rejecting and buying from John achieves the same result."
