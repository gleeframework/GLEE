"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  It's better to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating in hopes of securing a better price. I don't want to settle for less than $15,000 unless it's absolutely necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $14,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again and go with $15,125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the price, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting close to the end of the rounds. Given that John is willing to buy the product for my minimum price of $15,000, it's safer to secure this deal and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer or failing to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my target price and avoids the potential for a lower outcome."
