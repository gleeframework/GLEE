"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",875000.0,Alice,5,
