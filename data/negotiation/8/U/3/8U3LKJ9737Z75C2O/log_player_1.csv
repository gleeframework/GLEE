Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,200 just isn't quite enough for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to go up to $9,350, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $9,350 is a good price and it's getting late in the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
