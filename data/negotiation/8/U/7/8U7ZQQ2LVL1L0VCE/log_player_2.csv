Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $10,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,750 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,500.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed price of $10,000 with John."
