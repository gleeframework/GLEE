"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit for myself. I'm also being friendly and expressing confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than his initial offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the product for too low a price. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to justify my price."
