"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than my desired price. I will try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer now matches the price I can get from John. There's no point in further negotiation or risking losing the deal."
