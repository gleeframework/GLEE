Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're not selling yourself short. 
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've set the stage for a back-and-forth if Bob doesn't accept.

Remember, this is just the first offer.  You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than what John is offering, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While this is still below your desired profit margin, it's important to consider:

* **Bob's budget:**  He's clearly not willing to go higher, and you've already pushed back.
* **Selling to John:**  Accepting this offer is $1,750 more than selling to John, and you're likely not going to get a much better offer from Bob.

It's a good idea to accept this offer and move on."
