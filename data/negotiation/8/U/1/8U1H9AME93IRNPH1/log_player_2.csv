"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a great deal for Bob!  $800,000 is significantly less than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  However, there's always the possibility Alice might be willing to go even lower, so it's worth exploring further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000 from Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within a range that might be acceptable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, it's only a small improvement from Alice's initial offer.  There's still room for negotiation, and holding out could potentially lead to a lower price.  There are also a few rounds left, so it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a lower price. $750,000 is a fair middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's last one.  It's a good strategy to inch closer to her price while leaving some room for future negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay. There are still several rounds remaining, and it's worth exploring if Alice will come down further.  Bob is still in a strong negotiating position, as his maximum price is significantly higher than Alice's minimum. It's important to not rush into a deal too quickly, as there might be even better options available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal but still trying to get a good price.  $800,000 is a good compromise point between my previous offer and Alice's last one, and it's likely within her acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting close to Bob's maximum, there's still room to negotiate. It's only the 7th round, and there are still more opportunities to get a better deal.  Plus, considering Alice's willingness to compromise, there's a good chance she might be willing to meet Bob somewhere in the middle. It's better to hold out for a bit longer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount to show Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal. $850,000 is a good compromise point that's likely within Alice's acceptable range and still saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to his maximum. With only a few rounds left, it's important to get close to a deal without giving up too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John, it's still significantly higher than what Bob wants to pay. There's only one round left, and it's worth trying to get a better price.  Plus, considering the previous rounds, there's a good chance Alice might be willing to compromise further. This is a high-stakes round, but it's worth risking to potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Bob needs to make a decision.  $900,000 is a good compromise, saving Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a fair price that's likely within Alice's acceptable range, considering her previous offers. There's a good chance Alice will accept, and even if she doesn't, Bob has a backup option in John.  It's a calculated risk, but it's the best way to maximize savings in this final round."
