"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $75 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $125. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a little steep for me. Could you do $90? That would be a great price for me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise again. I can sell the product to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
