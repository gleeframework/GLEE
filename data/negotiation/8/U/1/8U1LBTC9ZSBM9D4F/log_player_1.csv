Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the value and potential of the product to Bob, making it more enticing.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I explicitly express my willingness to negotiate, signaling that I am open to finding a mutually beneficial price.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I will evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. If the negotiations don't seem promising, I will consider selling the product to John for $15,000 to avoid losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. Bob's interest in the product suggests he values it to some extent. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap between our desired prices.

**Next steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's initial offer and formulate a counteroffer that is both appealing to Bob but also meets my minimum value requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm confident this product will provide great value to you, and I'm offering it for $17,000.  This price reflects the quality and potential of the product, while also acknowledging your budget concerns. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  My counteroffer of $17,000 is a compromise between my initial price of $20,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the value and potential of the product to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Maintaining profit:**  $17,000 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, ensuring a profit for me.

**Next steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I will decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum value:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is only slightly above my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I don't believe there's enough room for further negotiation to reach a significantly higher price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is a more secure and profitable option than continuing the negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I will inform Bob that I've decided to accept John's offer and sell the product to him. This ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
