Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant savings for you. Let's find a middle ground, I'm confident we can agree on a fair price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $820,000. Can we make a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm running out of time, I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. I'm holding out hope that I can get a better deal by making one more counteroffer. It's risky, but I believe $820,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $820,000 is just not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $830,000. Can we find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob's offer of $830,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm worried we're at an impasse. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000."
