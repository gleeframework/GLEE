"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's something you've been looking for and I know it'll be a game-changer for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000.  This is a very fair price considering its value to you.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value this product at $1,000,000 to me, I'm willing to work with you.  I'm prepared to drop the price to $975,000.  This is a significant reduction, but it still allows me to profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
