"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Would you be willing to come down to $100? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
