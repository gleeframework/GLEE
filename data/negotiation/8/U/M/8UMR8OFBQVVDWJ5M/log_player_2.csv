"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value and quality, I estimate it's worth $12,000 to me. Considering its worth to you is $8,000, I propose we meet in the middle with an offer of $9,000. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a compromise, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no need to settle for a higher price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure the better deal."
