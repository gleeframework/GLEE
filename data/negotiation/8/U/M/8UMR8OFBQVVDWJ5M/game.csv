"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value and quality, I estimate it's worth $12,000 to me. Considering its worth to you is $8,000, I propose we meet in the middle with an offer of $9,000. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",9000.0,Alice,1,
