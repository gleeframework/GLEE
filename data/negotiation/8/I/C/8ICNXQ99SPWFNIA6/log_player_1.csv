Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob will have to decide if the $4,000 difference is worth it to him.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a profit of $1,000 even if Bob rejects.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might counteroffer, and you have some flexibility to work with him."
