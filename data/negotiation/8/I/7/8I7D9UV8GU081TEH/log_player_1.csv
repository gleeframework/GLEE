Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product to Bob. This helps create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counter with a new price, or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While $120 is lower than my initial offer, it's still higher than my minimum value of $100. This means I have room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.
* **Potential for higher profit:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my initial asking price of $150.

**Next steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $120, aiming to reach a compromise that is closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $135? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you get."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still higher than my minimum. This shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach an agreement quickly.
* **Focus on value:** The message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes that the price is fair. 
* **Opportunity for agreement:** By offering $135, I'm creating a scenario where Bob might be willing to accept, as it's a more attractive price than his previous offer and still within a reasonable range.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and assess his counteroffer (if he makes one) to determine my next action."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $135. How about $127.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $127.5 is still lower than my initial asking price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $100.
* **Time factor:** Continued negotiation could drag on, and I may not be able to secure a significantly higher price.

**Next steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
