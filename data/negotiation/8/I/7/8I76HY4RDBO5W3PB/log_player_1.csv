{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit and aren't immediately accepting a price below your threshold.
* **It's close enough to your minimum value:** This leaves space for further negotiation without risking a complete stalemate. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also keep in mind the potential time and effort involved in continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $1,000,000.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum value and avoids the potential for a drawn-out negotiation with Bob. However, there's also a chance Bob might increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

You'll send a counteroffer to Bob. You'll need to weigh the potential gain from negotiating further with Bob against the time and risk involved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it shows my commitment to working with you.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a move towards Bob's price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above Bob's offer:**  This still keeps the price above Bob's initial offer, indicating that you're not desperate to sell.
* **Below your minimum:**  This allows for potential negotiation while ensuring you still receive a profit.

**Next Steps:**

You've offered a compromise to Bob. Depending on his response, you can either accept his offer, counter with a new offer, or decide to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $825,000? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth the investment, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is getting closer to your minimum value, it's still below the $1,000,000 you can get from John.  The risk of continuing negotiation with Bob is that he may not increase his offer further, and you might lose the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll counter with a new offer to Bob. Aim to find a price that balances the potential profit with the risk of losing the deal to John.  You can consider a slight decrease from your previous offer to show flexibility, but be sure to remain above $825,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your need to stay within budget, but $825,000 is still a bit lower than I can reasonably accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $837,500? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get what we need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 837500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway while still keeping the price above his last offer.
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:**  It's still above your minimum value, but also less than your previous offer.
* **Demonstrating flexibility:**  This suggests you are actively trying to reach an agreement, without being too desperate.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, you can either accept his offer, counter with a new offer, or decide to sell to John for $1,000,000.  As you get closer to your minimum value, you'll need to weigh the potential loss of a higher price with the risk of a deal falling through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $815,000? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth the investment, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $815,000 is still significantly below your minimum value of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance he might increase his offer further, it's getting increasingly unlikely.  You've already made several compromises, and continuing the negotiation could lead to a lengthy process with no guarantee of a profitable outcome.

**Selling to John:**

Selling the product to John for $1,000,000 guarantees you your minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob. It's the most reliable way to secure a profitable deal and minimize potential loss."
