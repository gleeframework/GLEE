"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $200. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price!"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My maximum budget for this product is $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $200 is already a very competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I appreciate your efforts. However, I still believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My maximum budget remains at $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
 
It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge from his $100 offer.  Since I have a guaranteed offer for $150 from John, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob."
