"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I could potentially do $950,000. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This shows a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
