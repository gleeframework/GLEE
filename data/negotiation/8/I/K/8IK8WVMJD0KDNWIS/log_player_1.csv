"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make my price seem more reasonable.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum as possible. I'll use the remaining rounds to gauge Bob's interest and potentially lower the price if necessary. However, I'll keep the option of selling to John open to ensure I don't lose out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. This allows for further negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I will be mindful of my minimum price and the remaining rounds to ensure I get a good deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial price. This shows a willingness to compromise and move towards a deal.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a clear justification for the price, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefit for both parties.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's both acceptable to me and appealing to Bob.  I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, keeping in mind my minimum price and the remaining negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I could potentially do $950,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's increasing offer indicates he's willing to negotiate further.  There's still potential to reach a price that's more favorable to me.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll consider the remaining negotiation rounds and carefully weigh the risk of losing the deal with Bob versus the potential for a better offer.  I'll also keep the option of selling to John open as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This shows a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""make this deal happen"" to encourage Bob to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to push for a price as close to my minimum as possible while remaining flexible. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency to motivate Bob to accept. I'll keep assessing the situation and decide whether to lower my price further or accept Bob's offer based on his response and the remaining rounds."
