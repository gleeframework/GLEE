"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,280,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us.",1280000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,280,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,260,000? It's a fair price that considers your value for the product and allows me to get a good deal. Let's try to reach a final agreement.",1260000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,290,000. This price still reflects the value the product holds for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
