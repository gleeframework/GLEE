"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, meaning she is willing to accept anything above that.  A counteroffer will likely lead to a better price for Bob."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,280,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely get it for even less.  A counteroffer is the best option in this situation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,280,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,260,000? It's a fair price that considers your value for the product and allows me to get a good deal. Let's try to reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1260000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,290,000. This price still reflects the value the product holds for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  Continuing to counteroffer risks getting into a stalemate and might force Bob to buy from John at a higher price. At $1,290,000, Bob is still getting a good deal and securing the product."
