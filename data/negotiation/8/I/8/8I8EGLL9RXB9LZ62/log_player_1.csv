Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While getting the full $1,000,000 would be ideal, Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting the $975,000 offer avoids the risk of him walking away and still secures a substantial profit."
