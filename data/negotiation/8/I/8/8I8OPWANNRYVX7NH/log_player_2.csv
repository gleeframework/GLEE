"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob's $1,000,000 limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,150,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,150,000 is still above Bob's limit. He's already gotten a decent counteroffer in and should continue to push for a lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he doesn't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit too high. I'm happy to go to $1,100,000. Let's close this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I can do $1,120,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from your side. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to get a bit more hesitant, which could mean she's getting closer to her bottom line.  Bob is still within his budget at $1,120,000, so it's worth continuing to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll increase my offer to $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's seal this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my next move. Let me see... I can do $1,095,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet at a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,095,000 is tempting, Bob is very close to his goal of $1,000,000. With only a few rounds left, it's worth continuing to push for a lower price.  There's still a chance Alice might come down further, especially given her concerns about reaching a mutually beneficial price. If not, Bob can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,095,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make one last push, but I need to see some movement from your side. I can do $1,090,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Alice is too high.  While Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer, it's still above Bob's target of $1,000,000.  

To guarantee the purchase of the product within his budget, Bob should choose to buy from John at $1,000,000. This ensures a successful purchase and saves him $90,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
