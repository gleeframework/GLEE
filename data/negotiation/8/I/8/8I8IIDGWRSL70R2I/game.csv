"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,050,000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
