Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a strategic move to try and maximize your profits.

However, it's important to remember:

* **Bob's value is unknown:** There is a risk that Bob will reject the offer, meaning you'll only get $15,000 from John.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  If Bob is interested but thinks $20,000 is too high, you could potentially negotiate a lower price.

Ultimately, the best approach is to balance the potential for higher profits with the risk of losing a sale altogether. You can adjust the offer price based on your comfort level with risk and your assessment of Bob's potential interest."
