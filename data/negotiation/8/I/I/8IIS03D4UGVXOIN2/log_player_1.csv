Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential profit. However, I'm also leaving room for negotiation to avoid immediately pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm demonstrating flexibility to Bob while still maintaining a price that is fair to me."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. However, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm sticking to a price that's still profitable for me, but I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise. I believe this offer is reasonable and might persuade Bob to close the deal."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum and we're running out of rounds. It's a good profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for less."
