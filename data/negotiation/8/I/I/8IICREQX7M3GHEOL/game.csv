"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! However, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $110 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $90.  Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90, which would be $100. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",100.0,Alice,5,
