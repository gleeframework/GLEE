# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $150. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! However, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while still staying well below your $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still more than you want to spend, especially since you have the $100 option with John. There's room for another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $110 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $90.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

We're nudging closer to a potential deal. This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but are still holding onto a price that benefits you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90, which would be $100. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Alice has met your maximum price! There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John since you've achieved the best possible outcome."
