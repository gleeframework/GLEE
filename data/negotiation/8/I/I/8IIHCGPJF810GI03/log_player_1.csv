Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

While $1,060,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still concerned about the potential for more back and forth with Bob.  It's possible we'll never reach a price I'm comfortable with. To ensure I get the best possible outcome, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
