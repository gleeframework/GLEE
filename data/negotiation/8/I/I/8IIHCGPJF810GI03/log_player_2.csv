Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still significantly below what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1100000 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1075000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, but it's still above your ideal price point.  You're only $50,000 away from your target price with John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer."
