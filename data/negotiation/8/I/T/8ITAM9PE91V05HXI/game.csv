"Bob, I understand your position. While $900000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. I'd accept $1050000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me, and it's the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
