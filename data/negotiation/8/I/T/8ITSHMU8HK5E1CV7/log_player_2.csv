"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial price of $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product has value to Alice and shows a willingness to compromise. If Alice is serious about selling, she should be willing to consider this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than my budget of $8,000. It's not worth continuing the negotiation. I can buy the product from John for the same price that I was willing to pay to Alice in my counteroffer.  Buying from John eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Alice."
