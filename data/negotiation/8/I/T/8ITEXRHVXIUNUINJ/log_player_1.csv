{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($100) but also below the price John is willing to pay.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers and ensures I still profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $90.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $92? It's a fair price for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92. While it's still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's also a reasonable compromise that allows me to make a profit while securing a sale."
