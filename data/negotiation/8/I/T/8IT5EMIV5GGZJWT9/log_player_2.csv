"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway. In light of your offer, I am pleased to counter with a price of $975,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the original asking price, while allowing you to secure the benefits of our premium product within your financial limits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a slight decrease, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, which is within my budget.  Further negotiation with Alice could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the opportunity to purchase from John, especially since the negotiation process could be time-consuming."
