"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

$1,100,000 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000. He should continue negotiating and try to lower the price further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I have to be firm on this.  My absolute lowest price is $975,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his limit of $800,000. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000.  Further negotiation with Alice risks exceeding his budget and doesn't guarantee a successful outcome."
