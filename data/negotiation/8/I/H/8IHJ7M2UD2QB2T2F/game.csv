"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
