"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $12250, but I think I can do better than that. Let me see if I can sweeten the deal for you. I'll throw in some additional support and training worth $1000, which will bring the total value to $13250. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional support and training, but I'm not willing to pay the premium for it. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to keep costs down. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product, just for the product itself.",11000.0,Bob,6,
