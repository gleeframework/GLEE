Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but also significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This should encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing you to potentially reach a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can get more from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm increasing my price slightly from the previous offer. I'm still below Bob's perceived value, but this counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally get closer to my initial goal of $1,200,000,  $1,000,000 is a significant profit and a good compromise.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but there's also a risk Bob could walk away entirely, or I might need to accept a lower price."
