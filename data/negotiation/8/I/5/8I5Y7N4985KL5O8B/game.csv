"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which reflects the product's true worth.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial in the long run. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but considering my budget, I am only able to commit to $1000000. This aligns closely with your last offer and should allow us to reach an agreement. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
