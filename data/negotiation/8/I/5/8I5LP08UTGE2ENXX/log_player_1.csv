{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's slightly lower than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still high enough that it's a good deal for me. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more favorable agreement. I am willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. There's still room to negotiate a higher price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $1,400,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident that the product's value will exceed this price for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm sticking to a price that's closer to my desired range while still being open to negotiation. I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can still find common ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,375,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident that we can reach a price that satisfies me. To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing even more money, I'll take John's offer of $1,500,000, which is my target price."
