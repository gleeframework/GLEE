Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. At this point, it's better to go with John's guaranteed price of $800,000.  The negotiation has gone on long enough, and it's unlikely you'll get Alice to lower her price significantly further."
