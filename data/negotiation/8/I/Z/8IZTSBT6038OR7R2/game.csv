"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, considering my value for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both move forward with the deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
