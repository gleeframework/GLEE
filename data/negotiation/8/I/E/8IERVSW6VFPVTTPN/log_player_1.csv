Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Minimum:** I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000. This forms my ""safety net"" and means I shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product's worth to Bob is $8,000.  I need to offer a price that's enticing but leaves me with a profit.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $10,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Firmness:** By stating it's a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer, I project confidence and potentially discourage counter-offers.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his valuation. If I had more information, I could adjust my offer accordingly."
