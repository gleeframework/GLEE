You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since the product is worth the same to Bob from both Alice and John, there's no benefit in buying from Alice.  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob will buy from John, but at the same price.  This doesn't save Bob any money, but it also doesn't make him lose any money either."
