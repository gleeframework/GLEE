{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage and potentially reveal his valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but $100 is simply not acceptable.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $175 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $150? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to make a small profit, Bob's final offer is the same price as John's offer.  Rather than risk another counteroffer and potentially lose the sale altogether, I will sell to John for $150 to ensure I at least get my minimum desired price."
