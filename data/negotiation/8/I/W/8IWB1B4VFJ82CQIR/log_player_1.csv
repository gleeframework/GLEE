Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim high with Bob."
