Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than your initial assessment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth and presents a unique opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it below this price is leaving money on the table.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer. This approach attempts to capture the most value from Bob while still making the deal attractive to him."
