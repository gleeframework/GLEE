"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice first.  $140 is too close to your max, so let's try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $130?  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'd like to meet you at $130, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $135?  I think this is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice is getting closer to your desired price, and you're already at round 3. It's not a great deal, but it's within your budget and likely a better option than buying from John."
