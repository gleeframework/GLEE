"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Since you have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer of $9,000. You can save $1,000 by going with John."
