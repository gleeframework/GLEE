"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his ideal price. Since Bob can get the product from John for $12,000, it makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice, potentially getting a better deal or falling back to John as a last resort."
