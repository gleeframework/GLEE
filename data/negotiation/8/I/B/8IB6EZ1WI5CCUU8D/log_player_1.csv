I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but also leaves some room for negotiation with Bob. If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating, or I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000. This is still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum.  To ensure I get at least my desired value, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
