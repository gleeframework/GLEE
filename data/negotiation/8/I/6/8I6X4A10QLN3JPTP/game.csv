"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $14,000 is still more than I can justify. Could we agree on $11,500? That's a significant compromise on my end.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to my limit.  I can go up to $12,000, but that's absolutely the most I can do. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and my previous offer of $13,000, which is $12,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,7,
