"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $90 is a little higher than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and I pay $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to meet you at $86.  Let's make a deal!",86.0,Bob,4,
