"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she might reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  $135 is a good compromise and saves you $15 compared to John."
