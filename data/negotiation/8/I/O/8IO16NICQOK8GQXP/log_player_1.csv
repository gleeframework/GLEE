Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I have 8 more rounds, so I can afford to be a little more aggressive in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great price for the value of this product, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. I'd be willing to go up to $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still trying to get closer to my desired price of $10,000. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe I can push him a little further.  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal than selling to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price point.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to get closer to your desired price point, but I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and go up to $8750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to John for $8,000.  I'm also sensing that Bob is more serious about acquiring the product and may be willing to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $8750 is a step closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're still looking to get closer to your original price, but I'm not willing to go above $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider $8500 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, and Bob firmly sticking to his $8,500 offer, I'm realizing that I'm unlikely to get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I meet my minimum requirement and doesn't risk a potential loss by continuing the negotiation."
