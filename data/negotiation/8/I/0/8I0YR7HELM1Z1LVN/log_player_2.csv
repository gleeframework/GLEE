It's much better to try to negotiate with Alice. You have a significant amount of room to go lower before reaching the price of John's offer."

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  This will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially open the door for a middle ground."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $400,000 is still too high.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm raising my counteroffer to $350,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. This is also a good middle ground between my previous offer and her latest one."

Alice is showing some flexibility but is still too high.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."

I'm raising my offer to $400,000. It's closer to Alice's last offer, indicating I'm ready to compromise. However, it's still below her previous price, demonstrating that I'm not willing to simply accept her demands."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000

Alice is clearly not budging much.  While $475,000 isn't ideal, it's significantly cheaper than buying from John. It's time to accept the offer and move on."
