{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport. I'm prepared to accept a lower price, but I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to find common ground. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a substantial drop. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
