"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8750? I'm trying to make a deal, but I need to stay within my means.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $8750 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my goal.  How about $9000? That's a compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8750. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between $8750 and $9000? That would be $8875. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",8875.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $8875 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway again, at $8937.50?  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8937.5,Alice,7,

"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $8812.50? That's the best I can do, and I hope it's something you can work with.",8812.5,Bob,8,
