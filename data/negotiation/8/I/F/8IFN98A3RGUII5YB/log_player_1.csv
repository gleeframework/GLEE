"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, which may make him more willing to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. Starting with a high price allows me to negotiate down while still getting a good deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counteroffer based on his response. However, I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'll keep a close eye on the potential for a better deal with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $8,000, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell at this price yet.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going, aiming for a price closer to my target. I'll also keep John's offer in mind, as it's still a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum threshold of $10,000 but still reflects his willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my counteroffer, hoping to sway Bob. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using a positive tone and asking for Bob's opinion to keep the negotiation open and friendly.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution. By meeting Bob halfway, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin. I'll continue to monitor the possibility of selling to John if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8750? I'm trying to make a deal, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired target. I'm not ready to sell at this price yet. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold. I want to keep the negotiation going to see if I can get a better deal, while still being aware of John's offer as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my goal.  How about $9,000? That's a compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with a price that's only $250 higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize that this is a compromise to show I'm being flexible.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I use an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and keep the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

This is a calculated move. I'm trying to signal that I'm getting close to my minimum price, hoping to encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer closer to my goal. If he doesn't, I'll be prepared to reject and either make another counteroffer or sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8750. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between $8750 and $9000? That would be $8875. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,875 is closer to my desired price, it's still not meeting my minimum threshold of $10,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my target, but still below John's offer. I'm hoping to get a final counteroffer from Bob that's more favorable or, at the very least, keep the negotiation going to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $8,875 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway again, at $8,937.50?  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8937.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while staying within my minimum threshold range.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the importance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement to keep the conversation positive and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Staying Flexible:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation and further compromise, signaling that I'm still open to reaching a deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to reach a price that is acceptable to both of us.  By making a counteroffer that's a smaller increment than before, I'm hoping to push Bob toward a final agreement. If he doesn't budge, I'm still willing to accept John's offer in the next round, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $8812.50? That's the best I can do, and I hope it's something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,812.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,812.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,812.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I've had several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  

**Strategy:**

Rather than continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with a lower price, I'm choosing to take John's offer. This guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids further risk of losing out on a deal altogether."
