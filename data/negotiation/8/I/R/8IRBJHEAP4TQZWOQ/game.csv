"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This would give you a great deal on a valuable product, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
