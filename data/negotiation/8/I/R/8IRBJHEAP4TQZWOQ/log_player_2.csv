Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This would give you a great deal on a valuable product, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?
