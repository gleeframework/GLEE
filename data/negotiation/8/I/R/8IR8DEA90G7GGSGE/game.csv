"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still higher than my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, recognizing the value you place on this product. This price offers a fair compromise, allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This price is fair and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this amount.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
