Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000 to $13,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $14,500?

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
