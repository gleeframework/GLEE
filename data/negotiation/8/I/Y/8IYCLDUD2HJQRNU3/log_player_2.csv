Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  The next step is to counter-offer Alice."

Alice's offer:

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's a lower price, it's still more than what he's willing to pay and more than he can get from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $13,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and John is offering the product for $12,000, which is Bob's maximum budget."
