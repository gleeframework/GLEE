Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $850,000. This is a significant discount, and I won't go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000, especially since she mentioned another buyer. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, saving you $50,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when you have a guaranteed better deal elsewhere."
