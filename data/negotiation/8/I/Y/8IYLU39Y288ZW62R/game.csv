"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's well below what it's worth to me, and still a significant savings for you. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. While your offer is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $850,000? This price still represents a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that price?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's find a compromise. How about $840,000? It's a small step up from your offer, and it brings us closer to an agreement.  This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",840000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, and that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. Can you meet me at this price?",820000.0,Bob,6,
