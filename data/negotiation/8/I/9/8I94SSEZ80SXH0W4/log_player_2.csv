"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a lower price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still higher than Alice's perceived value. This is a strategic move to establish a starting point for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money and $11,000 is still above Alice's perceived value of the product. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price but is also showing a willingness to compromise. Offering $10,750 is a slight increase from his previous offer, signaling a desire to reach a deal. This approach demonstrates flexibility and might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $10,750.  Would you consider $10,900? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is within Bob's budget and is also closer to Alice's perceived value.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,100 compared to buying from John and represents a reasonable compromise. Further negotiation may result in a lower price, but it's likely to be minimal and not worth the risk of losing the deal."
