Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,250,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to reflect your interest and the value of the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's seal the deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting very close.  Your offer of $1,425,000 is a good step in the right direction.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $1,440,000.  This is a small difference, and I'm confident this price is fair given the value of the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,440,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,440,000

Alice's offer of $1,440,000 is a good deal, as it's still within my budget and significantly less than what I would have to pay John.  It's time to close this deal."
