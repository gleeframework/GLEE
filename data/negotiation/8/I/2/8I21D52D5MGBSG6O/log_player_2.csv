"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product.

*  Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $990,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like.

* If Alice rejects your counteroffer, you can always buy from John as a backup."
