"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let's meet in the middle at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit high. I'm feeling $90 is a fair compromise. It's closer to my budget and hopefully still works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is still a little outside of my comfort zone. Would you consider $95? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really committed to this purchase, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's worth it for a serious buyer like you.",105.0,Alice,7,
