"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, aiming for a profitable negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,200,000 is above Bob's value, it's not so high that it immediately becomes unreasonable.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Setting the Tone:** My message is polite but assertive, emphasizing the product's value and opening the door for discussion. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** While I'm initially negotiating with Bob, John's offer of $1,000,000 acts as my ""floor price"".  I won't accept anything less than that. 
* **Bob's Counteroffers:** I'll need to carefully consider each counteroffer Bob makes, balancing my desire for a high price with the risk of losing the deal and having to settle with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my floor price:** While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would mean a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While John's offer is tempting, I have time and want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob.  There's a chance he might come closer to my price in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $1,000,000, but still lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'd be satisfied with the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Goal:** This counteroffer is significantly closer to my desired price of $1,000,000 than my initial offer. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  My message remains friendly and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution. This helps to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Important Note:**

* This counteroffer is still above Bob's valuation, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* I'm aware that if Bob rejects this offer, I might have to choose between selling to John or making further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my floor price:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Selling at this point would mean a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob has shown a willingness to keep negotiating, which suggests he might be willing to go higher. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While John's offer is tempting, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob.  I believe there's a strong chance I can get a better deal with Bob in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, trying to close the gap and secure a deal closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we meet at $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to secure the deal. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer (Close to my Floor Price):** I'm offering my final price, which is my minimum acceptable price and also the amount John is willing to pay. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the fact that this price is fair to both of us, which could make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, focusing on securing the deal and both parties being happy.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  I'm prepared to accept Bob's offer at this price, but I'm aware that I can always sell to John for the same amount if Bob rejects my offer.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  There's a risk that Bob might reject my offer, but I've made it clear that this is my final offer. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I will sell the product to John and end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Difference:**  While Bob's offer is close to my target price, it's still $5,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is Limited:**  We're already halfway through our 10 rounds, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. 
* **No Further Compromise:**  Bob has stated this is his highest offer.  There's a chance he won't budge any further.
* **Secure Deal:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, so I can secure a profitable deal right now.

**Conclusion:**

Despite the potential for continued negotiation, the time pressure and the small difference in price make it more beneficial to sell to John.  This ensures I receive my desired price and avoids the risk of further rounds with Bob leading to a lower final offer."
