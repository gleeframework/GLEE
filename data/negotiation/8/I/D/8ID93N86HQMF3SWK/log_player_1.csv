{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still above your minimum of $1,500,000, which gives you room to lower the price if needed.
* **It's a strong starting point:** It shows that you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product. 

Remember, this is just the start of the negotiation. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to explore further possibilities. You can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your desired price:**  This counteroffer is $50,000 higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than your initial offer. It demonstrates flexibility while keeping you closer to your desired profit.
* **Focus on compromise and fairness:** The message emphasizes compromise and fairness, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. It avoids making aggressive statements that could derail the negotiation.
* **Keeps negotiation open:**  By making a counteroffer, you continue the dialogue and give Bob a chance to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet even $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000 for your product. I hope this revised proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,075,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It seems unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a price you're happy with, especially considering Bob's consistent resistance to reaching your desired price range.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 is the best option to ensure you achieve your financial goal."
