Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,250,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,125,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price. There's no guarantee of getting a lower price from Alice, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal. It's best to accept the offer now."
