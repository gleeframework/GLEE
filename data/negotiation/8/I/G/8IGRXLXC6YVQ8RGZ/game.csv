"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,250,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could you meet me at $1,125,000?  I feel this is a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,125,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
