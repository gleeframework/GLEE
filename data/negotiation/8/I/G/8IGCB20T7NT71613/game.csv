"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $90 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $105?  That gives us both a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $97.50? That's the best I can do.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $97.50 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $101.25?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $98.75. That's the highest I can go.",98.75,Bob,6,
