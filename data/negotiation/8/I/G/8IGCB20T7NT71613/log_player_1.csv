Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

The product is worth at least $100 to me.  Bob's offer of $90 is too low. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $90 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $105?  That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $97.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $97.50 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $101.25?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $98.75. That's the highest I can go.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  I'll sell the product to John for $100."
