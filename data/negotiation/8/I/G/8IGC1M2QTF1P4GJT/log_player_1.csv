Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you before I list it publicly. I think it would be particularly useful for you. I'm asking for $140. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Provide Justification:**  Mentioning that you're offering it to him before a public listing creates a sense of exclusivity and might encourage him to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
