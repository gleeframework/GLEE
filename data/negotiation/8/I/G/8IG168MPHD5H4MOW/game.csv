"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our valuations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
