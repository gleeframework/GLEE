Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
