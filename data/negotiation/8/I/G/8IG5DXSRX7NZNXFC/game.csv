"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $175.  This still gives me a decent margin, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
