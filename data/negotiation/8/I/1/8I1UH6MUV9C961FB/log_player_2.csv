"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's asking for $200. That's a lot higher than what it's worth to me, and definitely above my budget. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $200 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget is around $100, but that's quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you possibly do $170? That's a significant discount from my original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. $170 is close to my budget, but I can still try to negotiate for a better price. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get her to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $170 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to go to $120. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay, even with the ""meet in the middle"" offer. I've already made a couple of counteroffers and it seems like we're not going to agree on a price.  Rather than continuing this negotiation, I'm going to go with John's offer. It's a sure thing, and it's within my budget."
