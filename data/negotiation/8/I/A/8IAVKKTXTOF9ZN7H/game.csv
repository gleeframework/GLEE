"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1500000 to me. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer, so I'll counter with a price of $1300000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to me is $1500000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with a price of $1250000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to accepting your offer and selling the product to John for $1500000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1150000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no higher.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
