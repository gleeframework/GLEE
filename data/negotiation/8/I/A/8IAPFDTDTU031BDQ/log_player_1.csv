{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my desired price. It's still above my minimum, and hopefully, it will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $7,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer.  I think I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm coming down to $8,200, which is just $200 below my ideal price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John. Let's see if we can close this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, Bob seems unwilling to budge further, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. It's better to guarantee the $8,000 than to potentially end up with less."
