"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it.  This price reflects the product's high quality and potential for growth.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value we've discussed, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, and allows for a successful transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. Given the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is still fair for both of us and ensures a mutually beneficial deal. Let's work together to finalize this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this time. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,
