Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value we've discussed, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, and allows for a successful transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum of $800,000. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this time. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still lower than my ideal price, but it's above my minimum of $800,000 and closer to my desired price.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
