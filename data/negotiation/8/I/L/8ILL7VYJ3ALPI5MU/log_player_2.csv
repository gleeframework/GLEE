```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise at $11000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still outside my range. I'm firm on my offer of $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal. Let me know if you're willing to reconsider."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise at $10500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will go lower. Since you have a reliable alternative with John, who's willing to sell the product for $8,000, it's more prudent to buy from John and save $2,500."
