"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product but I can't go above $8000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12000 for the product. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise at $11000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still outside my range. I'm firm on my offer of $9500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal. Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise at $10500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
