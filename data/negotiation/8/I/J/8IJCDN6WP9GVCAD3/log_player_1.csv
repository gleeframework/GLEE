Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is higher than my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming for a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$6,000 is far too low for me. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob while still ensuring I get a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is still too low for me. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'm getting closer to John's offer, so I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000.  This is a compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that is also attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've gone back and forth with Bob a few times, and while we're getting closer, he's not willing to meet my price. I'm starting to run out of time and energy for this negotiation.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a safe bet and I can move on to other opportunities."
