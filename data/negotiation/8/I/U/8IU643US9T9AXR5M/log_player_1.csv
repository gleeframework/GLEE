"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower. While it's tempting to take the $6,500, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $9000. How about $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $7,500, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit lower. How about $7200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $8,000. We've had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems he's not willing to budge much further.  To avoid losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  It's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirement."
