"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting both the product's worth and the potential benefits it will bring to my business.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,350,000 undervalues the product's potential impact on your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This price reflects the true value and offers a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's work towards a final agreement that's advantageous for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  While $1,375,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I need to be sure this deal reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,387,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and reasonable compromise for both parties.",1387500.0,Alice,5,
