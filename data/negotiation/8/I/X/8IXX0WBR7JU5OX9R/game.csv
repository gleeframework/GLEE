"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal, I'm ready to move forward.",10200.0,Alice,5,
