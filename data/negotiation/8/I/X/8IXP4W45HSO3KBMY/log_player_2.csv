"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I would like to {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} because Alice's offer is $2,500 higher than what I'm willing to pay ($15,000 - $12,500 = $2,500). I can buy the product from John for $15,000, which is within my budget."
