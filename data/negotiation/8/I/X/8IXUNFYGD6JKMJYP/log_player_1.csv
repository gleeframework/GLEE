Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $9,000 at this time. Would you consider reducing the price to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $8,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the price of $8,500. Could you consider lowering it to $8,000? That would be greatly appreciated. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. He's willing to pay my minimum asking price of $8,000. There's no reason to continue negotiating further, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for the same price."
