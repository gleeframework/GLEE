"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $9,000 at this time. Would you consider reducing the price to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the price of $8,500. Could you consider lowering it to $8,000? That would be greatly appreciated.",8000.0,Bob,4,
