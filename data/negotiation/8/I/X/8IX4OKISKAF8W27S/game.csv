"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. For this round, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product at a price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
