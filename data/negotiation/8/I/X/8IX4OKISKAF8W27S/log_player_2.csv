"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. For this round, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and the potential for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob needs to start his counter-offer with a price that is still attractive to Alice, but closer to his target of $800,000. $850,000 represents a significant drop from Alice's offer, making it clear Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes that this price is ""fair for both of us"", hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in reaching an agreement can help build a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product at a price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** While Bob's ideal price is $800,000, Alice's offer of $875,000 is within his budget and only $75,000 over his desired price.  This is a relatively small difference considering the risk of continuing negotiations.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  There's a real risk that continuing negotiations could lead to a stalemate. Alice has already shown some flexibility, and it's possible she won't go lower.
* **Time Constraint:**  With 10 rounds, each round wasted increases the risk of ending up with no deal or being forced to buy from John at $800,000.  

**In this situation, accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures the product for a price that's still within Bob's budget.**"
