"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is closer to my budget. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk a lower offer or protracted negotiations with Bob."
