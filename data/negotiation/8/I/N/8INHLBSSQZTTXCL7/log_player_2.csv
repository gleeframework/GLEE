"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $180 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy it for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $130. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $120 as possible. While $160 is better than $180, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should reject Alice's offer and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but I'm still a little too high.  I'm happy to pay $140.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $155 is better than Alice's previous offers, it's still above Bob's target price of $120.  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob shouldn't be afraid to keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $145 is a fair price for both of us.  This is a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $150 is tempting, it's still more than Bob's target price of $120.  Since John is selling the same product for $120, it makes more sense to buy it from John.  This saves Bob $30, and ensures he gets a better deal."
