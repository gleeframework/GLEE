"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be happy to offer $9000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. What do you think?"
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise at $11000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer for now. If you're interested, let me know, or we can discuss further.",11000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9000.  It's the highest I'm willing to go at this point.",9000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll sell it to you for $10500. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?"
"I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, Bob. $10500 is my final offer. If you're not interested, I have other buyers waiting. I'd rather not waste any more time on negotiations.",10500.0,Alice,5,,
