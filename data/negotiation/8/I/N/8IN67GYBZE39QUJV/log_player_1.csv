Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe it's a steal for what it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $18,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your position, but $12,000 is still a significant way off from what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $16,000. This offer stands as a firm reflection of the product's value. "", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I can go up to $13,000, but that's really my limit. Let me know if that's doable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are moving too slowly. At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a price close to $15,000 within the remaining rounds. John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
