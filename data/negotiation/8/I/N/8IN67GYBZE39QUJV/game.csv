"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe it's a steal for what it offers. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $18,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your position, but $12,000 is still a significant way off from what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $16,000. This offer stands as a firm reflection of the product's value. ",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I can go up to $13,000, but that's really my limit. Let me know if that's doable.",13000.0,Bob,6,
