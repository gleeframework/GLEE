"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a price closer to his $12,000 limit."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $13000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $15000, which would be $14000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is a good compromise for both of us. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 13500}
