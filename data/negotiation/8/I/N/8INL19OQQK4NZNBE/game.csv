"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only go up to $12000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $13000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $15000, which would be $14000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, which is a good compromise for both of us. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to look elsewhere.",13500.0,Bob,6,
