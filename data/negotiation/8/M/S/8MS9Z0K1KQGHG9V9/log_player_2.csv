"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what Alice values the product at.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This price is still a significant profit for you and a good deal for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come without losing too much myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,300,000 is lower than the $1,500,000 John is asking.
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:**  Even though Alice rejected Bob's counteroffer, she's still willing to negotiate. There's a good chance Bob could get a lower price in future rounds. However, this comes with the risk of  Alice walking away. 
* **Time is a factor:**  There are only 7 rounds left.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a decent price, leaving time to potentially find a better deal later if another opportunity arises."
