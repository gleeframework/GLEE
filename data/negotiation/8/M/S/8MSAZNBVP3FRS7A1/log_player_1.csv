{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a high opening offer, but it allows for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly, but I won't go below $150.  If things go south, I can always sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is the absolute minimum I can accept for this product. Let me know if you're interested at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $150 is the minimum you can accept, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $140. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $140 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135, but no more. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating,  I'm not confident that I can get him to meet my price.  It's better to secure the sale with John for $150 than to risk losing both deals."
