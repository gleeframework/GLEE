Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Range:** There's a potential $300,000 difference you can negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position. 

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're presenting a take-it-or-leave-it offer rather than inviting immediate negotiation. This projects confidence in your price.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 gives Bob a $100,000 discount on his perceived value, making it attractive. It also secures you a $200,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:** While brief, you hint at the value proposition without revealing specifics that could weaken your position.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiation style, you could start higher or lower."
