"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  This is a good deal for both of us - it's a good profit for you and a fair price for me.  Let's make this happen!",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $750,000. How about $800,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
