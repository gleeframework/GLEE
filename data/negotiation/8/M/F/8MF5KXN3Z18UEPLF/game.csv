"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000.  This still allows for a good deal for you, while also ensuring a fair price for me.  I believe this is a mutually beneficial compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
