Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is far too low. Considering the value to you and the potential benefits, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $600,000 is simply not enough. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my original asking price and leaves room for further negotiation.  I believe it's a fair price that allows you to secure the product while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
