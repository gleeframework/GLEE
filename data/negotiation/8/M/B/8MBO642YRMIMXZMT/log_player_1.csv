Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it leaves you with a good margin to make a profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's still above Bob's valuation, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the discount compared to my valuation to make the offer seem more attractive.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to create a collaborative atmosphere. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate, or if it's time to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to secure a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's room for me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.  
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob.

**Next Step:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and still give you a great deal.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my negotiating position.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product and the fairness of the offer to Bob. 
* **Reasonable Profit:**  I emphasize the need to make a ""reasonable profit"" to further justify the price.
* **Next Step:**  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.  If he rejects, I'll need to decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if it's time to move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. It allows you to recoup a significant portion of the product's value and lets me secure a better price than I could get elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has a high risk of either ending up with a lower price or going through multiple rounds with no guarantee of success.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that meets my minimum.  

**Next Step:**

* **Sell to John:**  This is the most sensible choice, as it guarantees the highest price and eliminates further negotiation."
