"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it leaves you with a good margin to make a profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  He knows John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, so he has a clear target to aim for."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and still give you a great deal.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget and can potentially get a better deal.  He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to that."

It allows you to recoup a significant portion of the product's value and lets me secure a better price than I could get elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
