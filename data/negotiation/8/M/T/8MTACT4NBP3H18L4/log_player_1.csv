Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $110 is above Bob's valuation of $80, but below your minimum of $120, giving room for both of you to come to a compromise. 
* **Shows confidence:** Offering a price close to your minimum demonstrates that you believe in the value of your product.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep Bob engaged and potentially open to a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway by splitting the difference between his offer ($90) and my previous offer ($110). 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes understanding Bob's budget while still highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Moving Closer:** By lowering the price slightly, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking for a deal, so I'm willing to offer $92. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is a slight improvement over Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum of $120.  At this point, I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price closer to my desired range.  

Selling to John for $120 guarantees my minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might ultimately lead to a lower price."
