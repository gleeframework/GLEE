"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to proceed with your backup plan, saving you $150,000."
