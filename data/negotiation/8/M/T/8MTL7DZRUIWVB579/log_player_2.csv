"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $18,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price. 
* **John is a backup option:** If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John for your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $14,000 is still outside of my comfortable range. 
* **Negotiation continues:** There are still 7 rounds left to try and get a better price.
* **John remains a backup:** I can still get the product for $10,000 from John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my maximum:**  $13,500 is just $3,500 more than my budget.  
* **Only 5 rounds left:** I'm not sure I can get a much lower price with limited rounds. 
* **Saving money over John:** This offer is still significantly cheaper than buying from John for $10,000. 

While I'd love to get the product for closer to my ideal price, I believe accepting this offer is the most strategic move at this point."
