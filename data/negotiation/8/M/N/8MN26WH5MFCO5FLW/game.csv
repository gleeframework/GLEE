"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,750. Let me know if that's something you're comfortable with!",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. Let's see if we can close this deal with a little bit of compromise on both sides.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,125. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us!",9125.0,Bob,6,
