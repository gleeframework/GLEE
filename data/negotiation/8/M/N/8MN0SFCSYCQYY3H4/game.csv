"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a high price for it, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1050000. How about we meet in the middle at $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's see if we can meet at $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1075000. How about we meet at $1050000, like I suggested earlier? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1075000 again, but this time I'll throw in a small bonus that's worth $25000. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1100000 to me. How about we meet at $950000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to offer you a deal that's as close to my target as I'm willing to go: $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one last concession. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're willing to accept this offer, I'll make the deal.",980000.0,Bob,10,
