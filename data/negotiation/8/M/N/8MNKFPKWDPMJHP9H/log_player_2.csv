Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's fair to start our negotiation at $7500. This is an excellent opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to counter your offer at $7200. This price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While he was hoping for $7,000, $7,200 is still a significant saving compared to the $8,000 from John. It's a reasonable compromise and Bob should accept to avoid further negotiation rounds and the risk of Alice walking away from the deal."
