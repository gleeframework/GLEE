"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
