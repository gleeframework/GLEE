"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",999000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $999000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000. This is a fair price considering I have another offer for $1200000, but I really do prefer this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $999000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $920000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value and your interest in it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850000. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to find a good deal, and I am still very interested in purchasing this unique product.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $850000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $880000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",880000.0,Alice,5,
