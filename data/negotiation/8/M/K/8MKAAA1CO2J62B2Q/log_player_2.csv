"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product that is worth $1500000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your maximum value:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000
