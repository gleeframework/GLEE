Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a sense of a good deal, potentially motivating him to accept. 
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:** This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It sets a clear starting point:**  This helps structure the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go as low as I initially suggested, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my desired price, it's only $750 less than my initial offer and above my minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.  Given the time and effort involved in negotiations, it makes sense to accept this offer and move on."
