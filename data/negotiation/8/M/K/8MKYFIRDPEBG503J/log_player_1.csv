{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential compromise while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum.  By offering a price that's significantly higher than your minimum, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better deal.  If he rejects, you can then adjust your offer based on his counteroffer or go with John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is a decent profit, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to try and get closer to our initial asking price.  We can use this opportunity to understand Bob's budget limitations better and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $16000 is a better offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to our desired price point. Accepting this offer would ensure a good profit for us, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a good compromise and allows us to move forward without waiting further."
