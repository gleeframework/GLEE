Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $1,100,000 given its potential value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob:

* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially leading to a final price higher than John's offer.
* **High Initial Offer Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer can anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making him more receptive to a price higher than your backup offer.

**Important Note:**  This is just one potential strategy.  A more aggressive approach might involve an even higher initial offer. A more cautious approach might start closer to $1,000,000.  The optimal strategy depends on your risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's negotiating style."
