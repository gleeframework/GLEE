Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $900,000, you're still getting more than Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially negotiate down from this price if Bob is willing to counter.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to deal:** This offer shows Bob you're serious about selling to him, but also that you're not desperate.

 **Important:**  Keep in mind that John is always a backup option at $1,000,000. So, you don't have to accept a price lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below your minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **You have leverage:**  You know John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so you have a strong fallback position.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to push him closer to your price point with a counteroffer.

**Next Step:** You will need to send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to show you my commitment to this deal. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain your position:** You are still above your minimum price of $1,000,000 but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Show flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates that you are willing to compromise.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** There is still space to negotiate further, which can be helpful if Bob is genuinely interested.

Remember: You can always go back to John if this negotiation fails."
