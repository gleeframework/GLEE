"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and while I value it significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my own valuation, and I believe it's a fair offer given the product's potential benefits to your company.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Even though Alice is offering a ""discount,"" $1,200,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the product for a much better price from John."
