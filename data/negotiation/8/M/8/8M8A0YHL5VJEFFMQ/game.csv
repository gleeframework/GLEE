,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $13,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product for $13,625.  This is my final offer, and it's a good price considering the value you'll get from the product.",13625.0,Alice,7,
