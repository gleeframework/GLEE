Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum price point, which is the same price as John's offer.  Since John's offer is guaranteed, it's best to take it and avoid further negotiation with Alice.  Continuing with Alice could result in further counteroffers and potentially a deal that is worse than John's."
