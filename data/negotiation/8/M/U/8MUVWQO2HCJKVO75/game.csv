"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and importance, I am proposing a price of $12000 for it. This reflects not only its worth but also the opportunity it presents to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $8500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value of the product and the market conditions, I am unable to accept $8500 at this time. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a middle ground at $9500? I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit above my budget at $9500. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
