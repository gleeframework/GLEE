"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm getting closer to your price, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1050000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think $1080000 is a fair price for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
