Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I'd prefer to get it for my original counteroffer of $1,050,000, $1,080,000 is a good deal considering my maximum budget and the value of the product.  It's time to close the deal before she changes her mind or I run out of time."
