"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would significantly enhance your business or personal endeavors. This item holds immense value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am willing to consider a transaction. Given its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers, I propose to sell it to you for $950000. This price reflects a fair compromise between its true value and my desire to ensure a profitable outcome for both parties involved. I trust this offer will be favorable to you, allowing you to maximize the investment while also ensuring a satisfactory return for me. Please let me know if you require any further information or clarification about the product, and we can proceed with the details of the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $950,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price is significant."
