,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers, so how about $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle from my previous offer. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,7,
