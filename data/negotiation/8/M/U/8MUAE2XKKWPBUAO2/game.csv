"Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and my proposal aims to bridge the gap between its true worth and your budget. I am offering this exceptional product to you at a special price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its full value, while still allowing me to recover a substantial portion of its worth. I believe this offer presents a fair compromise that respects the value you see in the product and ensures a profitable transaction for me. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Best regards, Alice",1200000.0,Alice,1,
