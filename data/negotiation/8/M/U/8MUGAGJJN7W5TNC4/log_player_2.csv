"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special introductory price of $20,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Round 2

{""message"": ""That's a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still too high. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,000? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's getting closer to his target price, but he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's also very close to his ""walk-away"" price with John, so he has leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice.  $16,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to go to $15,500.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $16,000, which is $15,750. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is not willing to go lower than $15,750, which is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While this is a good deal for Bob, he can get the product for his target price with John.  The risk of further negotiation with Alice is not worth saving a small amount of money."
