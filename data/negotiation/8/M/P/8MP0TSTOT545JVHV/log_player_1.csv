Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,700,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take it, I'm going to reject it and counter with a higher price in the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it shows Bob I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price. I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
