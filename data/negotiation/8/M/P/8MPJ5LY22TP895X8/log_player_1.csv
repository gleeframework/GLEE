Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, considering its potential. I'm asking for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's a chance he'll be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While your initial offer is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you have a strong backup offer from John."
