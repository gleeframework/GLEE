"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe holds significant value. Given its quality and features, we feel it's worth more than what the market typically commands. Considering its worth to us and its potential value to you, I propose to sell it to you for $95. This price not only ensures a fair deal for both parties but also allows me to maintain a competitive edge in the market. I look forward to your positive response.",95.0,Alice,1,
