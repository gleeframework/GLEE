{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he'd theoretically be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price of $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit margin above your minimum. It aims to capture a large portion of the value difference ($200,000) between your minimum and Bob's maximum.

**The message is crafted to be:**

* **Direct:**  Clearly states the offer.
* **Value-Oriented:**  Highlights the product's worth.
* **Confident:** Implies that this is a strong offer based on a fair assessment."
