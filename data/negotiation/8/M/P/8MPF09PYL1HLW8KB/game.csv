"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, given my own assessment of its worth. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential value for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging your assessment of its worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  This price acknowledges the value you see in the product, while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,5,
