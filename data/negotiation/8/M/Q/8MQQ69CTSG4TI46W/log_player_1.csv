Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to start with this offer.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are escalating too slowly.  It's clear we have different perceptions of the product's value. Accepting his current offer would mean losing a substantial amount compared to John's guaranteed offer."
