"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This takes into account the value it offers and leaves a reasonable margin for negotiation.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
