Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if it's significantly higher than his valuation, it can influence his perception of a ""good deal"" later in the process.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to get even more from Bob. By starting high, I preserve the option to significantly lower the price if needed while still exceeding John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:** $900,000 is far less than my $1,200,000 minimum and even further from my initial asking price. Accepting would be a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a large gap between our positions, indicating room for negotiation. By rejecting, I signal that his offer is unacceptable and encourage him to move closer to my valuation.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This takes into account the value it offers and leaves a reasonable margin for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** I lowered my price by $150,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I remain well above my $1,200,000 minimum and closer to my initial offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the higher price (""market value"") to anchor the negotiation and make Bob justify further low offers.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Bob's seriousness. If he's unwilling to budge much from $900,000, it might be more worthwhile to proceed with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds My Minimum and John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my $1,200,000 minimum and even surpasses what John is offering.
* **""Highest He Can Go"":** Bob explicitly stated this is his best offer.  Pushing further could lead to him walking away, and I'd risk losing the extra $100,000 he's offering over John's deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation further has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids potential delays or complications."
