"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9250. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $9250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $8750.  This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8750 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $9000, which is just $150 above my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and go with $8875.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8875 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $8900, which is just $25 above my minimum price. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,7,
