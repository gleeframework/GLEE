"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $15000.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",15000.0,Bob,2,,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your effort in finding common ground. I understand you need a fair price, and I want to make sure I'm getting a good deal. However, $17000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $16000.  Let's see if we can close this deal at that price.",16000.0,Bob,6,,
