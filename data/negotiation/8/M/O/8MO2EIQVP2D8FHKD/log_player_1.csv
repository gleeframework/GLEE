Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000 (her safety net with John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim to capture as much of that potential profit as possible without pushing Bob away.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, allowing you to benefit significantly from its acquisition."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Strong Starting Point:** It's significantly above Alice's minimum, demonstrating seriousness while leaving room for negotiation (if needed).
* **Appeals to Bob:**  It offers Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value, making it an attractive proposition.
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While leaving room for Alice to potentially go slightly lower, it avoids appearing desperate.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice has insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or more collaborative), she can slightly adjust her approach.
* **Relationship Building:**  The message is professional and positive, aiming to foster a good business relationship even if Bob counters.
