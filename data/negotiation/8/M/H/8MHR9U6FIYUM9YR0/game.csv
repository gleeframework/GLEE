"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks Alice, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a little outside my comfort zone. Let's split the difference again. How about $13,000? ",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really eager to finalize this deal, but I'm still stuck at $13,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product. Would you reconsider my offer?",13000.0,Bob,6,
