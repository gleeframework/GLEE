# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has immense value for you, given your potential to leverage it. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This represents a significant value proposition for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.
