"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within a lower budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been able to find a similar product elsewhere for $100, which is within my budget. I'm wondering if you might consider matching that price or coming closer to $100 for this product? Thank you for understanding.",100.0,Bob,4,
