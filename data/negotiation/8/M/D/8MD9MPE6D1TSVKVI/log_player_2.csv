"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so she is making a profit of $2,000 by selling it to me for $14,000. I can get the product for cheaper from John for $15,000, which is still within my budget of $15,000. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
