Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but not so high as to be immediately rejected.  This gives room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to emphasize the product's worth. 
* **Open Ended:** I'm not forcing a yes/no answer immediately, allowing for potential counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still keeping the negotiation open.
* I'll need to be flexible and willing to adjust my price based on Bob's responses. 
* I'll also be mindful of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John as a backup."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's above his estimated value, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.** I believe there's room to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Sell to John is a backup.** I'm aware of the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, but I'm not ready to abandon the negotiation with Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value but still within a range that Bob might consider. 
* I'll need to be careful not to alienate Bob completely, as he's still my best shot at a higher price than John's offer."

```

**Explanation:**

```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway (almost):** I'm lowering my price again, showing flexibility, but still staying above my minimum threshold. This counteroffer represents a significant discount from my initial price while staying within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to highlight that I'm trying to be reasonable.
* **Call to Action:** I'm adding a call to action (""Let's close this deal..."") to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a ""sweet spot"" where I can secure a price that's close to my target while still being acceptable to Bob.
*  With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to be more assertive in closing the deal, but not push too hard to avoid a stalemate.
* I'll keep a close eye on Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly, always considering the option of selling to John as a backup."

**Strategy:**
