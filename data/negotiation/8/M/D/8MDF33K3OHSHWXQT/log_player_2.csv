"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $950,000. It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a good price for me, but it gives Alice room to come up a bit if she wants to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, and $925,000 is a good price considering John is selling for $1,000,000. It's a good deal for me, and it's worth accepting rather than risking another round of negotiation."
