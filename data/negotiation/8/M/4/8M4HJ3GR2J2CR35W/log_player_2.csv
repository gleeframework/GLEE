"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice is asking for $11,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  You'll only buy from John if you can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your desired price, you can still try to get a lower price.
* **You have more negotiation rounds.** It's worth trying to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John. 
* **There's a chance Alice might come down further.** By rejecting the offer and counteroffering again, you might push Alice closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10600}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still think the product is worth more than $10,600. I'm willing to meet you at $10,700. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering the product for $10,700. This is a good deal for you.
* **Alice has stated this is her final offer.**  There's a risk that if you reject this offer, Alice might walk away, and you'll have to buy from John at a higher price.
* **You've already saved money.** You've successfully negotiated a lower price than Alice's initial offer, so accepting this offer is a win."
