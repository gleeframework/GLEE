"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very attractive:**  $500,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance you can negotiate a lower price with Alice. 
* **No risk in rejecting:** Rejecting the offer doesn't hurt you. You can always buy from John as a fallback option.

By rejecting the offer, you open the opportunity to see if Alice is willing to go lower and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and get an understanding of her bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it provides a starting point for future negotiations, and I can always increase my offer slightly in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:** Alice's new offer of $400,000 is still a substantial savings compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.
* **Limited Upside:**  While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, it's unlikely Alice will drop much lower.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I continue to reject offers, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and withdraw the product from sale, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price.

Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a significantly lower price than my maximum budget, minimizing risk and maximizing savings."
