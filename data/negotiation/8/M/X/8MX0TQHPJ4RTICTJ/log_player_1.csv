Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always good to start with a price that's above your minimum to give yourself room to negotiate.  
* **Being friendly:** A friendly message makes the negotiation feel less adversarial.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  $100 leaves room for Bob to make a lower counteroffer.  If he's really interested, he'll likely start with a lower counteroffer, giving you room to negotiate down. 
* **Always having an alternative:**  Remember, John is there to buy the product for $80, so you're not under pressure to sell it to Bob for less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $80.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is your minimum acceptable price.  
* **No reason to risk it:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and you could end up with a lower price or having to sell to John. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Accepting Bob's offer avoids further rounds of negotiation and saves time."
