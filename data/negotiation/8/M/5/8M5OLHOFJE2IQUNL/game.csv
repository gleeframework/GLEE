"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given our negotiation so far and my budget.  Let's try to reach a deal this round.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to pay $950,000, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer you a price of $1,050,000 is still too high for you, so I'll come down to $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your initial asking price and my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on $950,000, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer you a price of $1,000,000 is out of the question, so I'll come down to $1,000,000 - $50,000 = $950,000 is still no go, so I'll come down another $50,000 to $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $975,000, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $962,500 for the product. This is a fair price given our negotiation and the value we both see in the product. Let's close this deal now. ",962500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm not willing to go below $975,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the $962,500 offer.
