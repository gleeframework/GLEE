"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is far above my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's too risky to accept this offer.  It's better to counteroffer and see if I can negotiate a better price.  If not, I can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer close to my maximum budget, but still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows good faith in negotiating while still leaving room for further bargaining.  I'm also highlighting my budget constraint to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  While it's a compromise, I'm still willing to push for a lower price.  There are still rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  If we don't, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given our negotiation so far and my budget.  Let's try to reach a deal this round."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again, but still staying within my budget.  I'm hoping this shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating a fair price, and that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  I'm also highlighting the fact that this is my final offer before I consider going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to pay $950,000, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer you a price of $1,050,000 is still too high for you, so I'll come down to $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer of $1,025,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I have a few more rounds left and I want to see if we can get closer to my target price. If I reject this offer, I have the option of counteroffering again, or going with John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your initial asking price and my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $950,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's offer but within my budget.  I'm emphasizing that I'm ready to close the deal at this price, hoping to put pressure on Alice to accept. This is my final offer before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $950,000, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer you a price of $1,000,000 is out of the question, so I'll come down to $1,000,000 - $50,000 = $950,000 is still no go, so I'll come down another $50,000 to $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $975,000, it's still a bit higher than my budget and my last offer.  I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal. I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, and I want to see if Alice will budge any further.  I'm still prepared to go with John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $975,000, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $962,500 for the product. This is a fair price given our negotiation and the value we both see in the product. Let's close this deal now. "", ""product_price"": 962500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Alice's current offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. This leaves very little room for further negotiation, putting pressure on Alice to accept. If she rejects this offer, I'll move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm not willing to go below $975,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the $962,500 offer. I'll offer you a price of $968,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $968,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $968,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's final offer of $968,750 is closer to my budget than previous offers, it's still a bit higher than my preferred price.  With only one round left, the risk of rejecting and getting a counteroffer that's worse is too high.  It's better to go with John and get the product for $800,000, which is within my budget and ensures I get the product without further negotiation."
