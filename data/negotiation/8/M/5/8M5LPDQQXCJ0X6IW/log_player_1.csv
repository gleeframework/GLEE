Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also need to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $120, so we need to offer it at a price that provides him value but is still significantly below our minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't go below $150.

By offering the product at $140, we create a win-win situation where Bob gets the product for $20 less than his perceived value, and we make a profit above our minimum."
