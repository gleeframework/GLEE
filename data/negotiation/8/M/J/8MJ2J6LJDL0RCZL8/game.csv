"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is also eager to purchase it.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
