"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its unique value and potential. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market demand.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $920000 is closer, it's still a little below my desired price point. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $935000. This would represent a fair compromise and ensure a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that with this price, you'll find this product to be a valuable investment.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $935000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $915000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Bob,6,
