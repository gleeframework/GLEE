Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $12000. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $16500. It's a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
