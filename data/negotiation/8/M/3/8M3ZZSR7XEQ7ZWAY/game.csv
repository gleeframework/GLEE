,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $10000.  Let's make this work!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9500. Let's see if we can make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still a little low for me. Let's compromise at $10500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10500 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9800 is still a bit too low for me.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $10200. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's close this deal!",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go above $9800. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and I'll meet you at $9900. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",9900.0,Bob,8,
