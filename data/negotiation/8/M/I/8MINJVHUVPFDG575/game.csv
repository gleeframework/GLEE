"While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to make an offer of $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to buy the product from John for $15,000 if we can't reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
