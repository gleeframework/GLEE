"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for a price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the significant value it holds for you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000.  This still represents a significant gain for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it would allow both of us to walk away with a good outcome.  Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, which would be $1,262,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",1262500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While your offer of $1,262,500 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,270,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it would allow both of us to walk away with a good outcome.  Let's close this deal.",1270000.0,Alice,7,
