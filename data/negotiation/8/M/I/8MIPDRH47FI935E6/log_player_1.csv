{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also a psychologically appealing number - a round figure that seems more ""official"" than a lower one. 

I'm hoping Bob will counter with a lower offer, allowing us to reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I have no risk in making a bold opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth sacrificing the potential for a more profitable deal.  

I will counter with a price closer to my original offer.  I am confident I can secure a price closer to my target value, especially given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for a significantly lower price. $1,100,000 is still a fair price for Bob, and it's closer to my target value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to stay close to your initial offer, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my target value, it's still a significant amount of money I would be leaving on the table. I'm confident that I can still get a better price, especially given that John is willing to pay $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to work with him. It's also a psychologically appealing number, ending in 500, which might make it seem more concrete than a round number. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm confident I can sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not taking a big risk by sticking with this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $1080000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my target value. While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
