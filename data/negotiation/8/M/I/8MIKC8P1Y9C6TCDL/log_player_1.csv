{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100).** This ensures you get a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($120).** This makes the offer attractive to Bob.

By offering $115, you leave room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob towards a counteroffer. You also show a willingness to negotiate, making the deal more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is your minimum acceptable price, you can still potentially earn more. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $105. This allows me to still cover my costs and leaves a bit of room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to keep my spending lower. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is persistent in trying to get the product for $100. While you could continue to counteroffer, it's likely the negotiations will continue to be lengthy and there's a good chance he'll reject your next offer. You've already reached your minimum acceptable price, and John is offering to buy the product for that price.  Selling to John now guarantees you get your minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
