"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $105. This allows me to still cover my costs and leaves a bit of room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
