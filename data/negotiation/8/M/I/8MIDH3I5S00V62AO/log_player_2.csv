**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.** Even though Alice's offer is more than her value of the product ($1,200,000), it's still lower than the $1,500,000 Bob would pay John.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.** By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $150,000 compared to buying from John."
