Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, as it aligns with my budget and the value I see in this item. Let me know if you're open to this price.

I believe this price reflects the value of the product and aligns with my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.
