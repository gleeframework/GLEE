{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to buy the product for $800,000, so he's going to start with his maximum price.  This also establishes his budget clearly to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  He's better off rejecting and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his budget but also wants to show he's willing to compromise.  A counteroffer of $950,000 is a good midpoint between his maximum and Alice's last offer.  This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also has a firm price in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, as this is within his budget and avoids further negotiations."
