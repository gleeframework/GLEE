Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,400,000, reflecting its true worth.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit with Bob:**  While John offers $1,500,000, aiming slightly below that with Bob ($1,400,000) attempts to maximize potential profit.
* **Understand Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Bob provides negotiation leverage. The offer is significantly higher than his perceived value but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal if he values certain aspects you've highlighted.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates urgency and might incentivize Bob to act quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a strong chance of a successful sale."
