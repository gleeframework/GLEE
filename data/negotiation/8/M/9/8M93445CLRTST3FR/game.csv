"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of 100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of 95. This is as low as I can go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $95 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet at $92.  I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",92.0,Bob,6,
