"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is my maximum, there's no harm in seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  By rejecting the offer, I can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a quick discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also establishes a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good compromise.  It's likely I won't get a better deal, so accepting this offer is the best choice to save money and secure the product."
