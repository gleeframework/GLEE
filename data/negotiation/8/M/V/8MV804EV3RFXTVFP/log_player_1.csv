Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

I'm offering $14,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility but still keeping a profit margin.  I hope this will encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14300}

I'm offering $14,300. It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price. I'm hoping this shows him I'm serious about making a deal and encourages him to accept."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,100.

While I'd love to get more, the deal is getting close to my minimum value, and with limited rounds left, it's better to close the deal and secure a profit. I'll accept Bob's offer of $14,100."
