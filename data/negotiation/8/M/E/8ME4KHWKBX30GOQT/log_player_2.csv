"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and her offer is $15,000. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation.  I'm offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum value ($10,000) to incentivize her to continue negotiating. This strategy aims to find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and is a good deal compared to buying from John. I can save $1,000 by accepting this offer.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and then potentially increasing her price makes this a good opportunity to secure the product at a reasonable price."
