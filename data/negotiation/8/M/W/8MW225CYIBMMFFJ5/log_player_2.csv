"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $10000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer gives Bob the chance to try and get closer to his target price of $8,000.  Since John is willing to sell for that price, Bob has a fallback option if negotiations with Alice break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is closer to your offer but still within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I need to stay above $10000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $10200? It's a fair compromise, and a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  By rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer, Bob can continue to try and negotiate a better price.  Since John is willing to sell for $8,000, Bob has a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer but I need to stay closer to my budget.  How about $9,800?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $9800 just isn't enough for me. To be honest, I'm getting close to selling to someone else for a much higher price.  However, I'm willing to do one final compromise. How about $10000?  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to Bob's target of $8,000, but it's still not ideal. Bob has already rejected several offers from Alice and is running out of time.  Additionally, Alice mentions that she's close to selling to someone else for a higher price, implying that she's not very motivated to negotiate further. 

Considering these factors, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures he gets the product at his desired price, avoids potentially getting stuck with a higher price from Alice, and guarantees the deal is closed."
