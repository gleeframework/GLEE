"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's initial offer. It's still too high, and there's room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a good strategy to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  The price is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still not a great deal for Bob. He can likely push for a lower price. There are still plenty of rounds left to negotiate.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is still worse than waiting to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a calculated risk. If Alice accepts, Bob gets a great deal. If she rejects, Bob can continue to negotiate but risks running out of rounds.  

However, the risk is mitigated by the fact that Bob knows John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, providing a safety net in case negotiations with Alice fall apart."
