"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out!",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $82.50. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $82.50. I can offer you the product for $86. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",86.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $86 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $83, but no more. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $83?",83.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $83 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I can offer you the product for $84.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",84.5,Alice,5,
