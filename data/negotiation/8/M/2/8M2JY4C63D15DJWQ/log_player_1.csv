Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I am too.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still not quite there.  I'd be happy to offer $1,050,000.  This reflects a compromise that allows for a healthy profit for both of us.  What do you think?
