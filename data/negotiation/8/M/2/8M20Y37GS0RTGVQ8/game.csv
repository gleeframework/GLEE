"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but $9500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $11200. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, but I'm not willing to go below $11000. I'll meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $10500. This is my final offer on this price point.",10500.0,Alice,7,
