"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  To be honest, $925,000 is still a bigger investment than I had in mind. I could potentially stretch my budget to $725,000, but that's really my limit.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued discussion. I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is  below what I can accept. Let's settle this right now: how about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This demonstrates how serious I am about finding a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to offer $775,000.  This is a very strong offer, and I need to be realistic about my budget.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I respect your position and I'm motivated to close this deal. My final offer is $815,000. This is a very small margin for me, but I value finding an agreement with you.",815000.0,Alice,7,
