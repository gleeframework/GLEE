{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $900,000.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to pay Alice's full asking price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come down further in price."

**Explanation:**

Alice is still too high, and the negotiation doesn't seem to be making significant progress.  It's better to cut my losses and buy from John. While I would prefer to save more, I'm still getting a good deal at $800,000."
