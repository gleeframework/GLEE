"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. To kick off our negotiation, I propose a starting price of $2,250,000.  What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my ability to make a purchase. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While I'm open to negotiating, $1,750,000 is a significant gap from my initial ask.  To move things forward, I propose a revised price of $2,000,000. This reflects a substantial reduction on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still outside my price range.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm prepared to offer $1,850,000 for the product, which represents a fair compromise and demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring it. I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",1850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm eager to finalize this deal, and I believe we're getting closer. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,925,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair agreement for both of us.",1925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. While $1,925,000 is closer to my target, it's still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,875,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1875000.0,Bob,6,
