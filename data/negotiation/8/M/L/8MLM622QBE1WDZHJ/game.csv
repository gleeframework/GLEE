"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly unique and I can't let it go for less than $1,100,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and provide significant returns on your investment.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, Alice, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
