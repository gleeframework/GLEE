"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for this unique item. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1100000. This is a fair price considering I'm very close to walking away and buying from John. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're close to walking away, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is my minimum price. If you're really interested in the product, I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1200000 is still a bit outside of my budget. If you were willing to come down to $1150000, I'd be happy to finalize this deal. I understand this is my final offer, and if you are not able to accept it, I will need to proceed with purchasing from John.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
