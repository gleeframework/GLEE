"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable product at a discounted rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He's aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the strategic choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good compromise. Bob is looking to save as much money as possible, but $875,000 is still a significant discount from the original price of $950,000, and from the price John would charge ($1,000,000).  Accepting this offer is a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
