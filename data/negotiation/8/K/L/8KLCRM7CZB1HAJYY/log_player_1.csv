Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer shows we understand the product's value and creates room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly reminds Bob that we have a backup plan, adding a sense of urgency. 
* **Time Pressure (optional):** While not included in this message, adding a time limit could encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this price. He might counter-offer, or reject it outright. However, this strategy gives us the best chance of maximizing our profit while still ensuring we don't sell for less than our guaranteed amount from John."
