``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, or potentially exploring other options if possible.  Rejecting the offer keeps you open to further negotiation or finding a better deal."
