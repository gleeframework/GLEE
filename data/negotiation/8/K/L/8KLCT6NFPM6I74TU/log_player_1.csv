Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value ($15,000). I have 9 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can either get closer to my desired price with Bob or sell to John for my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this product. Let's find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're still willing to negotiate, Alice. Thank you for coming down in price. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is an improvement on Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. With 6 rounds remaining, I'm not desperate to accept an offer below my minimum value. There's still a chance that I can get a better price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still not close enough to what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and its potential for you.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a final price of $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer based on my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping for. With 4 rounds remaining, I still have time to push for a better price with Bob. If I don't get closer to my desired price, I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the time we've both invested in this negotiation. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice, but I'm unable to meet your latest offer. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This is my last offer within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my desired price.  While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm concerned that I won't be able to secure a better price in the next round. Given that I can sell to John for $15,000, it's a more secure option with a higher return.  I'll take the guaranteed profit."
