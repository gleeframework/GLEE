"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $120. Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  $140 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $150? That's my absolute bottom line, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,5,
