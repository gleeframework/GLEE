"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $180 is way above his maximum budget of $120. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $120. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $160 is closer to his budget, it's still too high. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still outside my price range. How about $140?  That's a significant step closer to my budget and hopefully a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $140 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $150? That's my absolute bottom line, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $120. Alice's offer of $150 is still above Bob's maximum budget. Since Bob has already negotiated with Alice for several rounds and there are only 5 rounds left, it is unlikely that Alice will drop the price further.  It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John."
