Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and potential demand, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your hand. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a compromise.

**Goal:**  The aim is to either:

1. **Secure a Deal Above $10,000:** Ideally, Bob sees the value and agrees to a price higher than your minimum.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** If Bob firmly rejects the offer, it gives you information about his price sensitivity. You can then decide whether to negotiate further or move on to John."
