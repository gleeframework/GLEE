"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $95 for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is the lowest I can go without losing money. It's still a good deal for you, and we can close this deal now.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to give you one last offer: $102. It's not much more than your last offer, but it's the closest I can come.  If you're serious about buying this, let's make a deal. ",102.0,Alice,7,
