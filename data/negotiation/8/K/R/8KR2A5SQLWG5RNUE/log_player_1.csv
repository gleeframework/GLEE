{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is higher than Bob's $10,000, so there's potential for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $11,500 is still above your $12,000 minimum, so you're not losing money.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By starting a bit higher, you signal flexibility and create room for Bob to counter.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the deal and avoid further negotiation, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you do $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $11,500, I think this is a good compromise. It's a fair price and ensures a sale.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
