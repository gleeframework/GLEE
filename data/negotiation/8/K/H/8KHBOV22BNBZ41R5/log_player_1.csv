Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135. This is a bit above the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers. I'm confident John will buy for $120 if needed, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $110 is significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is a compromise, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I could continue negotiating, I'm confident John will buy the product for $120. It's not the highest price, but it's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum requirement."
