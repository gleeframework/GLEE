Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting at $135, which is a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chance of Bob accepting.
* **Potential Counteroffers:** If Bob rejects my initial offer, I anticipate a counteroffer around $120. I will be prepared to reject this offer, as it's below my minimum. I'll then counter with a price close to $130, hoping to reach a compromise.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 provides a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob drag on or become unproductive, I can always move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's counteroffer of $110 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Rejection:**  I need to reject this offer to protect my interests. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Next Round:** I will counter with a price closer to $125, aiming to find a middle ground while still remaining above my minimum. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'm aware that John is a backup option at $150, so I have some leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $125 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our positions.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $125 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Having John as a backup at $150 still provides some leverage.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can either counter again or move to John."
