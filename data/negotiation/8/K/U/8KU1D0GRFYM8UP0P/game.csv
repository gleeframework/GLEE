"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $870,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",870000.0,Bob,4,
