"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still significantly below Bob's perceived value. Let's negotiate further."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $870,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000.
