Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $7,500, which is the same as my previous offer. If we can't meet at this price, I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has gone back up to her previous offer of $7,500 and is signaling she won't go much lower.  It's unlikely we'll get a deal significantly better than John's offer of $8,000.  It makes more sense to cut our losses and buy from John to guarantee the product."
