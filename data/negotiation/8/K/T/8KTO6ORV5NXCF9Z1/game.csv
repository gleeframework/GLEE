"Alice, your initial offer is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $1200000 for it.  This is my top offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this opportunity.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your top offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $1200000. I'm ready to close the deal at this price. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1500000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
