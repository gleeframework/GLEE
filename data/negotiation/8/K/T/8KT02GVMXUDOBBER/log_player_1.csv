Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.** This ensures you're making a good profit.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000).** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By setting a clear initial price and communicating the value proposition, you lay the groundwork for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $1,200,000 and the product's value to him.  By rejecting his offer, you show that you're not willing to settle for a price that's too low and that you believe the product is worth more. This sets the stage for further negotiation and potentially a higher final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While it's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer balances the following:

* **Compromise:** You've come down from your initial offer of $1,200,000, showing flexibility.
* **Value Preservation:** You're still seeking a price above $900,000, ensuring you get closer to the product's true worth.
* **Fairness:** You're presenting the $1,000,000 price as a ""fair compromise"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

By focusing on a middle ground and emphasizing fairness, you increase the chances of Bob accepting your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and it's a good outcome considering the potential for continued negotiation and the risk of Bob rejecting future offers.  Accepting his offer will ensure a quick and profitable transaction."
