"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10750.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a price that's reasonable for you as well.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10500. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $10500 is tempting, I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product. Let's compromise at $10600. It's a small step for you, but a big one for me, and will bring us closer to a deal.",10600.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your effort in coming down to $10600, Alice. I've been considering the value of the product and my budget carefully. I would like to propose a price of $10400. I hope this proposal helps us move forward towards a fair transaction.",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling we're very close to a deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, $10400 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10500. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've thought about our previous discussions and decided to adjust my proposal to $10450. I hope this price point will be acceptable for you while staying within my budget.",10450.0,Bob,8,
