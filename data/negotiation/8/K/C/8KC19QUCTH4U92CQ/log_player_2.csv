# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While the offer is lower than John's,  Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that 10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do 10800 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's lower than what John is offering and closer to Bob's target price of $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might go lower, but it's a risk that isn't worth taking given the potential for a stalemate and Bob's ability to still purchase from John as a backup."
