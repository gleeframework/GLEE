{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $900,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer takes into account a few things:

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving you significant room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:**  You're safe knowing you have John as a backup who will buy it for $800,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, moving the final price closer to his $1,000,000 valuation. 

The message is framed as an ""exclusive opportunity"" to add a touch of appeal and urgency."
