Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price, I want to start with a significantly higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond my minimum.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth a premium. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By asking for Bob's thoughts, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate and hear his perspective.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still maintaining a professional and potentially agreeable tone with Bob."
