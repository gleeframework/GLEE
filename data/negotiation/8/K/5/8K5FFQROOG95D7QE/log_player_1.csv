"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting that the product is ""fantastic"" to potentially make Bob feel like it's worth the price.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I'm setting the stage for a successful negotiation.  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but always keeping in mind my minimum price of $150.  I'll also be watching for any signs that Bob is close to accepting, and I'll be prepared to lower my price slightly if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I still want to leave room for negotiation but need to be more firm in my pricing. I'll also be mindful of the 10 rounds and consider if it's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob or if I should just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  That's a good price for a product like this, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to accept a price that's too low.
* **Highlight the Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying it's ""a good price for a product like this."" This helps to justify the price.
* **Maintain a Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and positive.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. I'm confident that $140 is a fair price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I'm still mindful of the 10 rounds and will keep the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum of $150, but it's getting closer.  Since we're already halfway through the rounds, I'm going to accept his offer.  

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting $130 is better than getting nothing or potentially losing out to John.  I'm confident I can still make a reasonable profit, and I'm willing to take this deal to avoid further negotiation."
