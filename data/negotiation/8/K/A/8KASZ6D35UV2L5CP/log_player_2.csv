"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product valuation, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John at $1,000,000 saves you $100,000, which is the best use of your resources."
