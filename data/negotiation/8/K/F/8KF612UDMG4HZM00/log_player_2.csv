"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be polite and show continued interest:**  We want to maintain a positive negotiation.
* **Establish a lower starting point:**  Offering significantly less than Alice's asking price gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good deal.
* **Remain below our maximum budget:**  $70 leaves space to negotiate upwards if needed, but still stays under our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting in the middle at $82 is a reasonable compromise. It allows us to acquire the product for less than our $100 maximum and significantly less than John's offer.  Further negotiation might not yield a much better result and could risk losing the deal."
