Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to consider his offer, it's crucial to hold my ground and maintain my profit margin.  I'll proceed to the next round and counter with a more reasonable price."
