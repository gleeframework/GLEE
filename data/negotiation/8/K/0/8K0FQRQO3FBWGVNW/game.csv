"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's try $88.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $88 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again.  How about $90? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
