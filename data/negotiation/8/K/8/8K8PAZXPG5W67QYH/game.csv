"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you sharing the details. However, $180 is a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but $80 is quite a lowball offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $140. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my budget is strict. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'll counteroffer at $130. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with your budget constraints.",130.0,Alice,5,
