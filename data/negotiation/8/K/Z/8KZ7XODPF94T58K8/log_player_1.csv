Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  I think it's a great value for you, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's above your minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's accompanied by a friendly message:**  This helps to build rapport and make Bob feel like you're willing to work with him.
* **It explicitly invites negotiation:** This shows Bob that you're open to finding a price that works for both of you. 

Keep in mind that the best offer depends on how much you think the product is worth to Bob. If you think it's worth more to him than $18,000, you might start higher. If you're not sure, this offer is a safe starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is a decent amount, it's still below your minimum price of $12,000.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000, it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price.  This keeps the negotiation going and hopefully gets Bob closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a price that I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You're willing to lower your price, but not too much.
* **Reiterates the value:** You remind Bob that the product is a ""great deal"" at this price.
* **Maintains a positive tone:** You keep the conversation friendly and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, but it's still below your target. You have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000, so it's worth pushing for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and hopefully get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. I can't quite go down to $12,500, but I'm happy to meet you at $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll get great value out of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Bob's budget:** You show you're listening and willing to compromise.
* **Offers a small concession:** You lower your price slightly, but still maintain a good profit margin.
* **Emphasizes value:** You remind Bob of the product's worth and how this price is still a good deal.

By being flexible and persuasive, you can hopefully get Bob to accept this counteroffer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet in the middle. How about $12500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, it's likely that Bob won't budge further.  He's already offered his maximum price, and you've already lowered your price significantly. While $12,500 is close to your minimum price, it's still less than what John is offering.  Selling to John guarantees you a safe and reasonable profit. It's a better choice than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a deal falling through."
