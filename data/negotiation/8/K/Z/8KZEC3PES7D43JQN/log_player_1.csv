"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested. It's important to start high to see if we can get a good deal right away, while leaving room to adjust the price as the negotiation goes on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's close to my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my ideal. This strategy keeps the negotiation going and hopefully moves us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but we've already had three rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement that's more beneficial to me.  It's time to secure the deal with John for $8,000.  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal."
