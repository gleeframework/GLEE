"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $12,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
