"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, so I'm aiming for a bit more.  I'm also leaving myself some room to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $9,500. It's still a bit higher than what he offered, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully makes him feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 that I'm willing to accept it. It's still a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of having to negotiate further with Bob or potentially selling to John for the same amount."
