Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000.

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $175,000 less than John's price and $175,000 less than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Alice is Firm:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further might lead to her walking away. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are now relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal with Alice."
