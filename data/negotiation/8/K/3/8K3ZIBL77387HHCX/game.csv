"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000.
