"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a little high, but $10,000 is too low for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to work something out.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I want to make this work. However, the value of this product is significant, and $12,000 is still too low.  Would you be willing to consider $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still too high for me.  I'm really pushing my budget, but I can go up to $13,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,7,
