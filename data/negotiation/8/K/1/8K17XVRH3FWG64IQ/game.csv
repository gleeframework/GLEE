"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $2,300,000 is significantly below the product's true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet somewhere in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000? I believe this price point reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,500,000?
