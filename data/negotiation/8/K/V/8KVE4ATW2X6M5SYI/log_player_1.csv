Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good price. I'm also being upfront and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000 before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above your price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

I'm reducing the price by $150,000 from my previous offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob to accept."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate the reduction, but I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. This might be closer to what you're looking for while also fitting within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
