"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he's too far off from my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair to me. I believe Bob will be willing to compromise to close this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm starting to worry that he won't budge much further.  I'm not comfortable selling for that price, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
