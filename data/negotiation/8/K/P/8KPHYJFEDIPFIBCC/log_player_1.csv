I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping that he will be willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him. This is a good outcome, as it allows me to earn significantly more than selling to John."
