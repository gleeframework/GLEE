Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to pay more.  I'm also leaving some room to negotiate if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140, which is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his perceived value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still want to get as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I've already spent time negotiating and I don't want to risk Bob continuing to lower the price.  John offers a guaranteed price of $150, so it's the better choice at this point."
