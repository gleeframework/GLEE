"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to make the price seem more palatable.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that maximizes my profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'll use the next few rounds to gauge his interest and adjust my offers accordingly. If the negotiations stall, I'll be ready to move on to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $10500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Even though it's a bit above his initial perceived value, it doesn't come close to covering my costs.
* **Negotiation is Key:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and shows that I'm serious about achieving a fair deal.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price that is still above Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.  I'll try to find a middle ground while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  It's a fair compromise that gives us both some room for a deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($10,500). This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm using language like ""fair compromise"" and ""room for a deal"" to make the price seem reasonable and mutually beneficial.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $11,250 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not giving away too much.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to test Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price.  If he accepts, I've secured a decent deal. If he rejects, I'll need to consider my options in the next round, including potentially moving on to John if the negotiation doesn't progress."
