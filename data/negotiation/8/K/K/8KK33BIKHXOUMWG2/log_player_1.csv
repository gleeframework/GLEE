Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher price.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you might have been able to go higher! If he rejects, you can always lower the price slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage. You don't *have* to go below that price."
