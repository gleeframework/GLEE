"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,250,000?  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence in finding a solution. While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 for this final offer. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
