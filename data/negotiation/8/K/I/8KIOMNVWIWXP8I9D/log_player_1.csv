Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While it's higher than what I'll ultimately accept, it creates room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits,"" I'm framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrases ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal my willingness to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm secure knowing John will purchase the product at my minimum acceptable price. This allows me to be firm in negotiations with Bob.

**Objective:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below $1,500,000 as I have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
