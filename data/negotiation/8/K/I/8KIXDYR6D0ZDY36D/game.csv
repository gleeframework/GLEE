"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we try $112? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $112. How about we try $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we try $115? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. How about we try $110 again? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for.",110.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $116. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $116. How about we try $113? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",113.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $113. How about we try $114?
