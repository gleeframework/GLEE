"Alice, $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
