"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1200000, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1250000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
