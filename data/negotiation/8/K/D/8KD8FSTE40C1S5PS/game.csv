"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me, and allows you a significant profit margin. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This gives you a good deal and allows me to move forward.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
