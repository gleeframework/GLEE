"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than its actual price tag. Given its high quality and unique features, I think it's fair to suggest a price of $100 for you. Considering its value to you, this seems like a great opportunity to acquire something truly special without breaking the bank. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120 maximum.
* Alice is offering it for $100.
* You can get it from John for $120, which is your limit.

Since you can get it from John at your limit, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
