"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $145? I think that's a fair price for a product in great condition like this one.",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $145 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's a good price considering the condition of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $155? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
