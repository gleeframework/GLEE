{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate but still leaves you with a decent profit.
* **Below your minimum:**  You're still comfortable with this price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob doesn't accept. 
* **Reasonable:** It shows good faith and is likely to start a productive conversation.

Remember, you can always change your offer later based on Bob's response."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can secure it for a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I am still aiming for a higher price. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am still interested in purchasing the product for $12,500. This price aligns more closely with what I am willing to spend. Let me know if this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low, and I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for a better price. It's time to move on and secure the higher value deal with John."
