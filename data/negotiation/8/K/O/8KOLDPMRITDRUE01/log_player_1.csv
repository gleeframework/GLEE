"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to continue. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is low:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than my target.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. 
* **John's offer is the safety net:**  I'm confident I can get a better price than $9,000, but I have John's $15,000 offer as a backup plan. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference at $10,500? This price still gives you a great deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive language:**  I'm using positive language and highlighting the benefits for both of us.
* **Maintaining target:**  $10,500 is still closer to my target value than Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to him. 
* **Maintaining John as an option:** I'm still aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  While $9,750 is closer to my target, it's still not at the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  The negotiation is progressing, and I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm confident I can get a better price than $9,750, but I have John's $15,000 offer as a backup plan.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,750. To make this work for me, I'd need to come down to $10,000. This would still be a fantastic deal for you and allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  I'm offering another compromise, meeting halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm reinforcing the value of the product for Bob while highlighting the benefit of the offer to me. 
* **Maintaining target:**  $10,000 is closer to my target and still provides a good deal for Bob, considering its value to him. 
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:**  While I'm pushing to close a deal with Bob, John's $15,000 offer is still a good backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10,000. How about we meet at $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  While $9,500 is getting closer to my target, it's still not at the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  The negotiation is progressing, and I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm confident I can get a better price than $9,500, but I have John's $15,000 offer as a backup plan.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  To be honest, $9,500 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference one last time at $9,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9875} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise, meeting halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This emphasizes that I'm genuinely trying to find common ground.
* **Urgency and finality:** The message conveys a sense of urgency, suggesting this could be the last offer. This may incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language, highlighting the value to Bob and emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Close to my target:** $9,875 is closer to my desired value, but it's also a relatively significant increase from Bob's last offer. 
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:**  While I'm nearing my minimum, John's $15,000 offer is still a solid backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $9,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but no higher. I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has refused to budge from his price of $9,500, and I'm unwilling to go below $9,875.  We've reached a stalemate. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds left, there isn't enough time for further negotiation, especially since I've already offered several compromises. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly higher than what I can get from Bob at this point.  

Selling to John guarantees me a much higher profit than selling to Bob, even though I'm ultimately not achieving my desired price."
