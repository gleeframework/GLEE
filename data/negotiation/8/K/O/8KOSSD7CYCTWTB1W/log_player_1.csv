"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum desired price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering with $135. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is the highest offer so far, and it's above my minimum desired price of $100. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is a good compromise, ensuring I make a profit and avoiding the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
