It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer gives you a chance to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within my budget. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still giving me a good chance of getting a lower price."

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above my maximum. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. Hopefully, she'll accept this offer and we can finalize the transaction."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum, and it's likely that we'll continue going back and forth. Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's better to end the negotiation with Alice and buy the product from John."
