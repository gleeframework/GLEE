Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet at $1,100,000?  This gives you a good price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,050,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, though. How about we settle at $1,150,000?
