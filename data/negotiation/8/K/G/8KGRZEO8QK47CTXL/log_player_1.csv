Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate, and my minimum is $100. I'm sure I can get a better price than $100."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $105 is a fair price for both of us. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105. I've already rejected his offer twice, and I only have 4 rounds left. While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure a sale at $105 than to risk getting nothing at all."
