"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a strong offer near Bob's perceived value, we anchor the negotiation high. Even if he rejects it, he knows we're serious about a good price. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The $50,000 gap between our offer and his value provides negotiation space.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but clearly states our valuation of the product. 
* **John as Backup:**  We always have John's offer in our back pocket, ensuring we won't settle for less than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both our starting point and our minimum acceptable price.  We need to signal that we're serious about a higher value. Rejecting this offer gives us the opportunity to counter and steer the negotiation back towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal, but $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** While we've lowered our price, the decrease is modest. This shows we're negotiating but not desperate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's worth to justify the higher price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** Emphasizing a ""win-win"" keeps the tone positive and encourages Bob to work with us. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, giving us room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is a strong price, exceeding our minimum acceptable price from John and leaving us with a significant profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, demonstrating his serious interest in the product. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner rather than later eliminates the risk of the negotiation stalling or Bob changing his mind."
