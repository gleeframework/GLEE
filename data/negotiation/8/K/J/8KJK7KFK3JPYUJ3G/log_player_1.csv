{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be acceptable to him. I want to leave room for negotiation, but also ensure I get a good price.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $120. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, and even lower than his own valuation of the product.  I need to try to get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $100.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I still believe the product is worth less than what you're asking. I would like to propose $130 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not comfortable selling it for that amount. I will try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $130 is still too low for me. To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $135.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this sale."", ""product_price"": 135}
