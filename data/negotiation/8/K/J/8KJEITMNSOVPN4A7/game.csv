"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is a great fit for me, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $950,000?  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $935,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $935,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $960,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,6,
