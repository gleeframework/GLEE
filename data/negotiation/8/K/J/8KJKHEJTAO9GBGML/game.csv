"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer, as I already have other interested buyers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,750,000 is close, but to make this work, I would need $1,900,000. This is a significant investment for you, I understand, so I want to be sure we're both comfortable with the final agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
