Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still more than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should counteroffer and see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice has come down to $10,000, that's still more than Bob is willing to pay. John offers a price that's within Bob's budget, making it the best option."
