"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
