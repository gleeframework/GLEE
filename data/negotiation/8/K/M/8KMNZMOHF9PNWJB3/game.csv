"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $115?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not sure how much more I'm willing to budge. If you're really interested in the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $116?",116.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $114. Would you be willing to meet me at $114.50? I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I don't want to go too far above my budget.",114.5,Bob,8,
