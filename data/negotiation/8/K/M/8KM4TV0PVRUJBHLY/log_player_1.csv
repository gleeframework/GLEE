"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This initial offer will give me a sense of Bob's interest level and help gauge his potential value for the product."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is better than my minimum, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit. This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better.  The product is worth more than this to me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get as close to $1 million as possible. The product is worth more to me than this, and I'm confident that I can get a better offer by continuing to negotiate. I'm not ready to accept his offer yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm making a small concession, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. This offer signals my willingness to compromise, but also shows that I am not desperate to sell. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to finally make a significant move towards my desired price."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $975,000 is a tempting offer, it's not quite enough to meet my goal. I'm running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer significantly in the next round.  It's time to take the safe option and sell to John for $1,000,000. This will guarantee me my minimum profit and prevent any potential risks of further negotiation."
