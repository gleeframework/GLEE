You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  A counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if necessary. This counteroffer should start a more serious negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's price.  A counteroffer of $1,300,000 shows that he's willing to compromise but still wants a better deal than $1,350,000.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob wants to save even more money, Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is only $20,000 more than his last counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John for a higher price."
