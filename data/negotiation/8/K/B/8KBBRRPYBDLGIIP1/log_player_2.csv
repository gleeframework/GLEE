**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings. Alice has come down considerably, and while $1,015,000 is above our target, it's a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to push risks a stalemate, and ultimately, we'd lose the potential savings by going with John."
