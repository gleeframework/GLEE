"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $1,000 difference between my price and Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation and compromise. 
* **Creating urgency:** My message implies that this is a great deal for Bob, suggesting that he might not get this opportunity again. 
* **Checking for interest:** I'm keeping the negotiation open by asking for his thoughts, allowing him to either accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I have 10 rounds, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:**  While John is willing to pay my minimum price, I could potentially get more from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a reasonable decrease:** I'm dropping the price by $1,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Highlighing the value for Bob:** I reiterate the value he places on the product, making it clear that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Open to compromise:** My message ends with an invitation for further negotiation, showing that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer than his previous offers, it's not enough for me to sell.
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** We are still in the early rounds of the negotiation, and I'm confident that with continued back-and-forth, I can potentially achieve a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Selling to John is premature:**  While John is willing to pay my minimum price, I could potentially get a higher price from Bob by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that we're getting closer.  While $12,500 is tempting, I need to be at $13,500 to make this work. It's a small difference, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise, but still profitable:** I'm only decreasing the price by $500, showing a willingness to be flexible while staying above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** I highlight that this is a fair deal for both of us,  making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the deal:** I use a more assertive tone to push for a final agreement, hoping to close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $12,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell at this price yet.
* **Negotiation room:** We've reached the halfway point of the negotiation, and I believe there's still room to improve the offer through continued back-and-forth. 
* **John is still a backup:**  While John is willing to pay my minimum price, I could potentially get a higher price from Bob by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you pushing the price up, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,150. This is a great deal for both of us, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm suggesting a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value for both:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both of us. 
* **Strong closing statement:** I'm using a more assertive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Running out of time:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation, with only two rounds remaining.
* **Little room for improvement:**  Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum price, and there's limited potential for significant price increases in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, which is a safe and profitable option compared to risking further negotiation. 

While I would ideally prefer to get a higher price, selling to John ensures a certain profit and eliminates the risk of ending up with a lower price than desired."
