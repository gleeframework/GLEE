Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $600,000 is too far below my value for this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This offer is still a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the product's potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to close the deal and avoid selling to John,  $700,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but  $700,000  simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will bring significant value to your business. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
