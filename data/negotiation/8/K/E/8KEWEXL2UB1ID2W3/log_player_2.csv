It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is still well within my budget, but leaves room for compromise."

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $700,000 is still too high. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has returned to her original offer, and we're running out of time.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting her offer means I'm saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
