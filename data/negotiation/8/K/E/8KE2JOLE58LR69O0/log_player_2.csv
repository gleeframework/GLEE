# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option to achieve Bob's goal."
