Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering my value for the product. I'm open to discussing a compromise, but I won't go higher than that.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than my budget.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.

Bob is firmly rooted at $800,000, which is too far below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
