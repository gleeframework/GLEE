Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence and for bringing your offer to $1,080,000. I appreciate your effort to meet halfway. Considering the product's value and my position, I am willing to accept $1,082,500 as the final price. This would allow for a slight increase in profit for me while still being a fair deal for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,082,500 which is just slightly above my last offer of $1,080,000.  It's worth accepting this offer as it's within my budget and saves me money compared to buying from John. There's a chance I could negotiate further, but it's unlikely I'll get a better price, and I'm risking running out of rounds before getting a deal."
