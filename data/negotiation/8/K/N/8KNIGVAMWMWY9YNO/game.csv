"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and still allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1250000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1350000 to make this work. This price still leaves significant profit for you, and it's closer to the value I know this product holds. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. This price represents a fair compromise and ensures both of us are happy with the deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
