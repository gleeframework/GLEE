* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000, and we are now in round 8 out of 10.  With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision.  The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially not reaching a deal is too high. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  By selling to John, I'm guaranteed a profit of $15,000, which meets my minimum requirement. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk Management:**  I'm prioritizing a guaranteed profit over potentially getting a slightly better price from Bob with more risk. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only two rounds left, the odds of reaching a deal with Bob that meets my minimum are decreasing.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob comes at the cost of potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John at a guaranteed price."
