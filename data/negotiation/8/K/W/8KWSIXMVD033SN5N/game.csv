"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That seems fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
