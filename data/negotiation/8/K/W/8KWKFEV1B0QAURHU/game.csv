"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $112? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value and the price I'm willing to pay.",112.0,Bob,4,
