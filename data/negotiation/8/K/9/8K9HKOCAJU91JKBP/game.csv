"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal and I think you'll really like it.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a good price for a product of this quality. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, maybe around $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to drop my price to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference and settle at $90? That's a price I'm comfortable with.",90.0,Bob,6,
