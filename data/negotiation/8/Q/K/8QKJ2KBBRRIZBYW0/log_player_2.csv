Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $775,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.
