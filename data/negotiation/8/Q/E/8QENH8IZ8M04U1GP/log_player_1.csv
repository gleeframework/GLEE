Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my desired price.  I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go above that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, as there are still rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $125000. I'm willing to take a small risk and go slightly below the middle point, but I'm not willing to go above $125000. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a very low offer from Bob. It is clear he doesn't understand the value of the product.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Even though this is a lower price than my desired amount, it is still a better option than accepting Bob's extremely low offer."
