"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** $950,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer leads to a higher price:** Buying from John would cost Bob $1,200,000.

Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer to save $250,000."
