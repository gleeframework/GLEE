,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1100000 for it, as this is the maximum I can pay at this time.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1100000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1300000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to go up to $1250000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
