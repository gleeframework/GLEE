"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $980,000? That's the best I can do at this point.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $980,000 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
