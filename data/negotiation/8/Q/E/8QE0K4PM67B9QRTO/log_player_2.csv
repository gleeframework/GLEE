"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  Bob can always buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

Reasoning: Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within his budget and leaves room for negotiation.  He's acknowledging the product's value but trying to get a lower starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's offer is closer to his target, he can likely get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation. He's not in a hurry and has the option of buying from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another option.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

Reasoning: Bob is getting closer to his target price. He's making a slightly higher counteroffer to show he's serious about buying from Alice, but also stating his final offer to pressure her into making a decision.  He's also reminding her that he has an alternative option (John), which increases the pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $8100. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point. Bob has already made his final offer and knows he can buy the product from John for $12,000. Accepting Alice's offer means saving $3,900 compared to buying from John.  This is a good deal for Bob considering the limited rounds left."
