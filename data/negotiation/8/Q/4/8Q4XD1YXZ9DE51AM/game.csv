"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",925000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This recognizes the value it brings while still representing a good deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $750,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Can we discuss a price of $775,000? I'm confident that this is a fair price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While I understand your position, the product's value to me is significantly higher.  To be fair to us both, I can't go below $825,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $775,000. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1,000,000.",775000.0,Bob,6,
