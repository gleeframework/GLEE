Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed sale at that price from John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't rationally pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum valuation. 

**The Optimal Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the given valuations, you have two main options:

1. **Aim for the ""Best Possible"" with Bob:** Offer the product at a price slightly above Bob's valuation. This is a risky move as it heavily relies on Bob potentially misjudging the product's worth to him or being influenced by negotiation tactics.

2. **Proceed with John:** Accept that Bob is not a viable buyer at your desired price point and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000.

**The Offer (Option 1 - Risky)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its potential and value in the market, I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Markup:**  The price is slightly above Bob's valuation, hoping he might see additional value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The message creates a sense of urgency and implies competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **High Risk:** This strategy carries a high risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  Successfully getting Bob to pay above his perceived value would require strong negotiation skills.

**Recommendation:**

While the provided offer is an option, the safest and most logical approach is to proceed with selling the product to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
