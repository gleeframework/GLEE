"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its potential and value in the market, I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save money."
