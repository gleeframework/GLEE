"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, but one that still allows room for negotiation and keeps me well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice came down in price, and $125 is a reasonable deal. It's close to her value, and I'm saving $25 compared to John's offer."
