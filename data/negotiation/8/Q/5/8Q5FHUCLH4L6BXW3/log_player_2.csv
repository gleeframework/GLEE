# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,001. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is below your maximum budget ($1,500,000).**  This means you're getting a deal.
* **Alice's offer is above her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).** This means she's willing to make a profit, which makes the deal more likely to go through.
* **Buying from John would be more expensive.**  Even though you're saving a tiny amount compared to your budget, it's still more expensive than Alice's offer."
