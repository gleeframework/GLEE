"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle? Would $110 work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $110 is still a bit much for my budget. Could we try something around $70? I think that would be a fair price.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works, but I need to be honest, $70 is just too far off for me.  I'm willing to let it go for $95, but that's my absolute best offer.  I do have another interested buyer, so please let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I may need to move on.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I could do $80, and I'm ready to buy right now at that price.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,6,
