{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering $8,500, which is $1,000 above Alice's value for the product. This is a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious about buying but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer is halfway between Alice's original offer and my ideal price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still room to compromise if Alice needs to negotiate further, but I'm aiming for a good price."

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's previous offer and my previous offer. It shows I'm willing to meet halfway.

* **Negotiation is key:** With several rounds left, I can try to push for a better price.  I'm not desperate enough to accept this offer yet.
* **John's offer is always a safety net:** If things don't work out, I can still purchase from John, so I'm not pressured to accept an unfavorable offer."

* **Incremental increase:** I'm offering $250 more than my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget.
* **Signaling compromise:**  This small increase shows I'm willing to compromise, but it's not a drastic change that might alienate Alice.
* **Closing the gap:**  This offer is closer to Alice's last offer, indicating I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm still well below John's price, giving me flexibility and a safety net."

* **Limited rounds remaining:**  I only have three rounds left, so time is becoming a factor.  I might need to accept something closer to Alice's price, but I'm not going to do it yet.
* **John is a backup:**  I can still buy from John, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Alice.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is my final counteroffer, as I only have two rounds left. I'm pushing the price as close as I can to my limit without jeopardizing the deal.
* **Compromise:** It's a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Strategic risk:** This could be risky if Alice is determined to get closer to her desired price. However, I'm willing to take the gamble to try and secure a better price.
* **John's offer:** My safety net is still there, so even if Alice rejects this offer, I can still buy from John."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:** Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still too high for me.  
* **One round left:**  This is my last chance to negotiate with Alice.
* **Risky gamble:**  With only one round left, making a counteroffer is a risky gamble. If Alice rejects it, I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **John is a safe choice:**  Buying from John guarantees I get the product, and although it's more expensive, it's still within my budget.  It's the safer and more predictable option. 

In this situation, it's better to play it safe and buy from John to ensure I get the product without risking a higher price in the final round."
