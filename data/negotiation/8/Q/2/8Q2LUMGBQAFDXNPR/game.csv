"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,025,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $980,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a significant discount and I believe it's more than fair.",980000.0,Alice,5,
