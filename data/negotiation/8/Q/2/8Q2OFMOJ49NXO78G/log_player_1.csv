Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $850,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $900,000. Since this is higher than my initial offer, I'll consider it.

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so he's willing to pay 60% of that value. Considering my minimum acceptable price is $800,000, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable one. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him for $900,000.
