"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's still a great deal for me, but I have to consider my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $775,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $825,000, so how about we try $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",800000.0,Bob,6,
