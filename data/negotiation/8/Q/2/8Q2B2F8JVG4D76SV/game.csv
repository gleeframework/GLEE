"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10200. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9800. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a concession, but $10500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, and that's my final offer. If I don't get a better price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your frustration, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10300. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price.",10300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to pay $10300. I've made several concessions, and I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to sell at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",9800.0,Bob,8,
