"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's target of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise.  It's a great price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $1,075,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,000,000.
* **A small compromise:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer is only $75,000 more than Bob's target.  It's a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will become unwilling to sell or that Bob might lose the product to another buyer. Accepting the offer guarantees the purchase at a reasonable price."
