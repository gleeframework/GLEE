Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to maximize profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, starting higher gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** The message vaguely hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This might make Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 price tag leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob negotiates down, you can still likely secure a price higher than your $15,000 guarantee.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Motivation:** This strategy assumes Bob values the product enough to potentially pay above market value ($10,000). 
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can always decrease your asking price, but avoid going below your $15,000 safety net (unless you're willing to take a loss)."
