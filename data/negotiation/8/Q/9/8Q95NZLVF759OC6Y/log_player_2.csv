"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
While Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. You can try a counteroffer significantly lower than $11,500 to see if Alice is willing to go down."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.

Alice is moving closer to her value, but we're still a good bit away from your ideal price. There's room to negotiate further and see if she'll come down more."
