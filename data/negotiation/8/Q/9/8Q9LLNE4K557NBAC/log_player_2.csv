# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $125. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to save some money. Alice's offer is $25 more than what I'm willing to pay, so I'll reject her offer. I'll see if I can get it from John for $100 instead.
