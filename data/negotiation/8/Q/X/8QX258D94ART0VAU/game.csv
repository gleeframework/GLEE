"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still out of my price range. Let's try $10500.  This is my final offer,  and it's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so I'm offering the product to you for $12000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
