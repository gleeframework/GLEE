"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $11,000? This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,000, so I'm offering $12,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
