"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $600000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $550000. This is a fair compromise, considering our previous discussions. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $550000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $525000, which is a significant step closer to your offer and a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, I'm still looking to get a bit more value for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $525000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the convenience of a quick and smooth transaction. I'm offering you the product for $527500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to close the deal.",527500.0,Alice,5,
