"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me, but I'm really hoping to stay within a $150 budget. How about we meet in the middle at $165? ",165.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $165. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $180 and $165. How about we try $172.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",172.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  $172.50 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $168? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",168.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to save a bit more, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $168. How about we try $170? It's a small compromise, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",170.0,Alice,5,
