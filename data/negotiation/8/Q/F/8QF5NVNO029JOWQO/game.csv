"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. You get a product worth $1,200,000 to you for a significant discount, and I get a great price for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's try to make this work!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. It's getting close to the price I'm comfortable with, and I think we're almost there.",920000.0,Bob,4,
