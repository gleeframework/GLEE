"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This offer reflects its true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $2,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now at $2,000,000? It's a strong offer that reflects the value you're getting, and it allows us to close the deal today.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, but I need to be upfront with you.  I have another buyer interested at a level closer to my original asking price. If we can't agree on $1,950,000 today, I'll need to offer it to them instead. I believe this product is worth it, but I also have to consider other opportunities.",1950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other buyers interested, but I'm still willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'm willing to meet you at $1,850,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to my limit. If I don't see a better offer, I'll be forced to consider buying from John for $1,500,000.",1850000.0,Bob,8,
