"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'll try to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm proposing $1,250,000. It's a compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob or John. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,150,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last proposals. I'm offering $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
