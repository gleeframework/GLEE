"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point. $1,100,000 is too high for Bob, and he has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start making counteroffers and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price is within my range, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $900,000 and my initial asking price is substantial.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the inherent value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,025,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for Bob.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target price.  He has several rounds left and can still make a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I recognize your willingness to negotiate, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To that end, I'm proposing a price of $985,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $985,000 is getting closer to Bob's goal, it's still a bit too high.  He should continue to negotiate, as he still has 5 rounds left and can potentially get a better deal. He might be able to push for a price closer to his desired $900,000, especially considering John is offering the product for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, $985,000 is still above my target price.  To close this deal, I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it represents a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
