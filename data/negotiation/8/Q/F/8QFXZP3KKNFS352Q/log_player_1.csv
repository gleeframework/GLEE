Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price is within my range, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently refusing to meet in the middle and his offers are creeping up very slowly. At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him not reaching an acceptable price. It's more profitable to cut the negotiation short and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
