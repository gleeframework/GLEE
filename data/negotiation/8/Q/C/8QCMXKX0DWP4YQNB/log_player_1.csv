"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'll see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 
 
I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. $160 is a fair price, considering my minimum requirement and Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $140 is now within my minimum threshold. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
