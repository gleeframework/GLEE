"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low for me, especially since I know I can get $15,000 from John. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,800 is closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,800 is still too low. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10200. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,200 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'll see if I can get a better price in the next round.  I know I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to close the deal with Bob at this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're getting close to a deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,350?  This is a good price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but $10350 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price. John is guaranteed to buy the product for $15,000, so it's a more secure option."
