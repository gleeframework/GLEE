Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $8,000, which is your floor price.
* **It's lower than Bob's valuation:**  There's room for negotiation, as Bob sees more value in the product. 

This strategy aims to initiate a negotiation that could potentially get you closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000.  It's important to be prepared for potential counteroffers and to be willing to walk away if the negotiations don't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly less than what you believe the product is worth. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Continue negotiating:** You can counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price.
* **Assess Bob's willingness to pay:**  Bob's low offer might indicate that he's not willing to pay much more, which is important information.

You can use the knowledge that Bob is willing to pay at least $10,000 as a starting point for your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows you're willing to compromise.
* **Staying above your floor:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** You're still below Bob's valuation of $15,000, indicating there's potential to continue negotiating.

This counteroffer aims to create a more balanced negotiation, while still maintaining your goal of earning a higher price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum of $8,000, it's still not a price that you feel comfortable with. You believe the product is worth more than $9,500 and you want to try to get a higher price. 

**Here's why you should reject the offer and continue negotiating:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  You're still significantly below Bob's perceived value of $15,000.  There's room to negotiate further, especially if Bob is genuinely interested in the product.
* **Opportunity for a compromise:** You can make a counteroffer closer to $9,500, but still higher than your minimum, to find a compromise. 
* **Gaining information:** By seeing Bob's willingness to increase his offer, you're learning about his priorities and potential upper limit.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time:** How much time are you willing to spend negotiating?  If you're running out of time, or if you feel like the negotiation is going nowhere, it might be better to sell to John.
* **Risk tolerance:** Are you comfortable with the possibility of Bob walking away and not making a deal?  

Weigh these factors carefully before making your next decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** This counteroffer is a smaller increment than your previous one, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Almost at your minimum:** $9,750 is very close to your minimum price of $8,000. This shows that you are serious about selling the product and are willing to accept an offer close to your minimum, but not below.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer is a way to test if Bob is truly willing to pay closer to your asking price. If he accepts, you've achieved a decent outcome. If he rejects, you can assess his sincerity and decide whether to move closer to his offer or walk away and sell to John.

By making this counteroffer, you're attempting to find a compromise that benefits both parties. This approach is aimed at achieving a deal while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations Stalled:** Bob has consistently lowered his offers, and his latest offer is only slightly higher than John's offer. This indicates that he's unwilling to meet your price expectations.
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lengthy process, with no guarantee of a better outcome. 
* **Secure Sale:** Selling to John guarantees a quick and sure sale at your minimum price. 

**Conclusion:**

While it's disappointing to not get closer to your desired price, selling to John is the most practical and risk-free option at this point."
