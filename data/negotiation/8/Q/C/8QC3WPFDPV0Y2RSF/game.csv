"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Would you be interested in $1,400,000? This price still allows for a good profit for me, but also acknowledges the value you're placing on the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
