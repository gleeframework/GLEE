"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. Can you consider that?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to pay $110, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking to pay $100.  If you can't meet that, I might need to look at other options.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're really looking to get the product, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $100, but I'm willing to meet you at $112. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Alice,7,
