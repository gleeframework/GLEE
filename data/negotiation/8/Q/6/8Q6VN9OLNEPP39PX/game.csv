"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $850000. My counteroffer to you is $920000. I believe this price reflects the product's true value, and I'm willing to consider it a fair compromise.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price. Would you be willing to meet me at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above $900000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $920000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so my final counteroffer to you is $915000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, Bob. I'm eager to hear your response.",915000.0,Alice,5,
