"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While your offer is tempting, it's a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down a little bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about $1,125,000? This reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a significant price advantage over other options.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
