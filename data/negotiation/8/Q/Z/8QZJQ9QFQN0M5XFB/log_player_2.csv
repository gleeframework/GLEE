"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I will reject Alice's offer because the product is worth $80 to me, and buying it for $95 would be a waste of money. I will try to get a better deal.
