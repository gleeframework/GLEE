"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is closer to her own valuation than to mine.  There's room for negotiation. I'll try to bring the price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? It's still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Alice is meeting my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and risking a worse deal or going with John for the same price."
