Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Focusing on value:** My message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think!"" 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:**  If Bob accepts, I make a decent profit. 
* **Explore other options:** If Bob rejects, I can counteroffer or move on to John for my desired price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, it signals he's interested. There's room for negotiation.
* **John is a safe backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong fallback position. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? It's still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer.
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I'm framing it as a ""good deal"" for him, emphasizing a win-win outcome.
* **Clear signal:**  I'm making it clear that I won't go any lower than $10,000, but I'm still open to negotiation.

This approach allows me to:

* **Maintain a profit:** $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Increase the chance of a deal:**  The compromise makes the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Stay in control:**  I'm setting a firm bottom line, while still signaling flexibility."
