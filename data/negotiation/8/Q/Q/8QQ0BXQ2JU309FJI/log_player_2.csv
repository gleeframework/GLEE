"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to start the negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  Cutting my losses and buying from John guarantees the best price."
