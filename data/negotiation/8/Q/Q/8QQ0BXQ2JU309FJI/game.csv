"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to start the negotiation. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its true market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little bit off. How about $950,000? That's a significant price jump from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
