Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $820,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

Alice is unlikely to budge further, and getting her down another $20,000 is risky with so few rounds left. You can get the product for your target price from John."
