"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product could be valuable for me, but your initial price is too high for my budget. I could consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your counteroffer of $600,000. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit high for me. Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $900,000. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close to what I can afford.  Would you consider $780,000? This is a firm offer.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $820,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",820000.0,Alice,7,
