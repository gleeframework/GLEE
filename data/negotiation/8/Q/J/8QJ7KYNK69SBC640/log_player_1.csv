Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but leaves room for negotiation and ensures a good chance of Bob accepting the offer. 

Here's why this strategy is good:

* **It's a fair starting point:** While you know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he may not be willing to pay that right away. This offer shows that you are willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  Bob can counter with a lower offer, and you can then decide whether to accept or counter again, potentially moving closer to his value.
* **It sets a clear baseline:** This offer establishes a strong starting point for the negotiation, making it more likely for Bob to be willing to compromise. 

However, remember that the best strategy depends on many factors like Bob's personality and negotiation style. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $50,000 lower than your initial offer, and you know the product is worth more to him. It's worthwhile to try to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price.  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is guaranteed, there's still a good chance to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway by lowering the price to $1,425,000. It shows that you are willing to negotiate and are close to agreeing on a price.  It's also a good strategy because:

* **It's a small adjustment:** This small decrease in price indicates your willingness to be flexible, making it more likely Bob will accept your offer. 
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** You can still negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but it keeps you closer to your target price than accepting his offer. 

Remember, this is a strategic move.  If Bob rejects this offer, you'll need to decide whether to accept his next offer,  make a counteroffer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still $180,000 below your initial offer and significantly lower than what you know the product is worth to him.  You should counteroffer again and see if you can reach a price closer to your target. There's still a good chance of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway again. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting your interests. 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **It's a smaller adjustment:** You're decreasing the price by only $25,000, signaling your desire to reach an agreement.
* **It's close to your target:** This offer is only $20,000 below your initial offer and closer to your desired outcome than accepting Bob's current offer. 
* **It keeps the negotiation moving:** It demonstrates your commitment to negotiating and encourages Bob to continue.

This counteroffer allows you to assess Bob's negotiation style.  If he rejects this offer, you will need to decide whether to accept his next offer, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations have reached a point where the potential gains are too small to justify further negotiation. Bob's offer of $1,370,000 is only $10,000 higher than his previous offer, indicating that he is unlikely to move much further. It's becoming increasingly likely that you'll be unable to secure a price closer to your target.

Given this situation, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most logical choice. It guarantees a sale and provides a decent profit, even though it's not your ideal outcome. 

It's important to remember that negotiation is a dynamic process and sometimes, the best strategy is to cut your losses and move on to secure a guaranteed deal."
