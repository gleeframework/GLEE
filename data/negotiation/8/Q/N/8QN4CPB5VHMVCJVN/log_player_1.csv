Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the product's worth to me. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than $12,000, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $13,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $13,250? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,250 is a good price for me, as it's above my minimum of $12,000 and gets me closer to my desired price. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially going lower."
