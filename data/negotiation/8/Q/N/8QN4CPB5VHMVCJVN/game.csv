"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the product's worth to me. Can you consider this price?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $13,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to find a compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $13,250? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13250.0,Bob,4,
