Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, this product is truly top-of-the-line. How about we settle at $13,500? It's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? I'm willing to pay that price for the product.

You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While it's less than I hoped for, getting $12,500 is significantly better than John's $10,000 offer. Bob is clearly anchored around this price point, and it's unlikely further negotiation will yield a substantially better outcome."
