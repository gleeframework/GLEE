```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently remained significantly below my minimum acceptable price. His latest offer of $925,000 is still far from the product's value to me.  It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. To avoid further time investment and potential losses, it's strategically sound to accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
