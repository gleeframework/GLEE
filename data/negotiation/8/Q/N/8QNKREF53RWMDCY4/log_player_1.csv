Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,999. I think it's a steal at this price and will be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John provides a $15,000 safety net.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price ($15,000) sets a high anchor in Bob's mind. While it's unlikely he'll pay this, it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message implies the product is valuable and could potentially sell to someone else, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's important to be aware that aggressively high initial offers can sometimes put off potential buyers. Gauging Bob's personality and negotiation style beforehand (if possible) could help refine the approach."
