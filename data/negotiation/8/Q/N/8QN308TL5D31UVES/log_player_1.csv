{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 200}

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price. John is a guaranteed sale at $150, which is more profitable."
