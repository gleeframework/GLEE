"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the integrity of our product's value. I am unable to accept $6,000. I propose we meet halfway at $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high for my budget.  How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. To further accommodate your budget, I propose a price of $8,500 for the product. This still maintains a fair value for our product while being more accessible for your current financial situation.",8500.0,Alice,5,
