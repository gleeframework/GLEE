Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $122? It's just a small step away from your offer, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to haggle Alice down further, $122 is a good price and close to her perceived value of the product. It's likely she won't go much lower, and we risk her ending the negotiation. Accepting at $122 ensures we get the product at a significant discount compared to John's price."
