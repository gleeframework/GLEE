""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $200.  I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest, but I can only pay up to $150 for the product. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I know I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price point. It makes more sense to take the sure thing than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
