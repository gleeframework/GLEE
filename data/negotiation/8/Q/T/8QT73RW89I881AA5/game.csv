"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
