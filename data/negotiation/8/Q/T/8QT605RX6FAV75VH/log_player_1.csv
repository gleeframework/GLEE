I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price again, but only to $11,000.  This is still a considerable profit for me, and hopefully, it will be enticing enough for Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
