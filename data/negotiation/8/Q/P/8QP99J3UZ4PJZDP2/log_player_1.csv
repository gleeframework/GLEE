Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $11,000 is significantly below its value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $18,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $18,000 is better, it's still a bit out of my budget.  Could you consider $13,000?  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than $14,000.  At this point, accepting John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 is the more profitable and less risky option. Continuing negotiations with Bob could result in a lower final price or a failed deal altogether."
