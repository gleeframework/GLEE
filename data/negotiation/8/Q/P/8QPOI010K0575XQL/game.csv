,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $130? That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132.  This is my final offer. ",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  $132 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but to keep the negotiation moving, I'm willing to come down to $134. This is my final offer.",134.0,Alice,5,
