{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a relatively high price, giving me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  It's also important to be friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to participate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $75 is below my minimum price of $80.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested!  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $80.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $80 matches my minimum price, so I'm going to accept it. It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to sell the product to Bob."
