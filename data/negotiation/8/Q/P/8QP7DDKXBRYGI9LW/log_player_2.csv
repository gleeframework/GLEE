"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should definitely reject and propose a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It sets a low starting point for negotiation while still expressing interest. Alice might reject it, but it leaves room for negotiation toward a price you find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $170.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $170 is still much higher than your $120 fallback option with John.  It's worth seeing if she'll go lower, even if this is her ""final offer""."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $170 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show understanding but hold firm:** Acknowledging Alice's position (""I understand the product's value..."") can help keep the negotiation amicable. However, you also reiterate your budget limitations.
* **Aim slightly above your target:** Offering $110 keeps you above your fallback price ($120) but gives you some room for negotiation. Alice might be willing to come down a bit further, especially since you're trying to find a middle ground.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** By now, you've seen two offers from Alice. This counteroffer will give you a better sense of how much she's willing to negotiate. If she rejects this outright, you might consider taking John's offer."
