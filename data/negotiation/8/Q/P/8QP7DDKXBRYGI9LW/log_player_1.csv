Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I'm providing a soft justification (""...great deal for what it offers"") without explicitly stating its features. This allows Bob to potentially justify the price in his mind.
* **Alternative:**  It's important to remember I have John as a backup buyer at $150.  If Bob outright rejects this initial high offer, I'm not losing much and can significantly lower the price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $80 is far below both my minimum price ($150) and my initial offer. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** Bob's lowball offer is likely a negotiation tactic.  By rejecting it outright, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and am willing to walk away from a bad deal.
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me a strong negotiating position. I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $170.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** I'm making a substantial drop from $200 to $170 to show flexibility, but I'm still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price.
* **Finality:**  By stating ""This is my final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm not willing to endlessly negotiate. 
* **Pressure:**  This puts the pressure back on Bob. He needs to decide if the product is worth $170 to him, knowing that I have a backup offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $170 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** While Bob increased his offer, $110 is still considerably below my minimum of $150. Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge this gap significantly.
* **Time Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a time cost. It delays the sale and potentially prevents me from finding other interested buyers.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit now than risk a lower offer from Bob or a protracted negotiation."
