Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum price.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,025,000, and while you might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more out of her, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her guns and losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 deal with John."
