"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional item that I believe would greatly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending an exclusive offer for you to acquire this product at a special price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from its market value of $12,000, tailored to recognize your early interest and commitment. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. I look forward to the opportunity to serve you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's message is misleading. She claims the market value is lower than her offer, which is a tactic to inflate the perceived value. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
