"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this amazing product for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's $120 offer, but you can do even better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or explore other sellers."
