"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate you're willing to part with this product, $110 is more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $95? That way we can both be happy with the deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $91.25. Let's close this deal!",91.25,Alice,5,
