"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate you're willing to part with this product, $110 is more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
 While $80 is more than Bob values the product, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $95? That way we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'll try to nudge Bob a little higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $91.25. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 91.25}
```"
