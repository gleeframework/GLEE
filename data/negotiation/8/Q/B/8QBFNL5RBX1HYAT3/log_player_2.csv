"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far higher than my maximum budget of $80.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate you're willing to part with this product, $110 is more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $95? That way we can both be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price of $80.  I can still try to negotiate further, especially since I have the option of buying from John at my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $91.25. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $91.25 is still above my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with within the remaining rounds. Since John is offering the product at my target price of $80, it's the most logical choice to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
