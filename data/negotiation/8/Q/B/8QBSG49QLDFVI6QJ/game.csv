"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,050,000 and call it a deal?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,080,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price. If you're still interested, I'm open to negotiating further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
