"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $200 is out of the question.  It's also too early to buy from John, as there's a chance Bob could get a better deal with Alice.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer.  It's a bold move, but Bob is trying to establish a low starting point for the negotiation. It's also a price that's still within Bob's acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he is willing to negotiate.  However, he is still keeping the price well below Alice's offer and within his budget. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still too high for Bob. He's determined to get the best deal possible and believes he can still get the product for less.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing Bob to continue trying to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

Bob is now getting closer to his maximum price point. This counteroffer shows a willingness to pay more, indicating that a deal might be close. It's also still lower than Alice's latest offer, keeping the negotiation going."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still determined to get the best possible price. Although Alice's offer is getting closer to his maximum, he's willing to risk losing a few rounds to see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise further, but Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  With only a few rounds remaining, he's getting close to his maximum, but still hoping to secure a deal below $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

With only one round left, Bob is running out of time and the price is still too high.  Buying from John at $100 guarantees Bob the product within his budget.  While he might be able to get a slightly better deal in the final round, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is too high."
