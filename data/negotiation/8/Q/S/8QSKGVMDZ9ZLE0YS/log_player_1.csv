Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage. Here's an offer that balances firmness with the potential for negotiation:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially setting the price at $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You start high but within a reasonable range. This anchors the negotiation in your favor.
* **Justification:** Briefly mentioning ""value and demand"" subtly implies you have other options.
* **Open to Discussion:** You invite Bob's thoughts, leaving room for a counter-offer while signaling you're not desperate.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, pushing Bob too hard (too close to $1,200,000) could make him walk away. You need to gauge his willingness to negotiate."
