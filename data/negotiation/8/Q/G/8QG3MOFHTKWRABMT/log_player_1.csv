Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob ($1,250,000). This is a good starting point as it gives me some room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and direct tone in my message. It's important to build rapport with Bob, and a straightforward approach is best in the early stages of negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping in mind that John is willing to pay the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000). This means I'm not desperate for a deal with Bob and can walk away if his counteroffers are unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. That's the highest I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Counter-Offer Potential:**  While his offer is lower, Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This means there is potential for a deal, but I need to push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, but that's my absolute minimum. It's better to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's a chance I can get a better price.

**Next Steps:** 

I will now send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my minimum price.  This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, but also a compromise from my initial offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum price. I'm also emphasizing the fairness and value of the deal for both parties. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping it will encourage him to reconsider his offer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows for a potential middle ground. Bob may accept this offer, or he might counter with a price slightly higher than his previous offer. I'm prepared to continue negotiating until we reach a mutually agreeable price or to sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1175000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired range. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as his offer suggests he's flexible and still interested in the product.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, but I'm confident I can potentially secure a higher price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** 

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still slightly below my minimum. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,190,000. This is a very fair price, considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're open to this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer is $1,190,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Final Offer Stance:** I'm framing this counteroffer as a ""final offer"" to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him.
* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my own minimum.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move. It's a smaller gap than before, making acceptance more likely. If Bob rejects, I will proceed to sell to John, as it's unlikely he'll go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1190000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1175000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is the same as his previous offer. This indicates that he is unwilling to budge further. 
* **Minimum Price:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, and Bob is not willing to meet this.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is now the best option. It guarantees my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which is unlikely to result in a higher offer.

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred a higher price, it's more advantageous to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed $1,200,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob, who seems unlikely to meet my minimum."
