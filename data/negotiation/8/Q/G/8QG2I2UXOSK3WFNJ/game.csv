"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for something worth so much to me. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $60? I think that's fair.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about $75? That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still quite far from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. How about $90? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with something positive.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
