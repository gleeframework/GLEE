Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for something worth so much to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $130, which is above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to see the value in the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard price, making it easier for Bob to counter and keep the negotiation going. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $150, so I have a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $60? I think that's fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum value of $150.  Accepting it would be a major loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested. This means there's potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** I can always sell to John for $150, so I don't need to accept a lowball offer. 

I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower but still profitable price:** I'm lowering the price from $130 to $100, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and comfortably above my minimum of $150.
* **Emphasize the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to nudge him closer to accepting.
* **Positive language:** I'm using phrases like ""substantial discount"" and ""fair price"" to frame the counteroffer in a positive light.

By doing this, I'm trying to find a compromise that allows me to make a decent profit while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about $75? That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While $75 is higher than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150. Accepting it would be a considerable financial loss.
* **John's offer is a much better alternative:**  I can sell to John for $150, which is more than double Bob's current offer.
* **Negotiation space is shrinking:** Bob's budget constraints are becoming apparent. Further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better offer. 

Since I have a strong alternative with John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer from him. If not, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still quite far from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. How about $90? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with something positive.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Offer:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $90, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $100 and his offer of $75. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" and emphasizing the positive outcome for both of us. 
* **Last Chance:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, this is likely my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'll move on to John's offer.

By offering a compromise and making it clear that this is a final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob towards accepting and secure a sale that is closer to my desired value."
