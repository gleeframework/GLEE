"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still quite far from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. How about $90? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with something positive.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It's better to cut the losses and go with the guaranteed $80 from John."
