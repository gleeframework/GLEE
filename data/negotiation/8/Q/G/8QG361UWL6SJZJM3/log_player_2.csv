"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product for a price of $1,000,000. I believe this represents excellent value for you, as you understand its true worth. While I'm confident in this deal, I do have another buyer ready to pay $800,000 if you decline. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing (likely):**  While Alice claims to have another buyer, it's in her best interest to make you think that to push the price higher.  It's unlikely she has another buyer at $800,000, especially since that's her own valuation of the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away. This might lead her to propose a lower price closer to her actual valuation. 
* **John is your backup:**  You have the security of buying from John at $1,200,000 if negotiations with Alice completely fail. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you're aiming for a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to $800,000. Even if she only comes down slightly, you'll still save money compared to buying from John."
