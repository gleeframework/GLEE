"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is still a bit lower than where I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $100.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $105 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. How about we settle on $110? ",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $110 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get it for $108. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $108 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for $110. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, we can always call it a day.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to pay $110. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $150 if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $107. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm out.",107.0,Bob,8,
