"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, significantly below Alice's initial price. This establishes that Bob is serious about negotiating and aims to secure a good deal. He's still offering a substantial amount, showing his interest in the product, but leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit more for the product.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $12500?  That seems fair, given the value and uniqueness of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,500, which is closer to Bob's budget. However, he's still aiming to save as much as possible.  There's still room for further negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows him to try and push for a lower price closer to his $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $11,000. It's my absolute maximum at this point.  If you're open to that, I'm ready to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing a willingness to be flexible. By offering $11,000, he's demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product, but he's still trying to get the best deal possible. This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and make a deal, or risk Bob buying from John at a higher price."
