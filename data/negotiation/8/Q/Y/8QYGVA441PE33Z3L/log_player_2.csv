"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You'll get a great product at a fair price, and I'll still get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still more than Bob is willing to spend.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he should reject Alice's offer."
