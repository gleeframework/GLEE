{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a lower price. You can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."

I'm still hoping for a lower price. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm hopeful Alice will accept."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is not budging much from her previous offer. It's getting close to my maximum price, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
