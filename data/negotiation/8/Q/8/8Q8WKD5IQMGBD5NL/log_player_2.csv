It's time to cut our losses. Alice seems unlikely to budge below $128, and she's using classic negotiation tactics to make you think this is her final offer.  It's not worth the risk of pushing further and potentially losing out on a better deal with John.  Buying from John for $150 ensures you get the product without further hassle."
