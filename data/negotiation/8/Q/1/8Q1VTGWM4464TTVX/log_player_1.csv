Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" and ""unique"" nature to justify the high price. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Even if he negotiates down, you're still likely to get a price significantly higher than $1,000,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to guarantee the sale, offering it at or slightly above $1,000,000 would be a safer approach."
