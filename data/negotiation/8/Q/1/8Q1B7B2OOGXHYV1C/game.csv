"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I can offer it to you for $9000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
