Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and you still make a significant profit over your $80 minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasize that the product is beneficial for Bob specifically, increasing his perceived value. 
* **First Refusal Strategy:** Letting Bob know he has the first opportunity adds a subtle pressure to accept before he potentially ""misses out."""
