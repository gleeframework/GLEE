Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $10,000, it hints at the product's value. Bob, knowing it's worth $8,000 to him, might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always fall back on John's guaranteed $8,000 offer."
