"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, my initial offer reflects the considerable investment and potential returns this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,025,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,025,000. I'm thinking of $950,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my budget limit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candor.  While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's a significant gap from what I can accept. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer. However, I value our conversation and believe we can still reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $995,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's true worth.",995000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about the other interested buyer, but I'm still not willing to go above $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
