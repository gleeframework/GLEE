Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 falls significantly short of the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a serious offer, reflecting my desire to find a middle ground."",

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $775,000 is closer to a reasonable price, we are still far away from our minimum acceptable price. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can push him a bit further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
