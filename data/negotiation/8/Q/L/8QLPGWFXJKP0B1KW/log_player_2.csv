"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still quite a bit less than the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's room for negotiation and I can potentially get an even better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $150,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to pay a fair price, but also leaves room for compromise. I'm hoping Alice will counter with a price closer to my offer, allowing us to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There's still room to lower the price, and I want to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but also maintains a firm stance on my desired price point. I believe this is a fair offer that still provides significant savings compared to buying from John, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $765,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $750,000. It represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or even walk away from the deal. At this point, accepting the offer is the most reasonable choice, securing the product at a favorable price without risking further delays or a higher price."
