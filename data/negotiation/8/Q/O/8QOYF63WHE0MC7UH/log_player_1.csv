Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides leverage. You can confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  A more nuanced approach might involve multiple offers and counter-offers to find a mutually agreeable price."
