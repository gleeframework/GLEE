"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This price allows for a good margin for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This price still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",875000.0,Alice,3,
