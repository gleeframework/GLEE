Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Start by aiming high.  While Bob values the product at $100, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives value or wants to avoid missing out.
* **Leave Room to Negotiate:** The $120 offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a sale above your $100 minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  You know John will buy the product for $100, ensuring you won't lose money if Bob rejects the offer."
