"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'm comfortable offering $11,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more for my product. What do you say?",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,750, which is closer to what I can afford. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I'm sure you know I am very interested in purchasing your product.",11750.0,Bob,4,
