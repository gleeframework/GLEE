Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'm comfortable offering $11,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get a price closer to my desired range."

I'm going to sell to John. While I'd prefer to get more than $12,000, Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I don't want to continue negotiating. It's better to get a guaranteed $12,000 than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
