Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's an offer that takes into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  I'm asking for $16,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $16,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Value-Based Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing specific numbers, encouraging Bob to consider its worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open and invites Bob to engage in a discussion about the price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might lower the initial offer slightly.
* **Market Conditions:** If similar products are selling for significantly more or less than $12,000, you'll need to adjust your strategy accordingly.
