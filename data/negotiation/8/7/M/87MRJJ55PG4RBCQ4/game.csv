"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $120 on this item. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm not able to go as low as $120, I'm willing to come down to $135. This still gives me a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to accommodate my budget. However, I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the item. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the back-and-forth. I'm close to my minimum, but I can't quite go as low as $125.  Would you be willing to meet me at $130? This is a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,5,
