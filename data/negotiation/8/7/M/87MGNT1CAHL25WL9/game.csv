"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value, potentially exceeding $1500000. While I can't disclose the exact details publicly, I'm confident this product can be a significant asset to your business.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1750000.  This price reflects the potential value I see in it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits us both. Let's schedule a time to chat and I'll share more information about the product and its potential.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
