"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the unique nature of the product, however, $12,000 is too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $5,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $5,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $7,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible and meet you halfway again. I'll offer $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
