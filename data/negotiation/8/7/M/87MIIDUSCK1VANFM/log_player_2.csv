# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $5,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $7,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible and meet you halfway again. I'll offer $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach $8,000 which is John's fixed price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a diminishing return at this point and risks missing out on John's guaranteed offer."
