Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to the product's true value to you.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" you subtly imply the product might be worth more than Bob anticipates, justifying the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. You can then potentially meet in the middle at a price that's still very profitable for you.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. This strong alternative gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
