"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $800,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be budget-friendly, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $980,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
