Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $15,500.  While we could try another counter-offer, it's getting too close to our maximum budget of $12,000.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets our needs, making it the safer and more financially sound choice at this point."
