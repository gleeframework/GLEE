"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, you can potentially do better. You have 10 rounds and your goal is to save as much money as possible. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a bold offer:** While $10,000 is likely lower than Alice wants, it establishes your desired price point and signals you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Show appreciation:**  Being polite and acknowledging Alice's effort builds a positive rapport.
* **Leave room for compromise:** $10,000 is your ideal price, but you're open to some negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good price, you are still under your $15,000 limit and there are more rounds to go. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price. Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and you can likely push for a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm happy to pay $11,000, which would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show appreciation:** Acknowledge Alice's compromise to build rapport.
* **Offer a slightly higher counter:** This shows you are serious about buying and willing to meet halfway, but you still push for your desired price range.
* **Frame it as a win-win:**  ""Fair deal for both of us"" suggests that this price is reasonable and mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:**  $11,250 is significantly lower than the $15,000 you'd pay John. 
* **Final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Limited rounds:** You have 5 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a deadlock. 

This is a good compromise and a solid deal within your budget."
