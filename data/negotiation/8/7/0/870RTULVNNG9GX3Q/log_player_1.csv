Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My starting price is $1,400,000. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $1,400,000.  Bob's offer is too low at this stage. I'm going to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,250,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $1,250,000, which is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price. With only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking a further negotiation.  I'm confident that I can make up for the slight loss by investing the money wisely."
