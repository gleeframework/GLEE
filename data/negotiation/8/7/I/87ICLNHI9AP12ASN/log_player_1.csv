Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a price that is higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my potential earnings while still being open to a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $17,000. This is a compromise from my original offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I hope this is a fair and reasonable price that will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I will accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,500 is a good compromise and is still a better deal than selling to John. I am confident that this price represents a fair value for both parties."
