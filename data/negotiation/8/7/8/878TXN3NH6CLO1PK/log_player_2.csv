"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, there's significant room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price closer to Alice's $800,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which would still be a great deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to negotiate and has dropped her price to $1,050,000. While this is a tempting price, Bob can still aim for a lower price closer to his target.  It's worth continuing negotiations to try to squeeze out more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to where I want to be, I still need to be a bit more budget-conscious. Let's try $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be budget-conscious, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:**  $1,000,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is well within Bob's budget.
* **Alice is firm:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, indicating a potential breakdown in negotiations if Bob rejects. 
* **Risk of going to John:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he runs the risk of having to pay John's much higher price of $1,500,000.

While Bob might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, it's not worth jeopardizing the deal and risking a higher price from John.  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,000,000 is the most strategic choice at this point."
