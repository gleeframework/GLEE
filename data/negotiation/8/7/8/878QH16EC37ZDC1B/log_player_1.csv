Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think it's a great value, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This price still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe the product is worth more than $14,000, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars. I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal, and I respect that. However, I'm still hesitant to go below $15,000.  This product is truly special, and I believe it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, and I understand the value you place on the product. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a better price from Bob,  $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price and I'm not willing to go lower.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk wasting more time negotiating with Bob."
