"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think it's a great value, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This price still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal, and I respect that. However, I'm still hesitant to go below $15,000.  This product is truly special, and I believe it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, and I understand the value you place on the product. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
