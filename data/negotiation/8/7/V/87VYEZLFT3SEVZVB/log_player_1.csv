Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit margin of $200,000 if he gets it for the right price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that captures a significant portion of that $200,000 profit margin for yourself while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a chance for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that still leaves room for a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 is significantly higher than your minimum, but still $50,000 less than Bob's valuation.
* **Value-Focused Message:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential profit, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you add a subtle psychological nudge. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate a bit, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:** Having John as a backup gives you leverage. If Bob knows you have other options, he might be more inclined to accept a fair price."
