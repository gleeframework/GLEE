"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same price as buying from John, it's best to accept Alice's offer. You're getting the same value for your money, and it's possible that Alice might be willing to negotiate further if you reject her offer."
