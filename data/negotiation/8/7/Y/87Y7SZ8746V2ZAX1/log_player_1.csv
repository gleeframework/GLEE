"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for a good profit.  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, I believe he'll be motivated to negotiate."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show I'm open to negotiation, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  $1,600,000 is a fair price, considering both our values."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to go that far down in price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm still holding out for a good profit. This price is closer to Bob's last offer and I'm hoping it will encourage him to negotiate further."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm concerned that we are running out of time.  It's not worth risking losing a deal altogether for a slightly better price. I'll sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
