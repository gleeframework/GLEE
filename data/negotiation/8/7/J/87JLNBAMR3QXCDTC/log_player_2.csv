{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90?  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100? Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer again. While $100 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get it for lower.  I'll see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $95.  This is my best offer, let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $97? That's just a few dollars more than your offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Alice's offer. While $97 is still a bit more than I wanted to spend, it's getting closer to my limit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to bargain."
