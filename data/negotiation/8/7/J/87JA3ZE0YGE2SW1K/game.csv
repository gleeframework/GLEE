"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This price is still below my ideal, but it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $990,000 is still not enough for me to let go of this product.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.  It's the maximum I can go at this point,  but I'm confident it's a win-win situation.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
