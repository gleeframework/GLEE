"Bob, I have a product I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I'm confident it would hold the same value for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a competitive price, but I'm willing to negotiate if you have any concerns. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
