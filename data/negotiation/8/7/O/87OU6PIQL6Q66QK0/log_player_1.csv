Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to counteroffer at $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and there's still room for him to increase his offer.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to go down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $11,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to stick with my strategy and continue negotiating. With 6 rounds left, I have time to see if Bob will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $11,200 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,350. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11350}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $11,300 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,300 is getting very close to my desired price, but I'm still not ready to sell just yet. I have 4 rounds remaining, and there's still a small chance Bob might agree to a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer one more time, hoping to close the deal at a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to lower my price just a bit more to $11,325. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident you won't regret this purchase. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11325} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $11,300 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at round 8, and Bob's counteroffer of $11,300 is only $25 away from my last counteroffer.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further. I'm running out of time, and I want to ensure I get at least my minimum price.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees that I meet my goal and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob that may ultimately fail to yield a satisfactory result."
