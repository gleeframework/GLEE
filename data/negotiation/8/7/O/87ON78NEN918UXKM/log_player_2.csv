"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's starting by offering a price that's $1,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating his seriousness in getting a good price while leaving room for negotiation.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while showing Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $9,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, offering $9,500. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's already saved $2,500 compared to buying from John. While it might be tempting to try for a lower price, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of the negotiation falling apart and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
