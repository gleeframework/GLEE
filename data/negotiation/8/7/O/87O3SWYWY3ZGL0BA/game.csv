"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us, but I understand its value might be different to you. Considering its quality and benefits, I propose we set the price at $95. This offers a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to your response.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you acknowledging the value difference. However, $95 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. How about we settle on $90 for the product? This price reflects its value while allowing for a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and pay $87.50. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we need. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",87.5,Bob,4,
