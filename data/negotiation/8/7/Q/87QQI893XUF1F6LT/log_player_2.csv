Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This offers a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price that still benefits both of us.
