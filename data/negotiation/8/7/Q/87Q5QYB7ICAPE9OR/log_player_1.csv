Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also highlights the value to Bob, setting a positive tone for the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$100 is far too low for me,  I'm not willing to go that low.  I will counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That's a fair price for both of us and I'm sure you'll still get great value out of the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
