"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me at the moment. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and the return on investment you'll see.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair and attractive offer considering the product's potential.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
