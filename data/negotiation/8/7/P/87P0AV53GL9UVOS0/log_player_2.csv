"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation. We should make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and get closer to a price we deem acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for showing me the product. I'm interested but your price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to lower the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating to try and get closer to our ideal price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We are moving closer to the middle ground. This offer shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $85 for the product. It's a great deal for you too, considering the product is worth $120 to you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm, but $85 is still too close to our maximum budget. We'll make one more counteroffer to test her resolve, but we'll be prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This offer represents a final attempt to secure the best possible deal. By splitting the difference between our previous offer and her last one, we show flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on our budget limitations. If Alice rejects this, we'll proceed to purchase from John."
