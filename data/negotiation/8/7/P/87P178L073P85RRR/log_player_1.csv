{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $8,000, so $10,000 is a good starting point to maximize your profit.
* **Below your minimum:**  You won't sell for less than $12,000, so you have room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Reasonable:** It's a fair starting price that leaves room for both of you to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9500 for your product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Counter-offer:** You can send a counteroffer that is closer to your target price of $12,000.
* **Test Bob's willingness:**  By rejecting, you see if Bob is truly willing to pay more. 

Remember, selling to John is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  My counteroffer of $11,000 is higher than Bob's $9,500 offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but not significantly reducing my profit.
* **Closer to my target:** This offer brings me closer to my desired $12,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation if necessary.
* **Reasonable compromise:** It's a reasonable offer that shows good faith and signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still interested in purchasing your product but would like to stay within my budget. I propose $10500 for the product. This offer allows you to make a reasonable profit while keeping the transaction within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not enough to satisfy my minimum profit margin. I want to see if I can push Bob further, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counter-offer again:** I can make another counteroffer, potentially closer to my desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's real budget:**  By rejecting, I can see how serious Bob is about buying the product.

If I feel like negotiations are becoming difficult, or if I want to avoid the risk of Bob backing out, I can always sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  To meet halfway, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it would still give me a fair profit. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate further while staying closer to my desired price.
* **Reasonable middle ground:** $11,500 is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's current offer of $10,500.
* **Increased urgency:**  By making a final counteroffer, I signal that I'm not willing to go much lower and it's time for Bob to decide."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price that fits within my budget. I would like to propose $11000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope it meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $11,000 is still below my desired $12,000, it's close enough to my minimum price that accepting it is worthwhile.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** There's a risk that Bob will walk away if I reject his offer. 
* **Good compromise:**  This offer represents a good compromise, and it's likely that I won't be able to get a significantly better price from Bob. 
* **Alternative buyer:** I always have the option to sell to John for $12,000, which means that I'm not under any significant pressure to get a much higher price. 

While I'd prefer to get $12,000, it's important to balance that with the potential of losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
