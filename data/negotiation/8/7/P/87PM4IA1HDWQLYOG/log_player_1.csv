``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation, and is still a good profit for me. I am also using positive language to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still below it. I'm going to try to negotiate further. I believe I can get a better price, or at least make him come closer to my minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While it's getting closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I want to try to get him to agree to at least $950,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,200,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $920,000 is still a bit below what I need. Would you consider $940,000?  It's a fair compromise that's just a small step from your last offer."", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable going above $920,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $930,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $930,000 is still below my minimum, it's getting very close.  There's a risk that I could continue negotiating and get a better offer from Bob, but I also risk him walking away entirely.  At this point, it's more likely that I'll end up selling to John for $1,200,000 if I continue to reject Bob's offers. It's better to take the $930,000 now and ensure a sale."
