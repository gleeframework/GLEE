"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While it's getting closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000. Can you consider it?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $920,000 is still a bit below what I need. Would you consider $940,000?  It's a fair compromise that's just a small step from your last offer.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable going above $920,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $930,000?",930000.0,Bob,6,
