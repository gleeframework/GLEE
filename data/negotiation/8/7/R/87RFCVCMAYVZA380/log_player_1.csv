Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a great deal for me.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  While I could start higher,  a price of $14,000 feels fair and reasonable given his valuation, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed $10,000 from John, so there's no risk of losing money."
