Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but not so high that it's likely to scare Bob off right away.  I want to see if I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. It's a bit of a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's offer.  I hope this will be more appealing to him, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 than to risk ending up with nothing."
