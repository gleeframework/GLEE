"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and quality.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for it. This reflects the value I place on it and would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,750. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value.",16750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This would allow both of us to get a decent deal and move forward. Let me know if you're open to it.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $16,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,5,
