"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective. While $1,300,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I understand your budgetary constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This revised offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to come down to $950,000. This would allow us both to walk away with a favorable deal. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
