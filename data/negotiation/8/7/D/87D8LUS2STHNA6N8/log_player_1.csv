"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob, making him more inclined to consider the price.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a price that maximizes my profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider. We have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if he's willing to negotiate up. However, I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John, which gives me leverage if Bob becomes too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time for negotiation:** I have 9 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **John as leverage:** Knowing I have a backup option with John gives me leverage to push for a higher price. 

**Strategy:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer. This will show him I'm serious about getting a fair price, but I'm still open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers ($1,050,000 and $1,250,000). 
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the value Bob is still getting at this price, making it more appealing.
* **Stronger stance:** While I'm compromising, I'm still maintaining a firm stance on what I'm willing to accept.

**Strategy:** I'm trying to build momentum towards a deal by showing a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. The goal is to get a price closer to my ideal without pushing Bob away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This price would be a good deal for both of us, and allow us to finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has come up from his initial offer, $1,100,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:** I'm confident that we can get closer to my desired price with continued negotiation. 
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:** I'll continue to counteroffer, aiming to find a compromise that gets us closer to a price I'm comfortable with. It's important to be firm but also show a willingness to work with Bob to reach a mutually agreeable solution."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000 -  this is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's get this deal done, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, only coming down by $25,000 from my previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to drastically lower my price.
* **Focus on compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm also subtly adding a sense of urgency by saying ""let's get this deal done"", hinting that I might be more inclined to accept John's offer if we don't come to an agreement soon.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming to signal to Bob that I'm approaching the limit of my flexibility. This is a risky move, but it's necessary to see if he's truly interested in reaching a deal or if he's just playing for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,110,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited time:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, but I'm confident I can get a better price with a few more rounds.
* **John's offer as leverage:** I have a strong fallback option with John's offer of $1,500,000, which gives me leverage to push for a higher price.

**Strategy:** I'll continue to counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between our offers and reach a mutually agreeable price that is closer to my desired value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $1,110,000 just isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,117,500. This is a very fair compromise and a great opportunity for both of us. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1117500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a very small concession, only increasing my offer by $7,500. This shows I'm committed to a deal but still holding firm on my price.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I highlight the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:** I subtly reiterate the urgency by saying ""let's close this deal.""

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming to nudge Bob closer to my desired price. This small concession shows I'm open to compromise, but I'm also demonstrating that I'm not willing to give up much more.  I'm hoping this will push Bob to accept, especially as we're approaching the later rounds of negotiation."
