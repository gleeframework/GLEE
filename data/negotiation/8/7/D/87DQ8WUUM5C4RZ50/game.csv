"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to work with you.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,300.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's only a small difference from your last offer.  Let's make this deal happen!",9300.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting a little frustrated with this back and forth.  I've already come down significantly.  Let's make this simple: $9,200. That's my final offer. If you don't take it, I'm going to move on to another buyer. ",9200.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your frustration, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,100 and $9,200, which would be $9,150. Can you consider this offer?",9150.0,Bob,8,
