I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to his price, I'm still not happy with $9,100. I'm hoping I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round, or I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."

I'm going to sell to John. I've reached my limit with Bob, and I'm not sure if we'll ever reach an agreement. While I'd prefer to get more than $8,000, I'm running out of time and I need to secure a sale."
