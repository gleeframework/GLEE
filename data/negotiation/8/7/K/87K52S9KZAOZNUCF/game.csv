"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This price reflects the product's value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,075,000. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
