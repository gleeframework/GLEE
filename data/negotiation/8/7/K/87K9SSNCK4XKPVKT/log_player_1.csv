Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,200,000, Alice should aim to get as close to that price as possible from Bob. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product at $1,200,000 to Bob is unlikely to be successful since it's only worth $1,000,000 to him.  Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value increases the chance of a sale while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Negotiation Room:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still lower the price slightly, knowing she has John as a backup buyer."
