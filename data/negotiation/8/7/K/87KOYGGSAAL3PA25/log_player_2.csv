"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  Could you do $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice came down a bit, $100 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to a compromise by suggesting a price directly in between our previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows willingness to compromise, but not at the expense of a significantly higher price."
