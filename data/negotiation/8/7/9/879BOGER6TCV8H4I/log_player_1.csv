Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and to reflect that, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize profit, but pushing too hard could lead to him rejecting the offer entirely."
