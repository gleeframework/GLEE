"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $950,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better.  He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, giving him leverage to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to suggest a price of $925,000 for the product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, but he's still got room to negotiate.  He can likely get the price down a little more, especially since he has the option to buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get it for $910,000.  This price is closer to my budget, and I believe we can both be happy with this outcome."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering your proposal, I am willing to sell the product for $920,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $920,000, which is a good price for Bob. He's only $10,000 away from his desired price of $910,000 and has already used 4 rounds of negotiation.  It's unlikely that he can get a significantly lower price in the remaining rounds, especially since John's price is $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer is the most prudent move."
