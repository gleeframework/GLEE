"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108.",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference and I pay $106?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $106. I'm still looking to get as much value as possible for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $106, so I'm offering it to you for $107.",107.0,Alice,5,
