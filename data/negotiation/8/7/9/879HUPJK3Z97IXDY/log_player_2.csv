The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95.  You can do better.  You'll counter-offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90?

You're still trying to get the best price.  While $90 is better than $95, you can likely do better.  You'll counter-offer again."
