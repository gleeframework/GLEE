{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting high allows room for negotiation while staying within a profitable range.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the potential value and long-term benefits, we subtly justify the high price without directly revealing our hand. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals that we're open to discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Goal:**

The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob, ideally close to his $1,000,000 valuation. This strategy balances confidence in the product's worth with a willingness to negotiate, increasing the chance of a successful sale above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
