"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John as a last resort."
