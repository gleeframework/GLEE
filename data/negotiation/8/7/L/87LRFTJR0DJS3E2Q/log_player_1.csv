Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows me to potentially earn a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This might make him feel like he's getting a small ""deal"" while still netting me a good profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I haven't included it in this message, setting the price at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very keen on the product, but still unsure."
