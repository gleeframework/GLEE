Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, and if that fails, I'll go with John's offer."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I've only got 4 rounds left, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to reach my goal.  To ensure I get the best possible price, I'm going to sell the product to John."
