"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700000 just yet. I'm willing to consider a price of $725000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $715000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'd like to see if we can find a way to meet in the middle again. What do you think?",715000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $715000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to consider a price of $725500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725500.0,Alice,5,
