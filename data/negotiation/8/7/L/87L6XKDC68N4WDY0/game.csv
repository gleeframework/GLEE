"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's priced fairly considering its potential value.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident this product holds significant value.  Let's meet in the middle at $1200000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still out of my price range.  Let's split the difference: I'll offer $900000. I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $900000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a good compromise for both of us, as it's closer to your budget while still reflecting the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm sticking to my offer of $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price for both of us, as I am prepared to buy immediately and avoid further negotiations. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
