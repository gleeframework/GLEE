Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your potential profit. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Positioning:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to subtly increase perceived value. 
* **Price:**  $1,350,000 sits comfortably within the negotiation range. It offers a significant profit margin for you while still being potentially appealing to Bob. 
* **Framing:** Presenting it as a ""fair deal"" encourages Bob to view it positively.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), you can tailor your message and price accordingly.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John provides a safety net, knowing if there are other potential buyers could influence your strategy.
