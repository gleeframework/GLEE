Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counter, and we can see if we can close the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum and it's likely he won't budge further.  It's better to secure a sale at a good price rather than risk further negotiation and possibly losing him entirely."
