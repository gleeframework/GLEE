"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This shows I'm serious about selling to you, but I also need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
