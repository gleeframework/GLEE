"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's room for negotiation. It's likely Alice values the product higher than $1,200,000, and we can leverage this to potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and your budget. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows for another round to potentially get a lower price, ideally closer to your initial counteroffer of $900,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than your last counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 you'd pay for the product from John.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing the negotiation may result in a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will refuse further counteroffers, leaving you with no option but to buy from John at a higher price. 

* **Potential for Compromise:** Alice has demonstrated a willingness to compromise. Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price, considering the potential for a higher price from John."
