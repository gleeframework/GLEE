"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering the value of the product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering $10,500.
* **John's Price:** John is offering the product for $12,000. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice's counteroffer is a significant drop from her initial price. Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John. Since Bob's goal is to save money, accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
