"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
