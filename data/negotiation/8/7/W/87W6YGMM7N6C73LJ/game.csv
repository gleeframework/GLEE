"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
