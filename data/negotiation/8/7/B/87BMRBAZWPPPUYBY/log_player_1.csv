{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to reach an agreement."
