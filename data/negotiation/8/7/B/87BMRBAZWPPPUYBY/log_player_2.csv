"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to save more. You can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $14,000, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for Alice to negotiate. The goal is to find a price that's both fair for both parties and allows you to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good deal. It's lower than your initial offer of $12,000, and it's significantly better than buying from John for $15,000. While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject your next offer, and then you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to accept the deal now and save $2,000 compared to John's offer."
