"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $125?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet closer to my initial offer, say $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $112.50?",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"It seems like we're getting closer, Alice. I'd be willing to do $100, my final offer.  It's a fair price considering John is selling at the same price.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, $100 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $115, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer.",115.0,Alice,7,
