Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It seems like we're getting closer, Alice. I'd be willing to do $100, my final offer.  It's a fair price considering John is selling at the same price."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, $100 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $115, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $112.5, and she's even dug in at $115.  You can get the product for $100 from John, meeting your absolute limit. There's no point in further negotiation."
