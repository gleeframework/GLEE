Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,450,000 is still a stretch for me.  Would you be open to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below what John is offering. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to go a few rounds to try and secure a better price from Bob."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is definitely getting closer to a reasonable offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. It's worth risking another round or two of negotiation to see if I can bridge the gap further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close! I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $1,125,000?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll reach my $1,200,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
