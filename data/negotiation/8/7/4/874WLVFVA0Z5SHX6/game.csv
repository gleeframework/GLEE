"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and reflects the value you'll gain from this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's get this done.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept. My final offer is $975,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a very reasonable offer considering the value this product brings. Let me know your decision.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your coming down, $975,000 is still above my limit. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I'm only able to offer $925,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's seal the deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to accept $950,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This offer stands as a testament to my commitment to getting this deal done.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
