Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $150?  That's still a great deal for a product that's worth much more to you."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds.  It's better to accept this offer than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John at a lower profit."
