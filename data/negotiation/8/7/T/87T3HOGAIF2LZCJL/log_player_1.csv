Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This means you still have some wiggle room if Bob counters.
* **It's a significant discount from John's offer:** This creates some urgency for Bob to make a decision.

The message is friendly and encourages Bob to respond, making the negotiation process smoother."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good amount, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $825000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that we might reach a stalemate, or he might walk away entirely.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I get my desired price and eliminates any further negotiation headaches."
