"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident that this product will be a significant asset to your operations. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($1,200,000).  Since you can buy the same product from John for your maximum price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
