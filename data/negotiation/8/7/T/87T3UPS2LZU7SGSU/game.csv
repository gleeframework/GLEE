"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,200,000.  Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $1,175,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This offer stands as long as we close the deal in this round.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
