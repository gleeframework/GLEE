,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $17,500.  This is a fair offer considering its worth.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd be willing to pay $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price here.  I'll come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
