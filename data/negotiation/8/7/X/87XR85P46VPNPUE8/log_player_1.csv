Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll find a lot of value in it. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $130 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning that Bob might ""find a lot of value"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth to him, potentially making him more receptive to a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good offer, it's still below my initial target. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further since Bob seems genuinely interested.  There's room to meet in the middle before I have to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I can definitely tell you're serious about this. How about we split the difference and settle on $125?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Splitting the difference is a classic negotiation tactic that signals fairness and a willingness to find a solution. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer brings the price closer to what both parties are willing to pay, potentially leading to a quick and agreeable resolution. 
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** By sticking to $125, I'm still aiming for a higher profit margin while acknowledging Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more like $115. Can we meet in the middle of that and $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $115 is still a significant profit above my minimum selling price of $100. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Bob is clearly set on a price closer to $115, and further haggling might make me appear inflexible.
* **Time Value:**  A sale now is generally better than the uncertainty of further negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer brings a sure profit."
