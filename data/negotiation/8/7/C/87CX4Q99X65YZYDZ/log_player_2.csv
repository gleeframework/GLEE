"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility open to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $10,000. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's still pushing for a price closer to his ideal. The $10,750 offer is a compromise that could be appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to Bob's target price. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or the negotiation breaking down is high. Accepting the offer at this point ensures Bob gets the product at a good price within his budget,  and it avoids the risk of ending up having to buy from John at a higher price."
