Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** You need to make at least $150, so offering it below that price is not an option.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.  
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $120 and $150.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $135 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you're above your minimum if he accepts outright.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to find a price that's beneficial for both parties:

* **For Bob:** The offer is above his valuation, but the ""special price"" framing might make it more appealing.
* **For Alice:** If Bob accepts, you get more than your minimum. If he rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired price."
