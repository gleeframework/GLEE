"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer of $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can still get the product from John for $12,000.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further with Alice before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $13,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product brings, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Since he can get the same product from John for $12,000, it's the most logical choice.  It avoids further negotiation and ensures he gets the product at his desired price."
