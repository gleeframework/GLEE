"I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer of $15,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $13,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product brings, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
