"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and it leaves room for us both to make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,250,000? This would be a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
