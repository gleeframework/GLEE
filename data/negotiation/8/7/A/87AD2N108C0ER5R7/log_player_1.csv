Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a premium for this product, so I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
