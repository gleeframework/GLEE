Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 undervalues the unique aspects and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique aspects, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While I could push for more, Bob seems firm on his price. Accepting his offer of $1,500,000 is a significant profit, and continuing negotiations risks losing him as a buyer altogether."
