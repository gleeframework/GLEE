"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This reflects a significant investment on my part and represents a fair compromise. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to my business, and I'm eager to move forward with the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $900,000 for the product. This price still reflects the value and quality of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $900,000 is still slightly above my budget.  To make this deal work, I'm offering $875,000.  This price represents a significant investment on my part and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm eager to finalize this purchase and see the value this product brings to my business.",875000.0,Bob,4,
