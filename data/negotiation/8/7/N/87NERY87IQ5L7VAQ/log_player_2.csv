"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still above his $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to go up to $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While Alice's offer of $9,000 is lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,875. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875.
