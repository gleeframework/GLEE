"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to go up to $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,875. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",8875.0,Alice,5,
