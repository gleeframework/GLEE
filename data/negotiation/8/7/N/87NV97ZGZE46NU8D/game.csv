"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to meet halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. How about we throw in a free accessory that's worth $15, and I'll sell it to you for $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
