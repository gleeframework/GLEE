**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($1,000,000).  As Bob, your goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate with John, potentially lowering the price closer to the $1,000,000 mark or finding a better deal elsewhere."
