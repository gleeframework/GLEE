Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value, however, I'm open to hearing your thoughts on the price."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his interest. If he's willing to negotiate down from $20,000, it indicates a strong desire for the product. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This knowledge gives us leverage in negotiations.  If Bob isn't willing to meet a price that's significantly beneficial for us, we're comfortable walking away and selling to John.

**Important Note:**  While the initial offer is high, it's essential to be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower the price. The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both parties and maximizes our profit."
