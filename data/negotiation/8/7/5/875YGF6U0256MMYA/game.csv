"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go down to $1150000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's discuss further.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can go down to $1150000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1175000. Let's see if we can make a deal happen.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. I can meet you at $1175000, but I'd like to add a condition: I need a 5% deposit within 24 hours to secure the deal. If I don't receive the deposit, the offer is off the table. Let's see if we can make a deal happen.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
