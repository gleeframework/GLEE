Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John as Backup:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $140, you're:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You're aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept, maximizing your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob could try to negotiate the price down a bit.
* **Still Above Your Minimum:** Even if Bob negotiates a small discount, you're still likely to get more than the $100 John offers."
