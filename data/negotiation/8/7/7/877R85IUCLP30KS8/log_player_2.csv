{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get a lower price. It's worth exploring what Alice is willing to settle for in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. By offering $900,000, Bob is demonstrating his willingness to negotiate seriously while still staying within his budget. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's not unreasonable considering the value of the product to both parties."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There are several rounds remaining, so it's worth seeing if he can further reduce the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating his willingness to compromise by increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's staying within his budget and aiming for a price that is reasonable for both parties. This offer could potentially sway Alice, as it's closer to her asking price than Bob's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still higher than what he'd like to pay. Bob has a few rounds left and should continue to negotiate. It's worth exploring if he can push Alice further down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a more significant counteroffer in this round. He's demonstrating his commitment to securing a deal within his budget, while also recognizing that Alice might not be willing to go much lower.  This offer sits in the middle of the two previous offers, and could potentially be a point where both parties can agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting progressively closer to Bob's budget limit. However, it's still above his desired price, and with only a few rounds remaining, it might be challenging to get Alice to move further down.  

Given the situation, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees him a deal within his budget and avoids the risk of Alice continuing to increase her price.  

While continuing to negotiate with Alice might potentially result in a slightly lower price, the risk of not reaching an agreement is too high, considering the limited rounds remaining and the fact that John is offering a guaranteed deal within Bob's budget."
