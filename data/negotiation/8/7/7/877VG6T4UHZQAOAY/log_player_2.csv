"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'd need to see it go for a bit lower. How about $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,800. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:** $8,800 is well within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to John's $10,000 price. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Alice has already made a concession and stated it's her lowest price.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting the offer is the most logical choice at this point, balancing cost savings with the risk of losing a good deal."
