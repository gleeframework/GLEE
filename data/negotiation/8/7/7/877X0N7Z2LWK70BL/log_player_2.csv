Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $110. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more sense to do that and save the extra $10."
