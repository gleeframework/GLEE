"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects a significant savings for you compared to selling it to John for $1,500,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a significant saving for you compared to selling it to John for $1,500,000, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm still a bit away from where I'd like to be. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'll offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is still a significant discount from the $1,500,000 you're willing to pay, but closer to my target. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  However, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000, which is a significant discount from what I could pay John and leaves a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more move. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll offer it to you for $1,225,000, which is still a significant discount from the $1,500,000 you're willing to pay, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand we're close, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from what I could pay John.  It's also a fair price for you, considering your lower value.  Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one last concession. However, I've already given you a significant discount from my minimum value, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer it to you for $1,225,000 one more time, but I'm not flexible on this price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider selling to John.",1225000.0,Alice,9,
