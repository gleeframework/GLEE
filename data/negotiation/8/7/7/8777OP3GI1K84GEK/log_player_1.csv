Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, and Bob is willing to pay more than your fallback option (John).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves you some room to negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates but is still interested. It's unlikely Bob will accept an offer right at his maximum perceived value ($12,000). 
* **Politeness and Respect:** The message is framed politely to encourage a positive interaction and potential negotiation. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
