"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you.  Let's work something out.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. This offer is valid for a limited time. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer, at $850,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. ",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference again and settle at $787,500? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",787500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $787,500 is simply not a viable price for me.  It's crucial for me to get at least $800,000 for this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value and potential of this product.  Please let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. We're getting close to the end of our negotiation, so I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,7,
