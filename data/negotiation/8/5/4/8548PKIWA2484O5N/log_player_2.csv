"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. This offer is valid for a limited time. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer, at $850,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $787,500 is simply not a viable price for me.  It's crucial for me to get at least $800,000 for this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value and potential of this product.  Please let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. We're getting close to the end of our negotiation, so I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to your maximum price. There's no point in risking further negotiation or going with John, as you won't get a better price."
