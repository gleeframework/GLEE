"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value it brings.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,600,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground here. I see your point, and I'm willing to come down a bit further to show my commitment to making this work. How about $1,450,000? This is a very aggressive price for me, but I believe in the mutual benefits of this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this. I appreciate you moving down on price. While $1,450,000 is closer, I can't quite justify that price point.  Could we settle at $1,350,000? I feel this is a fair offer considering the value it brings to my business.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
