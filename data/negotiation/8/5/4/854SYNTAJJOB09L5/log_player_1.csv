"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, which might justify the higher price in his mind.
* **Openness:** Expressing openness to discussion and a mutually beneficial arrangement fosters a collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is considerably lower than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and your initial asking price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's ample space for negotiation between Bob's offer and your acceptable price. It's too early to accept such a low offer.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000, so there's less pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value it brings."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** The message politely explains why you're rejecting Bob's initial offer, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Significant Movement:** Coming down to $1,600,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate but still keeps you above your absolute minimum.
* **Compromise Framing:**  Presenting it as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to view the new price favorably. 
* **Value Focus:**  The message continues to reiterate the value proposition, subtly justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,600,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased to $1,300,000, it remains below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Positive Trajectory:**  Bob is clearly negotiating and moving towards a more acceptable price point. There's still potential to reach a deal.
* **John as Leverage:**  You have the security of selling to John, giving you leverage to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground here. I see your point, and I'm willing to come down a bit further to show my commitment to making this work. How about $1,450,000? This is a very aggressive price for me, but I believe in the mutual benefits of this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're coming down in smaller increments now ($50,000), indicating you're getting closer to your bottom line.
* **""Aggressive Price"" Language:** This framing emphasizes you're making a significant concession and approaching your limit.
* **Mutual Benefit Emphasis:** Reiterating the shared value encourages Bob to accept and avoids framing the negotiation as purely price-driven.
* **Near Minimum:**  This offer is just slightly above your minimum acceptable price, signaling to Bob that you're serious but also not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this. I appreciate you moving down on price. While $1,450,000 is closer, I can't quite justify that price point.  Could we settle at $1,350,000? I feel this is a fair offer considering the value it brings to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate Risk:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's unlikely to meet your $1,500,000 minimum. You've reached a point where significant concessions are unlikely.
* **Time Value:**  You've already spent six rounds, and continuing to negotiate with Bob might not yield a significantly better result. There's an opportunity cost to consider.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at your desired price. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss of $150,000 compared to John's offer. 

**At this point, it's strategically advantageous to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John.**"
