"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. 
* **Strategic Offer:**  $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, offering a significant discount but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Politeness:**  The message remains polite and professional, keeping the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** While Bob can technically continue negotiating, Alice has already met him halfway, dropping her price to $10,800. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  At $10,800, Bob is still saving $1,200 compared to buying from John.  

This offer represents a good balance between potential savings and the risk of continuing the negotiation."
