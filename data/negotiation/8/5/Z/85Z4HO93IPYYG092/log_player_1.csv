Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still allows room for negotiation.  I'm also aiming to ensure I get a profit above my minimum of $150.  I'm ready to potentially adjust the price if Bob makes a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to pay $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that wouldn't cover my minimum value. 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm making a counteroffer of $150. This is my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can close the deal."
