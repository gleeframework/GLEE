"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. May I suggest a counteroffer of $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $125? It's still a fair price for the quality of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $125 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider $120 as a final offer?",120.0,Bob,4,
