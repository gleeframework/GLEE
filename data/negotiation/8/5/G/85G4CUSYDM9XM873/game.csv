"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $850000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1000000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $900000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $900000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
