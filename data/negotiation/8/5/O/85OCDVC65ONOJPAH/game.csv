"I understand you're interested in the product, but I have to make a living, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for it. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm not willing to go up to $107.50. I think we're getting too far away from my target price. I'm willing to go up to $97 for it.,97.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $99, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really need to get a good price for this product.",99.0,Alice,9,

I'm not willing to pay $99. I think we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to go up to $96 for it.,96.0,Bob,10,
