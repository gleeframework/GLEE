"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this deal happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to compromise.  Let's settle on $12,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,5,
