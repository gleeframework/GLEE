{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, and sets the stage for a potentially beneficial deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than $10,000 from John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Bob's offer:
