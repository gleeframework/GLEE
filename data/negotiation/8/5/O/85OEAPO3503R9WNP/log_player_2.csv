"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $11,500? "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,800 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and still within Bob's budget of $15,000.  While there might be room for further negotiation, the risk of losing the product to John or Alice ending the negotiations makes it worthwhile to accept this offer."
