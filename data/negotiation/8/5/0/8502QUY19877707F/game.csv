"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good price for this product. I can do $18000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $16000? Let's try to find a solution that's fair for everyone.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but that's my final concession. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
