"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $13,500 is closer to what I'm hoping for. However, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's meet in the middle at $14,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",14250.0,Alice,5,
