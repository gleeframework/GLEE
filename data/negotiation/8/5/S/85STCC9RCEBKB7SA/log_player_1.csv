Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is still above my minimum value, and hopefully closer to a point where we can reach an agreement. It shows I'm willing to compromise while still making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite there.  I'm going to make one last counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement.  If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is only a little over my minimum value, but I believe it's a fair compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm confident that I can sell to John for $10,000."
