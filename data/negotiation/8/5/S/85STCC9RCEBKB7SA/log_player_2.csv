"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $15,000 would be a bad deal.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This price is still within Bob's budget, but leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum value of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but it's still below Alice's latest offer. This could be a good middle ground to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still above his limit.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $10,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
