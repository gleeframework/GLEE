"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy in negotiations to start with an offer lower than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Significantly Lower:** By offering $7,000, we're signaling to Alice that her initial offer was significantly off the mark and encouraging her to move closer to our desired price range.
* **Polite and Open:** Maintaining a positive and open tone helps foster a collaborative atmosphere, which can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $8,200 is still above our target. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and no immediate pressure to buy from John. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we split the difference a little more? Would you be willing to do $7,600?"",
""product_price"": 7600
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** We're still aiming to get as close to our $7,000 target as possible.
* **Incremental Increase:**  By offering $7,600, we're showing Alice that we're willing to move up, but not dramatically.  
* **Splitting the Difference:** This approach can feel fair to both parties and help move negotiations towards a close."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800. That's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $7,800 is a solid price, well below John's offer and a significant savings from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Trying to push Alice further down carries the risk of her pulling out or becoming less willing to negotiate.  At this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk.
* **Time Value:** We've already made progress in five rounds, and accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially lengthy further negotiations."
