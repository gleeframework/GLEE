# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer you the product for $10,150. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.

``` 

At this point, Alice is getting very close to your price, and the difference is relatively small.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you risk her walking away completely if you push further.  It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially lose it and have to buy from John at a higher price."
