Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Create Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price that's still profitable for you. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, there's no risk of losing money."
