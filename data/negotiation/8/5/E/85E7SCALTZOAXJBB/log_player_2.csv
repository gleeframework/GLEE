"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm confident this is a fair price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  There's a significant difference between $12,000 and Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'd like to get closer to my initial price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,000. This is a good compromise, and Bob can save $4,000 compared to buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John and ending up paying $15,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
