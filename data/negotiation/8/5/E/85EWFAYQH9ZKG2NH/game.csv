"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Given my research and the market value, I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your position. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and offers a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm ready to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
