Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant returns you'll see. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob encourages him to consider the price seriously.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals your willingness to negotiate,  making Bob more likely to engage."
