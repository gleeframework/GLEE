"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let's get this done quickly!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and the potential savings for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I am aiming for a higher price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob. I will counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still provides you with significant savings and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,000,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward with the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal. It is significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to close the deal quickly."
