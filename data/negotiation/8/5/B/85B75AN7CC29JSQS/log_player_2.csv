"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This exceptional item holds immense value for us at $1,500,000, but I understand its significance to you might be worth $1,200,000. Considering this, I would like to extend a special offer to you. For a limited time, I am willing to consider selling the product to you at a price that reflects its true value and resonates with your budget. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or making an offer.

Warm regards,
Alice

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the price John is willing to sell at. By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John and save a substantial amount of money."
