"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, it's worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a steal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, $650,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a significant discount. What do you think?
