"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I think the product is a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $20,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $18,500?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 18500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still above John's offer and have room to negotiate. Bob is showing a willingness to move, and there's a chance we can still get a better price than $15,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but this needs to be my final offer.  How about $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, and we are now at a point where it is only slightly above John's offer. There is a risk that Bob will not go any higher, and we could lose out on both offers if we continue to push for more. Accepting his offer of $16,000 ensures a sale at a price above our minimum."
