Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his upper limit might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm not desperate to sell and John's offer is a safety net. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price, significantly higher than John's offer and close to my desired range.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal altogether to John outweighs the potential gains."
