Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the initial price a bit high. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,220,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, accepting Bob's offer of $1,220,000 is a good deal. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's well above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Saves Time:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on and there's no guarantee Bob will go higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** John's offer is a safe bet, but Bob's offer gives us a chance to earn an extra $20,000. 

At this point, the potential gain from further negotiation is likely outweighed by the risk of losing the current offer."
