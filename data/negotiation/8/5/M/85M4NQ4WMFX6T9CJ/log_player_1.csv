{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You want to get as close to the $12,000 value as possible, but you also don't want to scare Bob away with an overly aggressive price. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  By not asking for the full $12,000, it allows for a back-and-forth and leaves some space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's not too far from your floor:**  If Bob rejects, you can always go back to John for your guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,800 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum price. You can likely get more from Bob, and you'd be leaving money on the table by accepting his offer right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,800 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? That would be a fair compromise and allow us to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:**  This shows you're not willing to settle for his low price. 
* **Offers a compromise:** $10,500 is a midpoint between your last offer and his offer, showing you're willing to meet him halfway.
* **Keeps the deal alive:** This avoids a stalemate and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is a good deal for you. It's above your minimum price of $10,000, and it's close to your desired price.  While you might be able to squeeze a little more out of him with another counteroffer, it's likely that the negotiations will continue to go back and forth.  Accepting his offer now secures a good profit and avoids further risk of a stalemate."
