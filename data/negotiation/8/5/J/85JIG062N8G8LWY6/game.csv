"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
