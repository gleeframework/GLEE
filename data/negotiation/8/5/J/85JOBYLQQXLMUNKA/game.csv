"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $8,000 for the product?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could go up to $10,000.  Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a very fair offer, considering the true value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
