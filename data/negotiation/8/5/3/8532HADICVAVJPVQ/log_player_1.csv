Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget for this purchase. To be frank, I'm looking to keep this closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down on price?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. That said, $900,000 is still a big leap for me. To make this work, I'd need to be closer to the $750,000 range. If you're able to make that kind of adjustment, I think we could wrap this up quickly.

Bob's offer:
