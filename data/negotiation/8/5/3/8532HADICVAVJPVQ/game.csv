"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget for this purchase. To be frank, I'm looking to keep this closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down on price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your honest feedback, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows you to benefit from the product's potential.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. That said, $900,000 is still a big leap for me. To make this work, I'd need to be closer to the $750,000 range. If you're able to make that kind of adjustment, I think we could wrap this up quickly.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  That said, I've got to be honest, $850,000 is pushing my absolute limit. I can go up to $775,000, but that's really it.  It's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,7,
