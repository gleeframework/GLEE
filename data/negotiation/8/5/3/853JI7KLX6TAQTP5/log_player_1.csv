"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This allows for negotiation space and potentially maximizes my profit.
* **Unknown Value to Bob:** Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I need to start high and see how he reacts. 
* **Ten Rounds:** With 10 rounds, I have room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **John's Offer:** I have the safety net of John's offer, but I'll only use it as a last resort if I can't reach a good price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Than Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum ($1,000,000), it's still lower than what I'd like to get. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe there's room for both of us to compromise and find a better price.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not ready to settle for John's offer yet, as I'm hopeful of getting a higher price from Bob. 

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the initial offer.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product to me.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer is above my minimum of $1,000,000, but it's still lower than my desired price.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm hopeful that further negotiation can bring us closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safety net, I'm not ready to settle for it yet. 

I'll make a counteroffer closer to Bob's latest offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer significantly reduces the price gap between our offers.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm essentially meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. 
* **Urgency:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to show a willingness to come down in price to avoid potentially missing out on a deal.
* **John's Offer:**  While I'm still hoping for a better deal than John's offer, the remaining rounds are getting limited, and this price is still significantly higher than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is still lower than what I'd like, it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have 4 rounds remaining.  I need to be practical and not risk losing the deal. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  If I reject, Bob may not counteroffer, leaving me with John's offer as the only option. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** If I accept and Bob is serious about buying, he might make a counteroffer closer to my desired price in future rounds.

This offer balances the risk of losing the deal with the potential for a slightly better price in future rounds."
