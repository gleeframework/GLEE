"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to save some money if possible. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
