"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1350000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1350000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1425000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1425000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $1400000?  It's a fair price that gives us both some room to compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1425000 and $1400000, which would be $1412500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. Let me know if this is something you'd like to accept.",1412500.0,Alice,5,
