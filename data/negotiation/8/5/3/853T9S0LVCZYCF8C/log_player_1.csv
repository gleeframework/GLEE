"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is closer to my valuation ($1,500,000) than Bob's ($1,000,000). This gives me more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Offering a Discount:**  The message emphasizes that this is a discount, making the price appear more appealing.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I mention the value the product will bring to Bob's business, hoping to increase his perceived worth of the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving room to negotiate is important, as Bob is likely to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **There are still 8 rounds left.**  This gives me ample time to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **While John's offer is attractive, I want to explore all options before selling to him.**  There's a chance I can get a price closer to my target from Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000 but still higher than his offer of $900,000.  I will also emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of closing a deal with me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,050,000. This price still represents a significant discount from the true value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). 
* **Reiterating Value:** I emphasize the value and discount again, hoping to make the price more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and conveys a willingness to work together, making it less likely Bob will feel pressured.
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still room for further negotiation, but this offer is significantly closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,050,000. I'd be willing to pay $950,000, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** Accepting this offer would mean a significant financial loss for me. 
* **We are still early in the negotiation process with 6 rounds remaining.** This gives me more time to work with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **While John's offer is very tempting, I want to exhaust all avenues with Bob first.** There's still a chance we can agree on a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer that is slightly higher than his offer ($950,000) but still lower than my previous offer ($1,050,000). I will reiterate the value of the product and the potential benefits of closing the deal with me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $950,000 is still lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business, and it's a fair compromise considering our respective positions.  Let's close this deal and get you started with your new product!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price from $1,050,000 to $1,000,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value (Again):** I continue to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits it will bring to Bob's business.
* **Positive and Direct:**  The message is positive and direct, suggesting a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Closing the Deal:** I mention closing the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I will be prepared to consider his next offer and potentially make another small concession.  However, I will be keeping a close eye on the remaining rounds and will be prepared to sell to John if it becomes clear that I won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,000,000. I'd be willing to pay $980,000, which is a small compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $980,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial financial loss.
* **We're nearing the middle ground:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my target, there's still room to negotiate, and I believe we can reach a better price. 
* **John's offer is still on the table:**  I'm aware that I could sell to John for $1,500,000, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before taking that option. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer that is slightly higher than his offer ($980,000) but still lower than my previous offer ($1,000,000). I will emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of reaching an agreement now, reminding him that we only have 4 rounds left before I might have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $980,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $990,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and with only 3 rounds left, I really think we should close this deal. If we don't agree, I may have to accept John's offer of $1,500,000.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a very small concession by lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $990,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the limited rounds remaining and the potential for me to sell to John, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to close the deal.
* **Positive and Direct:**  The message is positive and direct, suggesting a desire to reach an agreement and avoid losing the deal.
* **Closing the Deal:** I mention closing the deal again, encouraging Bob to accept and move forward.

**Strategy:**

This offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it.  If he rejects it, I will have to carefully consider my options for round 8, weighing the potential of reaching a deal with Bob against the certainty of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $990,000. I'd be willing to pay $985,000, which is a small compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're very close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $985,000 is close to my minimum, but it's still below my desired range and wouldn't be a great financial outcome.
* **Only 2 rounds left:**  With only two rounds remaining, there's little time to negotiate further and reach a significantly better price. 
* **John's offer guarantees a good profit:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is a much more profitable option and will allow me to achieve my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Uncertainty with Bob:** I can't be sure if Bob will agree to a higher price in the next round, and the risk of getting a lower offer is too high. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time and the potential for a worse outcome with Bob, it's best to accept John's offer and secure a profitable sale."
