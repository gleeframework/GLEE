"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still more than Alice's value for the product. This means there's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $950,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value of $1,000,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Show my willingness to negotiate:**  It demonstrates I'm serious about buying the product but also want a good deal.
* **Leave room for compromise:** There's still space for Alice to counter with a price that's closer to my offer and still be profitable for her. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, which is a good compromise.  At this price, I'm saving $400,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much lower and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product at a good price."
