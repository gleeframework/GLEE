# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is still too high. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11500? It's a compromise, but I think we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $11,500 is still a bit high. You're still hoping to get a better price and have a few rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've managed to negotiate the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer. While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal, the risk of Alice walking away or you needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting Alice's offer at $11,250 is a good deal that saves you a considerable amount of money."
