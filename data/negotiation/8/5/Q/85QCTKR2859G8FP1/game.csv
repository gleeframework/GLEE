"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its market value, and I think it's a great starting point for us to work together.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its market value, and I think it's a great compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would that be feasible?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not comfortable going below $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
