"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,950000.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've done my research and I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Is that something you'd be interested in?",950000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to come down to $875,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,925000.0
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you at $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, you're tough!  I do appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000?  That's a firm offer from me.",900000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,915000.0
"I like your persistence, Bob! However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and my previous offer of $925,000, which is $912,500. I'm willing to go a bit higher than that to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you $915,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can seal the deal.",915000.0,Alice,7,,
