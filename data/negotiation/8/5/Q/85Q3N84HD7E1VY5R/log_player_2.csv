Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've done my research and I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Is that something you'd be interested in?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to come down to $875,000? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you at $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and my previous offer of $925,000, which is $912,500. I'm willing to go a bit higher than that to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you $915,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly sticking to a slow concession strategy. While we could likely push her a little lower over the next few rounds, the potential savings are getting smaller and smaller.  $915,000 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer."
