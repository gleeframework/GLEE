,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $10,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",10500.0,Bob,4,
