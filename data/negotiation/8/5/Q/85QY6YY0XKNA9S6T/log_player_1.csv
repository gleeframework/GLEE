While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,085,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  The offer is still $85,000 above my minimum acceptable price, representing a very good profit margin.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations further increases the risk of the deal falling through. Accepting now secures the profit.
* **Relationship:**  A slightly more collaborative approach could lead to a more positive long-term business relationship with Bob."
