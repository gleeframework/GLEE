"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. What do you say?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately far below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get a price closer to my asking price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer,  and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go down to $90, but I can't go any lower than that. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
