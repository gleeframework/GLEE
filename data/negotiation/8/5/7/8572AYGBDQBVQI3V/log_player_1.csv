Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you have room to negotiate.  Starting at $10,000 gives you a buffer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob is likely to negotiate.  By starting higher, you have room to lower the price slightly and still make a profit above your minimum.
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your minimum price. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
