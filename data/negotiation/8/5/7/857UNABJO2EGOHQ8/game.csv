"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that's worth at least that much to you.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 simply isn't enough.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's try to close the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth to you, while also allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
