Round 2
Bob's offer:

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $90 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $92 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  With only four rounds left, it's better to take what I can get."
