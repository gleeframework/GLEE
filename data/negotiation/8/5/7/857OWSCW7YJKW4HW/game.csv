"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This reflects the fact that I value your business and hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go to $780,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $780,000 is still a bit too low for me. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go down to $805,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you say?",805000.0,Alice,5,
