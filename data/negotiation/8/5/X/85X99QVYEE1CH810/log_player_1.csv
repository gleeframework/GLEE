{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to go with $8,000, I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and ensures a quick sale.  It's better to secure a sale at $9,000 than risk losing a deal by trying to push for a higher price."
