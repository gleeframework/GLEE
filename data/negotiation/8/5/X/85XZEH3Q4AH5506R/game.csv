"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, but I'm open to negotiation.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $500,000. Would you be willing to consider that range?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $700,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $700,000.  How about we try to find a compromise closer to $600,000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $650,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. $650,000 is getting closer, but I think we have a bit more room to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $625,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",625000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $625,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $640,000.
