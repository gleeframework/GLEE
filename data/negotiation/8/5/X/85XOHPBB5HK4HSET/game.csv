"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This would still give you a great deal, and I'd be able to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $875,000. This would represent a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your goal and me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's settle for $890,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
