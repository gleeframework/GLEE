"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's start the negotiation off strong. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This would still give you a great deal, and I'd be able to get closer to my target price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already moved closer to his initial counteroffer.  Continuing the negotiation gives Bob a better chance of achieving a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $875,000. This would represent a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your goal and me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's settle for $890,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $890,000 is very close to Bob's ideal price point of $850,000. 
* **Time is of the Essence:** With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a breakdown or force Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Potential for Compromise:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice has already shown flexibility and it's likely that the price won't drop significantly more. 

This offer represents a good compromise, and it's in Bob's best interest to accept and secure the deal before time runs out."
