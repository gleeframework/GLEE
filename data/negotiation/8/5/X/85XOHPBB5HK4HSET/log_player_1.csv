Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's start the negotiation off strong."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price, especially since Bob clearly sees the value of the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This would still give you a great deal, and I'd be able to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $875,000. This would represent a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your goal and me to stay within my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is tempting, we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's settle for $890,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
