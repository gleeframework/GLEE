Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than his initial offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $135? Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with $132. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $150. I'll counter with another offer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to go a little lower, but $132 is still a bit too far from what I need. How about $134? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 134}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $133. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This time, I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $134, $133 is closer to my minimum of $150 than my previous offer. It's worth closing the deal with Bob now rather than risking another rejection and potentially having to sell to John at $150."
