"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price that's slightly lower than its true value to you. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her valuation of the product ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the extra $50,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my preferred price point.  I can still potentially negotiate a lower price. There's value in continuing the negotiation rather than accepting her offer or going with John, who is offering the product for my maximum price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,180,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,180,000, which is only $20,000 less than what John is selling it for. The negotiation isn't likely to get me a much better price than what John is offering.  It's a better strategy to go with John at this point, as the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential savings."
