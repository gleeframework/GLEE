"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a starting point, offering a price slightly lower than what the product is worth to me but still higher than what it is worth to Bob.  This creates room for negotiation while keeping the price within my minimum acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is still a great deal for a product like this.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,600? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price,  $10,600 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,600 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,700 as a final compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10700}
