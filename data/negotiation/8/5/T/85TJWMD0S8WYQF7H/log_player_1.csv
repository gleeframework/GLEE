Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Agreement:** For a deal to happen, you need to find a price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the highest price Bob might accept without going over. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the current market."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting above Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:**  Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair deal"" project value.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""market worth"" provides a reason for the price without revealing specifics.

**Important Note:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum. You have a strong alternative with John."
