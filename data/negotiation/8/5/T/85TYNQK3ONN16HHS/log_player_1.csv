"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting high ($2,300,000) anchors the negotiation in our favor. Even if this price is unrealistic for Bob, it provides a buffer for negotiation and signals the product's high value. 
* **Positive language:**  The message uses positive phrasing (""excited,"" ""incredible,"" ""fair"") to create a collaborative and optimistic tone.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By stating this is a ""starting point,"" we clearly indicate our willingness to negotiate and hear Bob's perspective.

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility in the early stages of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's start our negotiation from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum and even John's offer. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open, and we can now work towards a more agreeable price. We are still in the early stages of negotiation and have room to maneuver before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to me and in the current market is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but measured decrease:** We lower our price by $300,000, showing flexibility but also emphasizing our stance on the product's high value. 
* **Justifying the price:** We reinforce our position by referencing the product's ""value"" and ""current market,"" subtly suggesting Bob might be undervaluing it.
* **Aiming for a middle ground:**  Our new price aims for a middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, encouraging him to meet us closer to our target. 

This strategy balances concession with firmness, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate while still striving for a price that reflects the product's true worth to us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and a fair starting point for us to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing both buyers is significant.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at our minimum acceptable price and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
