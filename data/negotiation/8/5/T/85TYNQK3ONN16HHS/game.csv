"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's start our negotiation from here.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to me and in the current market is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and a fair starting point for us to find a middle ground.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
