"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your budget ($2,300,000 vs. $1,000,000). It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You have 10 rounds and a fallback option with John, so there's no need to rush into an expensive deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's start our negotiation from here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:**  $1,200,000 is a starting point that keeps you within your maximum limit but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning is clear:**  The message explains your rationale for the counteroffer without being aggressive. 
* **Opening for discussion:** The message invites further discussion, showing that you're open to reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to me and in the current market is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget, but she's showing some willingness to negotiate.  Since you have multiple rounds and a fallback option with John, it's still worthwhile to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and a fair starting point for us to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  By raising your offer to $1,500,000, you're showing Alice that you're serious about negotiating while still staying within your budget.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes that your offer is a significant compromise, hoping to encourage Alice to meet you halfway.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  You're suggesting a starting point for finding a mutually agreeable price, which encourages further negotiation."
