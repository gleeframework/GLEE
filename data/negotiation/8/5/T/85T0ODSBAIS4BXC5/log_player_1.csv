Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I need to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  While I could start high, a price of $119 is a small premium over Bob's perceived value ($100) and might be enticing enough for him to accept.  
* **Time Sensitivity:** By adding a ""limited time"" element, I create a sense of urgency that could push Bob towards a quicker decision. 
 
This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
