"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number ($2,300,000), we set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's significantly higher than his perceived value, it might influence his counteroffers to be higher than they would have been otherwise.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling that the initial price isn't necessarily a final offer.

It's a balancing act. We want to start high but not so high that Bob immediately walks away. We'll adjust our approach based on Bob's response to this first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to you, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining.  Selling to John right now would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It seems we have some ground to cover to reach a deal. Considering its intrinsic value and potential, I'm proposing $1,950,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part, demonstrating my willingness to find a compromise."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant step down from our initial price of $2,300,000 to $1,950,000. This shows Bob we're flexible and serious about negotiating.
* **Still Above Target:**  The new price is still comfortably above our  $1,500,000 minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""intrinsic value and potential,"" we're subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying a higher price.
* **Encouraging a Counter:**  We're aiming to keep the negotiation moving. By making a significant move, we're signaling to Bob that we're expecting him to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can bridge this gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Become frustrated** with the negotiation process and walk away.
* **Lower his offer** in later rounds if he senses hesitation on our part.

Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $400,000, which is a favorable outcome.  It's generally better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it by pushing too hard for a slightly better one."
