"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $97 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $108. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, anything over $100 is pushing it for me. My final offer is $98.  If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to explore other options.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $108. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time at $104. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from here.",104.0,Alice,7,
