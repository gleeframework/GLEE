"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing what works best for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 falls significantly short of what I consider fair value for this product. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This takes into account the unique benefits it offers and the value it will bring to your specific needs. Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're committed to getting a good price for your product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate you moving closer to what I believe is a fair price.  To be candid, $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go on this. This product has significant value that will benefit you in the long run, even beyond your initial assessment.  I'm confident that once you see it in action, you'll agree it's worth every penny.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product based on our discussions. I'm ready to close the deal at this price.
