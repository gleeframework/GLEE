"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""immense value and potential,"" framing the product in a positive light without explicitly stating its worth to me. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I aim to maximize profit with Bob, I retain the option to walk away at any point and accept John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. Proceeding to the next round allows me to negotiate towards a more favorable outcome. I'm still comfortable walking away and accepting John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the $600,000 offer is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's unique features and potential."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price of $2,000,000 keeps me well above my $1,500,000 minimum and leaves space for further negotiation.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value without revealing my bottom line. I aim to create a sense of urgency by highlighting its ""unique features"" and ""potential."" 
* **John as Leverage:**  While I'm negotiating with Bob, the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage and prevents me from accepting an extremely low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I can offer you $700,000 for it.  This is a significant investment on my part and reflects the price point I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer increased by $100,000, but it's still far below my $1,500,000 minimum. This suggests his increments might be too slow to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Maintain Value Perception:**  Accepting $700,000 could give the impression that the product is worth even less, potentially hurting my position in future negotiations.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm willing to continue negotiating, but having John's standing offer of $1,500,000 gives me a strong alternative if the deal with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're not quite aligned yet. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,750,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end and acknowledges your interest."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm making a significant drop from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also holding firm above my $1,500,000 baseline.
* **Anchoring:** By stating this is a ""considerable compromise,"" I aim to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range and away from Bob's lower offers.
* **Time Pressure:** With five rounds remaining, I'm applying subtle pressure by highlighting the need to ""find a middle ground"" soon. 
* **John's Offer in Reserve:**  The safety net of John's $1,500,000 offer allows me to be more assertive in seeking a price closer to my product's true value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $800,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob explicitly stated $800,000 is his ""final offer."" This signals that he's unlikely to move significantly higher, even with further negotiation.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's final offer is still substantially below my $1,500,000 minimum. Accepting would result in a considerable financial loss.
* **Time Factor:**  With only four rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob will bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** John's standing offer guarantees me $1,500,000, a much more favorable outcome than continuing negotiations with Bob.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
