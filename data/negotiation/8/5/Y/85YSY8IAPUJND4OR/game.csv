"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the $600,000 offer is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's unique features and potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I can offer you $700,000 for it.  This is a significant investment on my part and reflects the price point I'm comfortable with.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're not quite aligned yet. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,750,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end and acknowledges your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
