"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. I think this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  This product is only worth $8,000 to me, so I'm willing to offer you $5,000.  I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $5,000. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500. Hopefully, we can find a price that works for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,500.
