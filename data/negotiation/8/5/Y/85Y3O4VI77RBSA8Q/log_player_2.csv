"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately outside of my budget. Given the value you've described, I'm willing to offer $1,800,000.  This reflects the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, her offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $2,050,000 is still beyond my budget. To find common ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,900,000. This is a significant step closer to your position while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are getting close. I value your willingness to negotiate and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,975,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept while still honoring the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  With limited rounds remaining, it's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John and secure the product at his desired price point.  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing out on the product entirely."
