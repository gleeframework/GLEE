{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay. I'm also being friendly and encouraging in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit though. How about $11,500? That would be a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm also explaining my reasoning and suggesting a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That would be a great deal for both of us, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  At $11,000, I'm still making a profit, and it seems like a good deal for both of us."
