"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit though. How about $11,500? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That would be a great deal for both of us, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
