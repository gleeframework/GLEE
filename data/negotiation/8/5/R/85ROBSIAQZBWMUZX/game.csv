"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to find a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your latest offer of $1,900,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. This still allows us to find a middle ground while keeping my financial needs in mind.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
