,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  It's still a great deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth that to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $950,000. Can you consider this compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,050,000. This would be a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to get a good deal, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm going to need to stick to $1,025,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can close this deal!",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm really struggling to justify the cost at $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $987,500. Can you consider this compromise?",987500.0,Bob,8,
