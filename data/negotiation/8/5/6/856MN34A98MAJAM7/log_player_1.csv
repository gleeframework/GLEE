Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is still higher than the $10,000 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to potentially negotiate.
* **Lower than John's offer:**  $14,000 is less than the guaranteed $15,000 from John, giving me some room to potentially close a deal with Bob.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:**  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired $15,000 value with Bob.
* **Maintain a backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John and ensure a good return."
