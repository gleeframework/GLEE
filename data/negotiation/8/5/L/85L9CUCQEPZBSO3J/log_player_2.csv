It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price:** You've negotiated Alice down to $1,050,000. While you could potentially get it for $1,000,000 from John, the remaining difference is relatively small. 
* **Risk:**  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you push too hard. Accepting now secures the product.

While getting the absolute lowest price is ideal, sometimes a slightly higher price is worth it for the certainty of securing the deal."
