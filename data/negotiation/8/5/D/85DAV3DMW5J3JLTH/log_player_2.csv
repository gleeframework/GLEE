{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Rejecting allows negotiation:**  Rejecting gives you the chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **John is a backup:** You have a guaranteed alternative with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting low:**  Offering $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing your serious interest in negotiating.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** It's still above your maximum budget, allowing for some negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and see if she's open to getting closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Alice has shown a willingness to come down, so continuing the negotiation is likely to yield a better result.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can still walk away and buy from John if the negotiations don't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is halfway between your previous offer ($900,000) and Alice's latest offer ($1,100,000). It shows you're serious about finding a compromise.
* **Staying within range:**  It's still below your budget, but leaves room for Alice to negotiate slightly higher if she's willing.
* **Building momentum:**  This counteroffer continues the trend of decreasing prices, which could encourage Alice to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is within budget:**  $1,050,000 is within your budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Slight overshoot:**  While it's slightly over your desired price, it's a small difference and likely worth it to avoid further negotiation.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice getting frustrated and ultimately rejecting further offers, leaving you with no deal or forced to buy from John at a slightly higher price.

At this point, it's a calculated risk. You are likely to get a better deal with further negotiation, but there's a chance of losing the deal entirely. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product for a price just slightly above your budget."
