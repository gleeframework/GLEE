Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This price is still a good value for you, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.
