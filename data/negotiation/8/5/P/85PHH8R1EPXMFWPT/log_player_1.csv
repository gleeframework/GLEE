Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm always open to negotiation,  $1,050,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a significant step closer to what I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob in the future if this deal goes well. Selling to John now means a higher price, but also means I lose the opportunity to build a relationship with Bob for future potential sales."
