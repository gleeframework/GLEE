"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a significant step closer to what I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
