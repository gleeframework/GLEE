"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, and a good starting point for us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,250,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired $1,000,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice or potentially buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob needs to start with a significant counteroffer to show Alice he's serious about getting a lower price.
* **Reasonable offer:** $1,050,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still above Bob's ideal price. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes that the offer is fair for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:** Alice's offer is still $150,000 above Bob's desired price.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can try to push for a price closer to his ideal $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John would guarantee a lower price, Bob might be able to secure a better deal with Alice if he continues negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a significant step closer to what I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Bob is gradually moving closer to his ideal price while acknowledging Alice's concessions.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message reiterates the importance of a fair deal for both parties, emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer represents a significant step towards Bob's target, putting pressure on Alice to close the deal."
