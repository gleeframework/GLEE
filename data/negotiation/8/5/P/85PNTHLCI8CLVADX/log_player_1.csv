Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start the negotiation significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring we don't settle for less than our guaranteed amount.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product without being overly specific. This aims to justify the high asking price. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By presenting it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" we aim to appeal to Bob's potential desire for a unique acquisition, potentially increasing his willingness to pay a premium.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. It's crucial to be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his responses and potentially lower the price if necessary. However, always aim to secure the best possible deal above our guaranteed $1,500,000."
