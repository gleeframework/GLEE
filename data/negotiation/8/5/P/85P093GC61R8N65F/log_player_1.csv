"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Motivating factor:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between my starting price and Bob's value, allowing for potential counteroffers and negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I have 8 rounds left to find a compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the leverage in my favor and encourages him to consider a higher price. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not in a rush to accept anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying significantly above Bob's proposal.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to reinforce why my price is justified.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I use phrases like ""Let's find a solution"" to keep the conversation open and encourage further negotiation. 
* **John's offer in the back of my mind:** My counteroffer is still well above what I would receive from John, allowing me to negotiate with Bob without feeling rushed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 6 rounds left, so there's still time to push for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the leverage in my favor.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I'm not in a rush to accept anything below my minimum, knowing I can sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm showing progress by reducing my price, but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Fair compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win. 
* **Keeping the pressure on:** My offer is still closer to my minimum than Bob's, subtly keeping the pressure on him to increase his offer. 
* **Maintaining the backup:** I'm aware of John's offer and am not in a hurry to accept anything too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, Alice, but I need to be more comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,750 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is running out:**  I only have 4 rounds left, so I need to be strategic and not rush into a bad deal. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the leverage in my favor and might encourage him to increase his offer further.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I'm not in a rush to accept anything below my minimum, knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $9,750 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $10,250? This is a good middle ground, and it allows us to both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer, creating urgency and potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Middle ground:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""good middle ground"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a decision, subtly suggesting that time is running out. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, knowing I can sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate significantly higher with Bob.
* **Low offer:**  Bob's offer of $9,625 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on a better deal.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending up with an even lower price or running out of time.

It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk ending up with less from Bob in the remaining rounds."
