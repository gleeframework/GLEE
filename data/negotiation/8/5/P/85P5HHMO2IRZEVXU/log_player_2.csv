"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $90 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.**  This is more than the product is worth to you ($100).
* **John's offer is $100.** This is your maximum acceptable price.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option.** It saves you $10 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
