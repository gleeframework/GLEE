"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $850,000, which is the highest I can go for now. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, I have a hard limit at $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make up for the difference somehow. How about we do $920,000, and I'll throw in some additional support and services that will make the product even more valuable to you?",920000.0,Alice,5,
