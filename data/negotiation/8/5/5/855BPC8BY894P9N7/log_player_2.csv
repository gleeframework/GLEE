"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** $650,000 is a good starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. Rejecting allows for negotiation and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price, hoping to establish a lower starting point for negotiation. This will give Alice room to counter while still leaving me with potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $550,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high.  There's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $525,000, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer of $450,000. Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a significant saving compared to John."
