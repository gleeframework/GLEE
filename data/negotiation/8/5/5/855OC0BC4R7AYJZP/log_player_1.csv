Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to Bob than it is to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $105. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit significantly higher than selling to John. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can get much more out of him.  It's still a better deal than selling to John, so I'll accept his offer."
