"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential for my business.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $950000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, however. I'm proposing $1050000, which still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a middle ground and make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000.
