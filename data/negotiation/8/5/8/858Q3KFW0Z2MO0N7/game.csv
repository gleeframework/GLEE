"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $160. How about $145?",145.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice! However, $152.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about $148?",148.0,Bob,6,
