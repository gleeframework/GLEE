Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me halfway?

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $150.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my price."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $160. How about $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $145 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we split the difference again?  $152.50 is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 152.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice! However, $152.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about $148? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $148
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While Bob's offer of $148 is getting closer to my minimum price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's getting late in the game.  I'm confident that I can get my minimum price of $150 from John, so I'll take the sure thing."
