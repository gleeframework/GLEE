"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $750,000? This still gives you a good return while allowing me to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This still gives you a significant savings over the product's true worth and allows me to earn a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that we can find a better agreement. Considering the current market conditions and the product's value to me, how about $780,000? This would allow us both to benefit from the transaction.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued negotiation.  $780,000 is still a bit below my ideal price point.  How about we settle on $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the current market.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
