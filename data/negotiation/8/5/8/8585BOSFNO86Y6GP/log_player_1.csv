Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a reasonable price:** It's below Bob's perceived value, but still allows you to earn a decent profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have room to adjust the price.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** It clearly states what you're willing to accept. 

If Bob rejects, we can adjust the offer based on his counteroffer and your desire to maximize your earnings. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $80, so there's no need to be afraid of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial target price. Bob's offer is a good indication that he's truly interested in the product and I'll likely be able to get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further. While $80 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $90? This would still leave you with a significant profit while giving me a fair return on the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a good compromise, and I'll accept it."
