,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have your budget, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $90. This is a fair price for the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
