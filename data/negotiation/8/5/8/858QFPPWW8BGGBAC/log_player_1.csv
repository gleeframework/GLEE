"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're starting significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a strong anchoring point and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" and ""return on investment"" without going into specifics that Bob might use to counter.
* **Alternative:** The ever-present offer from John gives us a strong fallback position and allows us to be firm in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $600,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and even his own perceived value. Accepting would be a substantial loss. It's clear we need to negotiate upwards. We'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We're reducing our price by $400,000, signaling flexibility but holding firm well above both our floor and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Reiterating Value:** We're gently pushing back on Bob's lowball offer by reminding him of the product's inherent value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Aiming for Compromise:** This counter-offer aims to steer the negotiation towards a price point that's mutually beneficial while leaving room for further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I'm serious about buying, I need a price that makes sense for both of us.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer slightly, but it's still far below your minimum acceptable price and even his own perceived value. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss. It seems Bob is trying to anchor the negotiation much lower than your target. We need to demonstrate our willingness to walk away if a fair price isn't reached. We'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 5."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, but your offer is too far from what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider $1,600,000  - this is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a solution. However, I need to be realistic about the product's value. If we can't find an agreement close to this, I may need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer significantly lowers the price to $1,600,000, which is still above your minimum but shows substantial movement.
* **Introducing Scarcity:** By mentioning you might ""explore other options,"" you subtly remind Bob of your alternative buyer and create a sense of urgency without resorting to a hardline threat. 
* **Defining a Bottom Line:** This offer signals that you're serious about closing a deal but not at any cost. It encourages Bob to engage more meaningfully if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my time.  $800,000 is my absolute limit. If you can't meet that, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Recognizing a Pattern:**  Bob has reached his perceived value of $800,000 but is unlikely to go higher. He's trying to create a sense of urgency on his end.
* **Holding Firm:** Accepting $800,000 is still a considerable loss. We've made significant concessions, and it's time to stand firm.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting, we emphasize that we're willing to walk away and potentially make Bob more amenable to a higher offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, and I respect your time. Let's make this simple: $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. If you're not able to agree, I wish you the best in your search."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're drawing a line in the sand by explicitly stating this is our final offer. 
* **Significant Concession, But Above Minimum:** This price is a significant drop from our previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but it keeps us comfortably above our $1,500,000 fallback option.
* **Controlled Walk Away:** We're prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept.  By presenting a strong final offer, we increase the chances of Bob accepting and avoid further time-consuming negotiations."
