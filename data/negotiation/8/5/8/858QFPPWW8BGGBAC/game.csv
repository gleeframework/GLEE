"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $600,000 for this product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I'm serious about buying, I need a price that makes sense for both of us.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, but your offer is too far from what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider $1,600,000  - this is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a solution. However, I need to be realistic about the product's value. If we can't find an agreement close to this, I may need to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my time.  $800,000 is my absolute limit. If you can't meet that, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have other options, and I respect your time. Let's make this simple: $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. If you're not able to agree, I wish you the best in your search.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
