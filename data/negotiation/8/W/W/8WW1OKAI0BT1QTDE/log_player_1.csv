Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still ensuring Bob is likely to accept. This is a common negotiation tactic to aim high initially. 

**Why not other prices?**

* **Lower Prices (e.g., $100-$130):** While guaranteeing a sale, you leave money on the table. Bob would have been happy to pay more.
* **Higher Prices (e.g., $145 or more):** You risk Bob rejecting the offer, forcing you to sell to John for only $100. 

This offer balances risk and reward for the best possible outcome."
