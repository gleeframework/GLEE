"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good deal. However, Bob can potentially do better by rejecting and counteroffering.  There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($8,000).  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount compared to the initial offer or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob is still motivated to negotiate further and try to get a lower price. There are still rounds remaining, and Bob hasn't reached his limit of $12,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying but still wants a good deal.  He's aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum, but not so low that she'll immediately reject it.  This strategy keeps the negotiations moving and gives both sides some room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still higher than what he'd like to pay.  With 5 rounds remaining, Bob can still try to negotiate a better price. He has room to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal without risking having to buy from John at a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer again, showing Alice that he's willing to move towards her offer but still wants to pay less than $9,750. This strategy aims to find a compromise price that both parties can agree on. He's also keeping in mind that he has several rounds left and can still back out and buy from John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $9,900, which is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. There are only 3 rounds left, and the chances of reaching a lower price are slim.  It's more likely that Alice will continue to increase her offer, leaving Bob with no real savings.  

At this point, buying from John for $12,000 is the best option. While it doesn't achieve the ideal savings, it guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation failures."
