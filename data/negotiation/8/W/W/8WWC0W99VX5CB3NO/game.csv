"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1000000 is a bit out of my range right now. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a significant investment for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that this product holds significant value for both of us, and I'm ready to close a deal at $900000. This price is fair and within my budget, allowing us to make a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on the value of this product. I can offer it to you for $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",920000.0,Alice,5,
