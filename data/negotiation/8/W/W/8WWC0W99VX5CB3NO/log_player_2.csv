"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is too high for Bob's budget.  While the product is valuable, Bob is determined to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant investment for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and rejecting Alice's offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price.  There's still room to bargain."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that this product holds significant value for both of us, and I'm ready to close a deal at $900,000. This price is fair and within my budget, allowing us to make a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on the value of this product. I can offer it to you for $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While there's a chance Alice might go lower, the negotiation has become increasingly difficult, and the potential for further concessions is uncertain. To avoid further delays and ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob decides to buy from John for $800,000."
