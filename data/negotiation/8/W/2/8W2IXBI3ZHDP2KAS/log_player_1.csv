Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob is worthwhile.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob. He gets it for $100,000 less than John, potentially swaying him towards a purchase.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring I can sell the product at my desired minimum if needed."
