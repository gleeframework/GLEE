"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit steep for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $105, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. How about we meet in the middle again, at $107.50? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
