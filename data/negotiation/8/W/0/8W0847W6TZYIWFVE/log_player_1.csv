"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, as I don't know Bob's valuation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-offer, but I'm prepared to walk away if it gets too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is better than my floor, but I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price with some negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $13,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $12,500 is a decent compromise. I'm worried about running out of rounds and being stuck with John's $10,000 offer. I'll take the deal and move on."
