"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob might encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Openness:** The message invites Bob to share his thoughts, fostering a more collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $14000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** While $14,000 is above my minimum, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's interest:** By rejecting the offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Strategic counter-offer:** I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a mutually acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm open to a compromise, how about $16,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $18,000 to $16,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** The message highlights the ""compromise"" aspect, making it seem like a fair and mutually beneficial solution.
* **Reiterating openness:**  The message again expresses openness to finding a ""happy"" deal, fostering a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $15000. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** $15,000 is only $1,000 away from my initial offer and significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Potential for future negotiations:**  Even though this deal is good, I can still potentially negotiate a better price with Bob in the future if he is open to it.
* **Time factor:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and leaves room for further negotiations if needed."
