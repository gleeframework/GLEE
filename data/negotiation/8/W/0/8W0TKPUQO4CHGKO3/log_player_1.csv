Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly reveal the product's worth to you, it implies significant value by mentioning ""potential"" and ""other interested parties,"" creating a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 significantly exceeds Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but is still a substantial discount from John's guaranteed purchase price ($1,500,000).

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, you secure a profit of $500,000, significantly more than your minimum.
2. **Maintain Flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum acceptable price."
