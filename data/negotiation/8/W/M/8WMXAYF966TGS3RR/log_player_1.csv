Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a safety net of selling to John for $12,000, aiming for the highest possible price from Bob is ideal.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $15,000 to Bob allows me to start negotiations higher.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Clear and Direct Communication:** The message is straightforward, highlighting the value proposition for Bob."
