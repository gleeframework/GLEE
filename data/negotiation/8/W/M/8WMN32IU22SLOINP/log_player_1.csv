"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $80, and allows room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay this price, but if not, there is room to lower the price in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than what I initially offered. I believe I can get a better price. I will try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that gives us both room to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will try to counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $90. This is a compromise between his offer and my previous counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that gives us both room to agree.  Since we're nearing the middle of the negotiation, I need to be careful not to go too low and risk losing out on a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $88 is only $8 below my initial offer and is a better deal than selling to John for $80.  With only four rounds remaining, it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely."
