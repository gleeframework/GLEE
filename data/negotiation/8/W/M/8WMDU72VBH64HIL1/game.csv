"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $900000 is significantly below the value I see in this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $1200000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1000000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $1100000? That's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
