I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I will try to counter with a higher price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I will accept Bob's offer. While I'd like more, it's only round 4 and I'm getting closer to my minimum.  It's a risk to keep negotiating, and John's offer is always a safe fallback."
