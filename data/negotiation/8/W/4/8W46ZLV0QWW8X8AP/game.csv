,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $9,050 is still a bit high for me. We've both come down in price, so let's make one final effort to find common ground. My final offer is $8,900. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to another option.",8900.0,Bob,8,
