"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $2,000,000. What are your initial thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm interested in purchasing the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I see your point, $1,200,000 is still quite a way off from what I have in mind.  To move us closer, how about we settle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
