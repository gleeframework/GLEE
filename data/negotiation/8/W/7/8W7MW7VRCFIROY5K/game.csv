"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  I believe its worth is easily above a million, but to kick off our negotiation, I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer for today.  I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I could do $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering its true value and allows us both to benefit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
