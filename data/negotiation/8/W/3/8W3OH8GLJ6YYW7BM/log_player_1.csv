{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum value for the product.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to negotiate a lower price, and you can potentially meet him in the middle.
* **It signals your confidence:** The price shows you believe in the product's value and are not desperate to sell. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on how the negotiation goes. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum.  You're better off rejecting Bob's offer and trying to get closer to your desired price.  You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a good offer, it's a little below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think that's a fair price that's beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Maintains your position:**  You're not immediately accepting a price below your minimum.
* **Offers a compromise:**  You're willing to meet Bob halfway, showing you're flexible.
* **Highlights the value:**  By mentioning that the price is ""beneficial for both of us"", you subtly remind Bob of the product's value.

Let's see if this gets you closer to your desired outcome!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full price of $10,000, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation. While Bob's offer is your minimum, you can always sell to John for the same price.  But, you've already invested time in the negotiation with Bob, and his offer is exactly what you'd get from John.

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Saves time and effort:** You avoid further negotiation and can finalize the deal.
* **Potential for future business:**  A successful negotiation with Bob might lead to future opportunities. 
* **No risk:** You're not taking any additional risk by accepting Bob's offer.

So, you should accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,000."
