"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a good offer, it's a little below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think that's a fair price that's beneficial for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full price of $10,000, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target",10000.0,Bob,4,
