"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000.

This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
