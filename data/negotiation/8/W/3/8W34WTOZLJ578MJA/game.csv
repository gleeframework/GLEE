"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it can bring to my business. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
