Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 

I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept such a drastic drop from my initial offer. I will counter with a new price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't agree.  I'm hoping he'll recognize the value of the product and come closer to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough to justify selling to him. John is offering a more reasonable price and it's not worth the risk of further negotiations with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John."
