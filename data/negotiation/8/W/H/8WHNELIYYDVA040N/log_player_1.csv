Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $120, aiming slightly lower increases the chance Bob accepts.
* **Appeal to Value:**  Highlighting that the price is special or limited-time can make it more enticing. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  There's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving you an opportunity to still get closer to your desired price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob values the product. If you knew he valued it at $80, you might try a different approach.
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer, but having John as a backup ensures you won't lose out completely."
