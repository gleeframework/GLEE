"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my maximum budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. It's a strong signal that you're serious about negotiating but also recognizes the product's value.

* **Room for Negotiation:** You've left some room for Alice to negotiate further, but you're still significantly below her asking price."
