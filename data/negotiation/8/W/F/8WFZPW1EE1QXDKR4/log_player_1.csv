"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, this high initial offer might make him think the product is worth more than he initially believed. It also establishes my willingness to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer, but I'll always keep the option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and my minimum acceptable price. While $750,000 is better than selling to John for $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation and I want to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for a good profit.  $1,200,000 is a significant amount, but it's also a compromise that might appeal to Bob. If he rejects again, I'll reconsider my options in the next round, but for now, I'm trying to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 without exploring further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. $1,050,000 is a good compromise that might be attractive to Bob. This offer shows my willingness to negotiate but also my determination to get a good price. If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate my options and might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I've been negotiating for a better price, but it seems like this is the best I can get from Bob. It's a good deal considering the value I place on the product, and it's better than selling to John for the same price."
