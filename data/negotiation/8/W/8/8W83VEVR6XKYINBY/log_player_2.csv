"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a product worth $15,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, you know you have a backup option at $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price slightly, so it's worth seeing if she'll budge."
