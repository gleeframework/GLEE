"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep. Would you be willing to do $1,075,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
