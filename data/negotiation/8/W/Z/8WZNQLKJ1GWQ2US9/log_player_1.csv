"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, but still below what the product is worth to me. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still above Bob's offer. This should keep the conversation going while getting closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping it above John's offer. This is a strategic move to show Bob I'm serious about selling to him, while still maintaining a good margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're already in round 6. There are only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure sale to John.  It's better to sell to John now and guarantee the $1,500,000."
