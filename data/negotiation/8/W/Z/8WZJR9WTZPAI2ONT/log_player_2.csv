Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $160?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $110.  How about $140? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and it's still significantly above your $120 fallback option with John.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a price you'll find acceptable."
