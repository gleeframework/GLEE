Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm willing to sell it for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a significant profit above your minimum ($100).
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** Offering it for a price too close to $150 (like $145) might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
