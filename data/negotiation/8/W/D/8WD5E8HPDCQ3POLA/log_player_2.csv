"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $962,500, Bob. I'm glad we're still in negotiations. I'll meet you at $980,000, which is just $17,500 above your last offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

We're in round 9, and Alice is clearly very good at this.  While we could try one more time, it's unlikely we'll get her much lower than $980,000. This price is significantly better than John's $1,200,000.  It's better to accept a good deal now than risk losing it."
