"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?"", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is willing to negotiate, she's unlikely to go below $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a risk of ending up with a price higher than John's offer."
