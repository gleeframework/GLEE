**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is offering the exact amount John is willing to pay.  There is no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and further negotiation risks him walking away entirely. It's wiser to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to risk ending up with nothing if Bob refuses to budge."
