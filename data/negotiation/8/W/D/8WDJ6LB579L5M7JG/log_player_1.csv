Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will give you valuable information for your next move. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John for $100 gives you a strong position. You don't have to settle for anything less than that amount. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have some bargaining power knowing:

* **Bob is interested:** His counteroffer indicates he sees value in the product.
* **John's offer:** I have a backup plan to sell for $100, making a loss unnecessary. 

I'll aim to negotiate closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I lowered my price by $15, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** The $105 price point keeps me comfortably above my $100 minimum. 
* **Middle Ground:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm framing the offer as fair and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain, Acceptable Loss:** While $95 is still below my ideal price, it's only a $5 difference from John's offer. Accepting this offer secures a small profit and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation. 
* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob's incremental increases suggest he might be reaching his maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now has value, rather than potentially dragging out negotiations with no guarantee of a significantly better offer."
