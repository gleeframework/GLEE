Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $150 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price, netting me a higher profit than I'd get from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise, mentions the price upfront, and subtly hints at the product's value to entice Bob."
