"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point.  It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate a better price.  The product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's still room to find a middle ground.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise, especially considering we are already halfway through the negotiations. Accepting this offer ensures I earn more than my minimum desired price of $8,000, and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price."
