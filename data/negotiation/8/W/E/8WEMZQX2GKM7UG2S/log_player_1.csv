Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **50% Markup:** The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only the product's objective worth to him. There's a risk he'll find the offer too high.
* **Negotiation:** This first offer is just the opening move. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate strategically."
