You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm not interested in paying $20,000 for a product that Alice thinks is worth more than $15,000. That's a significant markup. I'll reject Alice's offer and look for a better deal.
