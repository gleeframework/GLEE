Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Goal:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'll try to sell the product for more than John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **The Risk:**  Bob might not be willing to pay more than $1,000,000.  
* **The Strategy:**  I'm offering $1,500,000, which is a significant markup but hopefully still attractive to Bob. This gives me a good chance of getting more than John's offer while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary.

**Important Note:**  This is a strategic decision.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept.  If he rejects the offer, I'll still make $1,000,000 from selling to John."
