I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's value of $150 but above my minimum of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
