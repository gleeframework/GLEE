"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to negotiating a lower price? I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm proposing $17500 as a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $13750.  I truly believe this product is valuable, and I'd like to finalize a deal.",13750.0,Bob,4,
