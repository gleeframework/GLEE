"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to start significantly lower than Alice's asking price but not insultingly low. $90 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and shows interest, but it's clear that we won't accept the initial offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $90, we aim to meet somewhere in the middle, ideally closer to our target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This price still allows me to make a fair profit while remaining within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $98?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments to signal that we're still looking for a good deal.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** $98 is a strategic move, pushing closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and her counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  We want to keep the negotiation positive and collaborative."
