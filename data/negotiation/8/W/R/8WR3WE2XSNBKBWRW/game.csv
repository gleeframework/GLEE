"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $900,000.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is a more comfortable price range for me, and I'm excited about the possibility of acquiring this product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $750,000 is quite a bit below what I need to sell.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $775,000 is still not quite enough for me. How about we split the difference? I'm offering $812,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $812,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $795,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal possible. Let's make this final offer. I'm willing to lower my price to $800,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's the lowest I can go.  If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to accept John's offer.
