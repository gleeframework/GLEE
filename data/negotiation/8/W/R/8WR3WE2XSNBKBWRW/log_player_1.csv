Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is a more comfortable price range for me, and I'm excited about the possibility of acquiring this product. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price, but I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I'm not going to let the negotiations drag on forever."
