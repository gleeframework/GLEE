Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving some room for negotiation and giving Bob a good deal.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the value of the product.

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what we initially aimed for.  We can do better. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, we can try to close the gap and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $13,750?  This price still gives you a good deal and gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13750}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a strategic move: 

* **It's a compromise:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but still maintains a price point that benefits you.
* **It's a middle ground:** It splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's offer, making it a more attractive proposition for him. 
* **It sets a strong tone:** It shows you're serious about getting a good price while remaining open to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you need a price closer to your asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,125 is a good deal for us. It's a significant improvement from his previous offer, and it's just below the $13,750 counteroffer we made. Accepting this offer means we'll secure a profit, and it's likely that we won't be able to achieve a better price."
