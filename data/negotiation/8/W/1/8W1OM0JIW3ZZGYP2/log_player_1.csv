Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you still make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

I'm also setting the stage for a potential counteroffer. By mentioning the value to him, I'm planting the seed for him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leave room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for a product worth so much. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still too low, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
