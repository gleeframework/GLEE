"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $180 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $190?",190.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $175 for the product. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.,175.0,Bob,4,
