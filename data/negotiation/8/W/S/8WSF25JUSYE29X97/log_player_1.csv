{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances a few things:

* **My profit:** I'm aiming for a profit of $10, which is better than selling to John for $120.
* **Bob's interest:**  I'm offering a price that's still below what the product is worth to Bob, making it a potential win-win.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counteroffer if he's not satisfied with the initial price. 

I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the potential of making a better deal with him or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you consider $90?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than what Bob considers the product is worth, it's still a significant loss for me. I'd rather reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $110 or at least find a price that's more profitable than selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm starting to see the negotiation reaching a stalemate. Bob's offer of $95 is still a good amount for me,  as it would allow me to make a profit over what I would get from John. Although it's less than my initial goal of $110, continuing to counteroffer might risk losing the deal altogether. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $95."
