"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $1,200,000. I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll meet you at $1,100,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
