Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'll see the worth once you start using it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $19,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's work together to find a price we're both comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $14,500?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $14,500 is still too high for Bob. Even though he has more rounds to negotiate, John's offer is a guaranteed deal within Bob's budget. It's smarter to secure the product at a price he can afford rather than risking more rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
