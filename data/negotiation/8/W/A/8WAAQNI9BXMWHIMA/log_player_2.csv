**Reasoning:**

* **Leaves room for compromise:**  It's not so low that Alice would immediately reject it. It allows for a potential middle ground.
* **Leaves you with a buffer:** If Alice counters, you still have room to increase your offer slightly without exceeding your $15,000 limit."

* **Leaving some room:** You still have some wiggle room to increase your offer if necessary without going over your $15,000 limit."
