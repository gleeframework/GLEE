"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. Alice is clearly willing to sell for less, and John's offer provides a fallback option. By rejecting, you open the door for further negotiation with Alice."
