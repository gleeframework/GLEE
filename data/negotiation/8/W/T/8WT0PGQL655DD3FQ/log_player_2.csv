"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $1,300,000. This is more than Alice's value, so she has room to negotiate.
* **John's offer:** $1,500,000. This is Bob's upper limit.

Bob can do better than Alice's initial offer. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, and knows that Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,300,000.
* A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* This price is still above Alice's value, suggesting a potential win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,350,000. This is still more than Bob's preferred price. 
* **John's offer:** $1,500,000. This is Bob's upper limit.

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it is still above what he considers a good deal.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer: $1,350,000. 
* John's offer: $1,500,000.

Bob is trying to bridge the gap. He knows he can get a better deal than John's offer, but also needs to be realistic. 
By offering $1,300,000, Bob is showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price than Alice's last offer. This gives Alice an incentive to consider the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,400,000. This is getting closer to John's price and is no longer a good deal for Bob.
* **John's offer:** $1,500,000. This is Bob's upper limit.

At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. While a lower price is still possible, the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement are diminishing.  Since Bob's goal is to save money and he has a guaranteed option from John, it's wiser to buy the product from John."
