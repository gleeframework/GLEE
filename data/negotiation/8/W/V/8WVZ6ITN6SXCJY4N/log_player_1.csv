"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, while still maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response and the remaining rounds. However, I always have the option of selling to John for $12,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. I'm not desperate for a sale and can afford to wait for a better offer.
* **Strategic Bargaining:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can demonstrate my commitment to getting the best possible price. This will also give me leverage in the next round.
* **The Value of Time:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to explore better options.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price point. I'll keep the ""Sell to John"" option in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750 for the product. This price still reflects the value it brings to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I've lowered my price by $250, showing flexibility while still remaining profitable. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** I've emphasized the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain from owning it. This helps to justify the price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  My message clearly indicates a desire to find a mutually agreeable price, fostering a collaborative negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both Bob and me, ideally closer to my desired $12,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll continue to counteroffer strategically, keeping an eye on the remaining rounds and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $9600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,600 is only $400 away from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're in round 4, and with each round, my leverage weakens.  The longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely I am to have to accept a lower offer or sell to John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gain of an extra $400 is not worth the risk of ending up with a lower offer or selling to John at $12,000.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $9,600 is the most strategically sound decision. It allows me to make a profit, secure a sale quickly, and avoid the risk of losing out on a better offer or having to sell at my minimum."
