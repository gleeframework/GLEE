"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a fair price for the product, I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000.  This gives you a significant discount and allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price would allow me to cover my costs and make this deal a success for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
