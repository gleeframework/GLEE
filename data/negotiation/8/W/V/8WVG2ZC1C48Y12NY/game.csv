"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still a significant gap from what I consider a fair deal. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $880,000. This offer reflects my desire to close a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and say $790,000?",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $835,000? I believe that fairly reflects the value of the product and our negotiations.",835000.0,Alice,7,
