"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to you. Considering its high value and quality, I would like to propose a price of $110 for it. This offers you a great opportunity to acquire an item that is significantly below its market value while still allowing me to earn a fair profit. I believe this is a win-win situation. If this proposal suits you, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction.",110.0,Alice,1,
