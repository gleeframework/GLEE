"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to you. Considering its high value and quality, I would like to propose a price of $110 for it. This offers you a great opportunity to acquire an item that is significantly below its market value while still allowing me to earn a fair profit. I believe this is a win-win situation. If this proposal suits you, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and also cheaper than buying from John for $120. Accepting this offer saves you money and gets you the product."
