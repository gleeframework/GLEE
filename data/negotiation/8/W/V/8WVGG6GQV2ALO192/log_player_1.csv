Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an aggressive price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still aiming for a higher value. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than what I initially aimed for, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,350,000.  There's a chance I could continue negotiating and maybe get a slightly higher price, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
