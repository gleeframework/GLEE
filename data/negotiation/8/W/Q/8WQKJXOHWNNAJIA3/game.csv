"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
