"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better price by making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down to a price closer to your $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $950,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  John is offering the product at my limit, so it's the most financially sound decision to buy from him and end the negotiation with Alice."
