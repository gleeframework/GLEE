Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $10,000 and it's likely that if I reject this offer and counter, Bob might walk away or continue to offer lower prices.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
