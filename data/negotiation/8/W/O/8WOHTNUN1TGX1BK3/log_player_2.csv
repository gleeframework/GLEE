"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially save $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still fair considering its value to me and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price still allows you a good profit while giving me a fair return. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You can potentially still save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This price is a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference -  I'm offering the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing for a good return for you while remaining within my acceptable range.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and you're only $12,500 away from your target. It's unlikely you'll get a much lower price from Alice, and you're risking losing the deal if you keep rejecting her offers. At this point, accepting her offer is the most reasonable option to secure the product without paying the full $1,200,000 to John."
