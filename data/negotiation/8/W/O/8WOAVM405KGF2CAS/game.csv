"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $10,500. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm really trying to stay under $10,000.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but this time I'll go down to $10,250. I think that's the lowest I can go without losing money on this deal.",10250.0,Alice,7,
