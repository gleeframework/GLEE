Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm dropping the price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it above my minimum.  Hopefully this will be more appealing to Bob, but still allows me to make a profit."

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I want. At this point, I've gone back and forth with him a couple times, and it's looking like we're not going to reach an agreement. John is guaranteed to give me my minimum acceptable price, so it's best to cut my losses and sell to him."
