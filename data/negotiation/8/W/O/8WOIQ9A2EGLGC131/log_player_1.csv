Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to consider the offer.
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price:**  If Bob rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I get my minimum value. 

This approach maximizes my chances of getting a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
