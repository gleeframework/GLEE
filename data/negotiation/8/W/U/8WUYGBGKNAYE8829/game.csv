"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $13000. Is that something you'd be interested in?"
"I understand you're looking to stay within budget, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet your needs. I'm now offering the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate your willingness to adjust. I would like to counter with an offer of $11000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us both.",11000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $11000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering $12000, which is my minimum price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options."
"I've made a final adjustment to meet you in the middle, Bob. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",12000.0,Alice,5,,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price. I would like to counter with an offer of $11500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000, Bob. I've already made significant concessions to meet you in the middle. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer of $11500. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my minimum price. If not, I'll have to explore other options."
"I'm not willing to budge any further, Bob. I've made it clear that my minimum price is $12000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at that price. If not, I'll have to consider selling to someone else. The product is still available to you for $12000. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet the price of $12000. I would like to propose an offer of $11800 for the product. I hope this might be acceptable.",11800.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,"I've made it clear that my minimum price is $12000, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower. Your offer of $11800 is still $200 short of my minimum, and I'm not willing to compromise further. I'll have to consider selling to someone else."
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000, Bob. I'm not going to continue negotiating below my minimum price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at that price, but if not, I'll have to sell the product to someone else. The product is still available to you for $12000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,9,,
