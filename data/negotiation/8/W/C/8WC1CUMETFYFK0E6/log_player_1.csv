Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $11,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $12,800?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12800}

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $12,200 is a good deal and I'm confident I won't get a better offer.  I'm happy to close this deal with Bob."
