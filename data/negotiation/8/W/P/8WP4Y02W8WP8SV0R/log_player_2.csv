# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still significantly higher than my maximum of $8,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price given my budget and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, and I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. While we're getting closer,  I don't want to risk getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation and potentially miss out on buying the product altogether.  Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget."
