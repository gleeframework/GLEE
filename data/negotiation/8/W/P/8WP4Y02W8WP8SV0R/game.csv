"Alice, your offer of $18,000 is too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is limited to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price given my budget and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, and I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
