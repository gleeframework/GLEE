"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,750 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I can still achieve my minimum. Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Alice,5,
