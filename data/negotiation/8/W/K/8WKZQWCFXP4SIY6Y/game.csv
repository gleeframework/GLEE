"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  I'm willing to move down to $1,050,000 to reach an agreement. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
