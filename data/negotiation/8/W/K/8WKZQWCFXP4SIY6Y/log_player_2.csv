"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her offer of $1,100,000 is still closer to your maximum than her minimum.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  I'm willing to move down to $1,050,000 to reach an agreement. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering $1,050,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.** While you could try to negotiate lower, there's a chance Alice will dig in and you'll end up paying the full $1,200,000 to John. 
* **Secure the deal.** It's better to accept Alice's offer and save $150,000 compared to buying from John."
