"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still possible to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  There's no indication of Alice's minimum acceptable price, so there's room to counteroffer and try to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move.  It's a bold offer, but it's still within the range of my budget, and it leaves room for Alice to counter without going below my desired price. This strategy aims to quickly set a lower price point and see how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I can potentially squeeze out a bit more by continuing to negotiate.  There's still a gap between our prices, and continuing to negotiate could save me more money.  The risk of failing to reach a deal and having to buy from John for $1,500,000 is still outweighed by the potential to save $350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My previous counteroffer of $1,000,000 was rejected, but Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 shows a willingness to compromise.  I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,100,000, which is a more reasonable middle ground.  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway and could lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice walking away or me having to buy from John for $1,500,000.  At this point, accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's significantly less than John's offer and represents a good balance between saving money and finalizing the deal."
