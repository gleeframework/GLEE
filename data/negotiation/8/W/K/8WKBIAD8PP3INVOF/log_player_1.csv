Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Range:** This creates a potential negotiation range of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000).

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that $200,000 range as possible. Offering a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves money on the table. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 risks Bob rejecting the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a strategic investment that will yield significant returns for you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""confident it will exceed your expectations"" add perceived value.
* **Strategic Justification:** Positioning the purchase as a ""strategic investment"" emphasizes long-term benefits for Bob.
* **Strong Price Point:**  $1,150,000 captures a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly up or down based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
