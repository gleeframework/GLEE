"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering $925,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",925000.0,Alice,5,
