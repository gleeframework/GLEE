Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to make a deal today at the price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for a price between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and your minimum ($1,200,000) creates a potential win-win. 
* **The Offer:**  $1,150,000 allows Bob to potentially gain a significant benefit (if the product is worth more to him in use than $1,150,000) while still giving you a profit above your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Exclusivity:** By framing the offer as exclusive, you add a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate, or he might reject it outright. If that happens, you always have the safety net of selling to John."
