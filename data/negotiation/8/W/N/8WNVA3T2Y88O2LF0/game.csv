"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $102. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",102.0,Alice,5,
