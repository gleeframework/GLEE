"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  You can counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $105 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can still try to get a better price, especially since you have more rounds left. $110 is still higher than your maximum value, so try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $107.50. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $109. This is my final offer.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your maximum value of $100.  You have 5 rounds left, but it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice down to your price.  It's better to buy from John at $100 and save some money."
