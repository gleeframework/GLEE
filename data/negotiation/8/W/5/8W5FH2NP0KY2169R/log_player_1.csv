Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above the guarantee.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the message frames it as a deal by:
    * Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and Bob's ""expertise.""
    * Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" to create a sense of urgency.
* **Negotiation Room:** This high initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. I can then potentially settle at a price higher than John's offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
