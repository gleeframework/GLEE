"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm starting with an initial offer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value to you and leaves some room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe this price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a bit closer to my target. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that's closer to our target and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
