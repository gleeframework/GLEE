"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high.  There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price that's good for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I like the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to move the negotiation closer to a price I'm willing to pay while still leaving room for further bargaining if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'm not willing to jump to $9,500 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving in the right direction. We are splitting the difference again, signaling that I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. How about we meet at $9,250? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and it's close enough to my target price. Accepting now avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
