"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This recognizes the value it brings while still offering a potential for a strong return on your investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still substantially lower than both my valuation and John's standing offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a significant loss.  I'll push back firmly in the next round to see if he's serious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. While I'm open to negotiation, your current offer doesn't reflect the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a minimal concession and ensures I'm not undervaluing this asset."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm drawing a line in the sand this round. By stating it's my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm very close to walking away and taking John's offer.  This leaves Bob with a difficult decision, forcing him to consider if he's willing to lose the deal over the remaining price difference."
