Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit creates urgency, increasing the chance Bob will accept rather than risk losing the opportunity.

**Why this strategy is better than offering $800,000 directly:**

While accepting John's offer guarantees a profit, aiming for a higher price with Bob could result in significantly more earnings. Even if Bob negotiates the price down, there's a strong chance of securing a deal above $800,000."
