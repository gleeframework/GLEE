Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $125 is just too low for me.  This is my final offer: $135.  If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while there's a chance she'd go lower, it's not worth the risk. Accepting at $135 gets the product below your $150 maximum and saves you money compared to John."
