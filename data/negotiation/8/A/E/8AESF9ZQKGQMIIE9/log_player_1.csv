"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring I profit.  I'm leaving some space to potentially go lower if necessary but also hoping to avoid a protracted negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to reach a compromise quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, and it shows flexibility while demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  I've already rejected his offer twice, and going another round could lead to a counter-offer even lower than $125.  It's better to secure a sale now rather than potentially risk selling to John for $120 or ending up with no deal at all."
