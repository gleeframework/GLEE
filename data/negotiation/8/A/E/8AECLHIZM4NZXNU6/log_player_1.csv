Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming high within the ZOPA makes sense. However, being too aggressive could make Bob reject the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  Starting with a strong, confident tone sets the stage for a potentially favorable negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000  leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit.  

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to provide more negotiation space.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly more moderate initial offer could be beneficial.

**Remember:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate strategically to reach an agreement that works best for you."
