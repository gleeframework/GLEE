# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. My asking price is $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm looking for something closer to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and potential, and it gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
