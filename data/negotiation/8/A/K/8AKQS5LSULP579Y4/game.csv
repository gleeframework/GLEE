"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm looking for something closer to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and potential, and it gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from your original price, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I value your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and both our needs.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $970,000, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",970000.0,Bob,6,
