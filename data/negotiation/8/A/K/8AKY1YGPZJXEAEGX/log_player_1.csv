Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000).  This creates room for negotiation and leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your minimum. It's worth trying to see if you can get a bit closer to your $15,000 goal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
