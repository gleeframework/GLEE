Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but also to leave room for compromise.  I'll see how Bob responds before making further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.
