"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which would still allow you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which represents a significant profit for you and a fair price for me. Let's close this deal at this price.  ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $837,500, which is halfway between my last offer and your current one. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal.",837500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to give up on my initial offer just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,7,
