Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'm going to try and negotiate further. There's still time to get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite at the price I need to be at. How about $10,200? It's closer to your offer and closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I still need to save some money. How about we try $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full price for the product, but I really want to get it for this price.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not at the price I want. I think I can get a better price with a counteroffer. I have 4 rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've reached a point in the negotiation where Bob is unwilling to go any higher. It's better for me to sell to John and get my desired price of $15,000. I've only got two rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed higher price."
