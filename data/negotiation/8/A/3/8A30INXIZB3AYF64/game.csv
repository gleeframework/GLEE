I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,20000.0,Alice,1,

"I've made it clear that I'm willing to sell the product at a discount, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $17000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to come to an agreement. I'll make one last offer: I'll sell the product to you for $16500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16500.0,Alice,9,
