This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $50,000 less than John's price and $150,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. You risk Alice sticking to her price or the negotiations breaking down, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price."
