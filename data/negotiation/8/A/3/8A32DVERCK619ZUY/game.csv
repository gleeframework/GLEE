"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101.25? I'm trying to be fair here, and this would be a win-win for both of us.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $101.25. How about we try $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while, and I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. To be honest, $95 is still too low for me.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession:  $100. This is the very lowest I can go, but it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,7,
