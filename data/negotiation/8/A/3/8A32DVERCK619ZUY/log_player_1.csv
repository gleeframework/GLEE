"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting at $115, knowing it's a bit above Bob's perceived value but still potentially attractive. 
* **Setting the stage:**  I'm using friendly language to encourage a negotiation, but also subtly emphasizing the value of the product to him. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $15 margin gives me space to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  
* **Protecting myself:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm aware of my fallback option (John) at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and significantly less than my starting offer of $115. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unattractive, there's still room to negotiate. I can counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **Not rushing to John:**  I have 10 rounds, and John is a sure thing, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by reducing my price from $115 to $105, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of his interest in the product and that $105 is still a good deal for him.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Leaving room for more negotiation:** If Bob rejects again, I can still come down a bit further, but I don't want to give up too much too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $97.5 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **More room for negotiation:** I have more rounds left and can still counteroffer.  It's worth trying to get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safe option:**  While John is a sure thing, I'm not desperate. I'm confident I can close the deal with Bob with a little more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101.25? I'm trying to be fair here, and this would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 101.25} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but fair:**  I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by meeting him halfway again. This shows good faith and demonstrates that I'm serious about a deal.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm framing the price as a ""win-win,"" emphasizing that it's still a good deal for Bob while also getting closer to my desired price.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm aware that Bob may still reject this offer, but I'm setting the stage for a potential compromise in the next round if necessary. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm not rushing to sell to John yet, as I'm still confident that I can reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $101.25. How about we try $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $95 is still considerably below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  It's clear that Bob is not willing to budge much further.  
* **John is a safe haven:** With only four rounds left, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes the more attractive option.  I want to see if Bob will make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while, and I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. To be honest, $95 is still too low for me.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession:  $100. This is the very lowest I can go, but it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer and emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal.
* **High pressure:**  With only three rounds left, I'm creating a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Minimizing loss:**  While $100 is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's still within a reasonable range, and a better outcome than selling to John at $120.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob still rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round.  This is my last chance to secure a higher price from Bob."
