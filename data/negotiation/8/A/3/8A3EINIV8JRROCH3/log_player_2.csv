"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great deal and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than your $80 limit and what John is offering. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer of $60 gives us room to negotiate upwards towards our $80 limit.  It also signals to Alice that we're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $90? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above both our target price and John's offer. We have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer to a deal. Offering $75 puts us right in between our initial offer and Alice's latest price, showing willingness to compromise while staying below our $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $75, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $85? I think it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and $85 is above our $80 limit. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, making it the more financially sensible option now."
