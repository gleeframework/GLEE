"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the first offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $130 is still a bit more than you're willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$122.5 is still above your maximum price.  Reject and try to get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $120,  which is a fair compromise. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 120}
