"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price.  I'm also taking into account the minimum value to me ($15,000) and the potential of selling to John for that price if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a better price. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob and can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm offering $17,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,000. This is a good price considering my minimum value for the product and the fact that I can always sell to John for $15,000. It's also a good compromise, showing that Bob is willing to negotiate and meet me halfway."
