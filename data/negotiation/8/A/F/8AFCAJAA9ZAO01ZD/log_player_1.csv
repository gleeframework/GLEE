"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point. This price is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident John's offer will be my fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to close the deal, accepting his offer would mean a significant loss.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  This will give us a chance to find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but I'm still well above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate for a sale. Hopefully, it encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing a significant amount.  I'll reject his offer and try to push him higher with another counteroffer. I have plenty of rounds left and I'm not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to reach a compromise that's fair to both of us. This offer demonstrates that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm also unwilling to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still not high enough.  I'm not desperate, and I have more rounds to work with.  I'll reject his offer and try to push him higher with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm making a final push towards my desired price range. I'm only slightly lowering my previous offer, hoping to entice Bob into accepting. If he rejects this, I'm leaning towards selling to John and ending the negotiation."
