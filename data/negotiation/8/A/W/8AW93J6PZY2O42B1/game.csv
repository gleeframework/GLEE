"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $10000 is below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I am still unable to commit to $16000. Could we possibly discuss a price closer to $14000? I believe this might be a fair compromise for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $17000. I can offer you a compromise at $17000.
