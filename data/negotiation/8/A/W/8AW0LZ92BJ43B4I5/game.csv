"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I could let it go for $16,000.  I'm hoping we can close this soon.",16000.0,Alice,5,
