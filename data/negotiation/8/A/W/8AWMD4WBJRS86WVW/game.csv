"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant saving for you.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer to cover shipping. But $875,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle at $881,250. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",881250.0,Alice,7,
