"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my minimum price ($120) to allow for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the condition of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $100 for the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for negotiation as Bob is willing to pay something.
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can try to get a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. It's still a good value for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** While Bob is showing a willingness to pay more, we're still not at a point where it's beneficial for me to sell.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a little low. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's current offer ($105). This shows a willingness to meet in the middle and encourages a deal.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $112.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $107.5 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  We are getting closer, but there's still a gap.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm hoping to get a higher price in the next round or secure a deal with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit low. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $111.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on a great deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession by lowering my price from $112.50 to $111.  This shows flexibility.
* **Almost at minimum:** $111 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Urgency & Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential loss of a good deal to motivate Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we could come closer. I would like to propose a price of $109 for the item.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** There are only two rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $109 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **No guarantee of better deal:** I've already made significant concessions, and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer enough in the next round.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $120, ensuring a profit and avoiding further risk of negotiation."
