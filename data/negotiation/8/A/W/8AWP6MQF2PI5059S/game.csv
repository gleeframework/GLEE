"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. It's still a good value for you, and a fair price for me.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the item.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a little low. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit low. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $111.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on a great deal.  What do you say?",111.0,Alice,7,
