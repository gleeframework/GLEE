Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!

Round 5

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $15,250. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,250.
