Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. 
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it slightly below his perceived value ($11,500) creates a strong incentive for him to buy. 
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Why not higher?**

*  Asking for more than $11,500 significantly reduces the chance of Bob accepting, as it's too close to his maximum perceived value.

**Why not lower?**

* While offering a lower price guarantees a sale, Alice would miss out on potential profit. John's guaranteed purchase provides a safety net."
