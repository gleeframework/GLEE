"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $900000 is a starting point, it's significantly below my minimum value for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it offers you a considerable saving from my initial offer.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. Can you consider this compromise?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
