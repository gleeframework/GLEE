"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for you to profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for you to still profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
