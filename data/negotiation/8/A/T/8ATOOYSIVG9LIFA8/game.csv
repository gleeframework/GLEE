"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the potential benefits it offers.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can you meet me halfway and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the value this product presents. While your initial figure is appreciated, we're still a bit far apart. To move things forward, would you consider $1,900,000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the product's inherent worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to adjust the price, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,550,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings",1550000.0,Bob,4,
