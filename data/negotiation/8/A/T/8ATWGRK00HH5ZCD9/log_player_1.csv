"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below a certain point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this product, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable point. I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob just yet, so I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product brings. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's close to my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely. It's also a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $1,000,000."
