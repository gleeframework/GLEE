"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that price point be doable for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500, which would be $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",8000.0,Alice,5,
