"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $11,500 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue attempting to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I place on the product. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,250 is getting close to Bob's desired price point. Considering that Bob has 5 rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited. Also, buying from John for $15,000 would be much more expensive. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice at this point, as it secures the product at a price that is within Bob's budget and saves him significant money compared to buying from John."
