Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to sell it for at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's valuation maximizes your profit. Offering it at $110 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it enticing) while giving you a $30 profit over your minimum.

This strategy balances profit maximization with a good chance of Bob accepting the offer."
