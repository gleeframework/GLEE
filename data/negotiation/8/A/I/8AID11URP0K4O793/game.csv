"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see you're coming down, but I need you to meet me closer to my price range. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  That's a fair price, and it would get this deal done.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
