Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategically designed:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is higher than Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below my minimum:** It's below my $1,500,000 minimum, so I'm not giving away the farm.
* **It's a starting point:** This allows for back-and-forth negotiations and leaves me open to a counteroffer.

This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still keeping the negotiation open and potentially securing a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

Here's why I'm offering $1,150,000:

* **It's closer to my minimum:** This keeps me closer to my desired outcome.
* **It's a compromise:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **It's still above Bob's offer:** This gives me leverage in the negotiation and shows that I'm not desperate to sell.

By offering a counteroffer that is a compromise, I hope to keep the negotiation moving forward and potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John. Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating further.  John is offering a price that meets my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that guaranteed deal."
