"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the value it brings to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue bargaining."
