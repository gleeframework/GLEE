"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is above Bob's valuation of $1,200,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  Since I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 at any time, I'm comfortable starting high and seeing if Bob is willing to come close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm aiming to close the deal quickly, selling for $1,000,000 would be a significant loss for me.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  This will keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's valuation and closer to my desired price. This shows that I'm serious about a deal but am not willing to sell at a major loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not going to sell for a loss. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again, hoping we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a compromise, only $50,000 above my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're nearing an agreement and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but we're getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet Bob's valuation at $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept."
