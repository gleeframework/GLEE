"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price with her, or you can always fall back on buying from John."
