"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my minimum value and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  It's still lower than my minimum value, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000. I want to see if I can get Bob to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This time I'm offering my minimum value to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum value, and we're halfway through the negotiation rounds. There's no guarantee he'll increase his offer further, and I don't want to risk ending up with less than my minimum.  It's better to sell to John and get the guaranteed $10,000."
