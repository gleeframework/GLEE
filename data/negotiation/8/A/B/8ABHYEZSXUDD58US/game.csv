"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering its true value is worth much more to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
