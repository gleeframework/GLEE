"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize the value it holds for you, $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you consider $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
