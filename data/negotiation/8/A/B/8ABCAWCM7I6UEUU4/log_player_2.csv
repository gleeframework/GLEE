"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $110 is below your maximum price, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of Alice proposing a lower price, allowing you to save more money."
