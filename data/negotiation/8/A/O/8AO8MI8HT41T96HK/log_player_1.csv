Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set a high benchmark and see how Bob reacts. If he rejects, we can always negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my initial goal."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's lower than my initial goal, it's still a good price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for a lower amount."
