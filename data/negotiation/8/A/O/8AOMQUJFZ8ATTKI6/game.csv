"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $875,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant increase on my previous offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $700,000 is still below its true worth. How about meeting halfway at $800,000?",800000.0,Alice,5,
