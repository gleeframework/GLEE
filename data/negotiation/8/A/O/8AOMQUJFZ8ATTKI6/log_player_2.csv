"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's much closer to your maximum price than hers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, it establishes a starting point that's beneficial to you. 
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a much lower number first, you're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired range.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer gives you plenty of room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below your $1,000,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in her counteroffer, but it's still too high.  It seems she's willing to move towards a middle ground. Let's continue the negotiation and nudge her further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $875,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant increase on my previous offer."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Instead of another large jump, this offer shows willingness to move towards Alice's price, but at a pace that benefits you.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""significant increase"" subtly emphasizes that you're making a compromise.
* **Staying Below Target:** This offer keeps the negotiation well below your $1,000,000 walk-away point, giving you room to maneuver."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $700,000 is still below its true worth. How about meeting halfway at $800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's True Value:** Alice has reached her own valuation of the product ($800,000).  It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $200,000 less than your maximum budget and $1,000,000 less than buying from John.

This is a good deal! It's time to accept and secure the product at a favorable price."
