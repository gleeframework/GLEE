Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $875,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $875,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant increase on my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $700,000 is a significant jump from Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly less than our minimum and John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate and can likely push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $700,000 is still below its true worth. How about meeting halfway at $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Strong Position:**  We're holding firm at our absolute minimum, which is also John's offer. This shows Bob we're serious.
* **Appearance of Compromise:** By framing it as ""meeting halfway,"" we signal a willingness to negotiate, even though we're not budging from our lowest acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:** As we get closer to the 10-round limit, Bob might feel pressure to reach a deal."
