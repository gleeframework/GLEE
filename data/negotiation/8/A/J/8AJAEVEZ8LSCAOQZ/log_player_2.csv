"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still above my minimum price of $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

You can still get the product for $12,000 from John.  Alice is unwilling to go below $11,000, which is still too high. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,750. This is already a significant concession from my initial offer, and I'm not comfortable going below that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Alice is offering the product for $10,750, which is a good deal since you can buy it from John for $12,000. It's worth accepting the offer and saving $1,250."
