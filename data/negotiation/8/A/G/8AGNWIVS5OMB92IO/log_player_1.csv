Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone in my message to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open question to encourage Bob to respond and begin the negotiation process.

This offer balances my desire to maximize my profit while also leaving room for a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, I believe I can negotiate a higher price with him. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

I'll proceed with a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation going smoothly.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, keeping the negotiation open while still pushing for a price closer to my target."
