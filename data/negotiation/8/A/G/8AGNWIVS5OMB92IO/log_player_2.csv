"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is still a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to bring the price down significantly.  It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest while proposing a price that aligns better with my budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to my budget, and $125 is a reasonable compromise. It's not the absolute cheapest option, but it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
