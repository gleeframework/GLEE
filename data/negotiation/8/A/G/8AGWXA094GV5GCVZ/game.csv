"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $1,075,000 is really pushing my lower limit. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000, but that's my final offer.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
