"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a bit steep at $850000, and I'd like to see some flexibility on the price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $750000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $825000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800000. This product is truly unique and offers significant value.  I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer it to you for $800000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
