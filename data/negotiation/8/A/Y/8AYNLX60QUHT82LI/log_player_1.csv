I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Here's why I'm doing this:

* **Maximize profit:** I want to earn as much as possible. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering a higher price allows for some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate.
* **John as a safety net:** I know I can sell the product to John for $1,500,000, so there's no risk in asking for a higher price from Bob. 

I'm confident Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a premium for it."
