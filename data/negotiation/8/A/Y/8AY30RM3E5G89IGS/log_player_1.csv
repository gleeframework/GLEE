"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see how much value Bob places on the product.  It's important to note that if Bob rejects this offer, I have the option to accept John's offer for $8,000, so I'm not at risk of losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $7,000.  While it's close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this will be more appealing to Bob while still getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $7,500. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $8,000. I'm going to proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a more aggressive counteroffer than before, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I believe that Bob is starting to see the value of the product and might be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good deal considering I have the option to sell to John for the same price.  It's important to note that I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds, so it's better to secure this deal now and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
