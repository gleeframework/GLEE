"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800000 is certainly a starting point, I'm confident this product's value to you goes well beyond that. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, but it's still a price that reflects the product's true worth.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $950000.
