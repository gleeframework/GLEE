"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000). This sets a strong initial position and allows for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good deal. I'm confident that Bob, valuing the product at $1,200,000, will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is a decent offer, I'm not yet satisfied. I can still potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the product's value. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the negotiation process. It's close to my minimum, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely."
