"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still significantly above my minimum. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which is a fair compromise considering your value for the product. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $925,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $937,500. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal efficiently. What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $937,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $912,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",912500.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $925,000. I'll make one last counteroffer at $900,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,8,
