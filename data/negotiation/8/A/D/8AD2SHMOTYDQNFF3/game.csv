"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's try to close this deal at a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still not quite there. I'm willing to drop my price a bit more, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product's value.  Let's try $1,300,000.  It's a good middle ground and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  While $1,275,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,287,500.  This gives you a great deal, and me a price that works for my needs.  What do you say?",1287500.0,Alice,7,
