"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still above your maximum.  Rejecting allows you to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is closer to your target, you're still within your negotiation range and have room to try and push for a lower price.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's try to close this deal at a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're still not quite there. I'm willing to drop my price a bit more, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product's value.  Let's try $1,300,000.  It's a good middle ground and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still within your negotiation range and can potentially get a lower price. You only have 5 rounds left, but continuing to negotiate is worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  While $1,275,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,287,500.  This gives you a great deal, and me a price that works for my needs.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're now within a very small margin of your maximum budget, and you've only got 3 rounds left. It's a good time to accept the offer. If you reject, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and you risk losing out on the deal."
