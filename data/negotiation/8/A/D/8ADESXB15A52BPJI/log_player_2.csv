"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more than you want to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can get a better deal from John."
