"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $8,800 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $8,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,600. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $8,700 for the product. It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a great value for both of us.",8700.0,Alice,5,
