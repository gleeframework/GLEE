"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 at this point. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. This price is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great value for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
