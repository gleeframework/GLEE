You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 at this point. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. This price is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than my maximum budget. While it's a good price, it's better to stick to my initial goal of spending no more than $8,000. I'll buy the product from John for $8,000."
