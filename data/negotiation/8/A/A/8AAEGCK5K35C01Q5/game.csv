"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $13500. I'm offering you the product for $14250. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14250 is still a bit too expensive for me. I'm willing to pay up to $12000, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider meeting me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $12000, which is $13000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
