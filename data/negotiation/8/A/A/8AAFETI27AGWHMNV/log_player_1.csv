"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll love! I'm offering it for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price ($100) as it's more than my minimum acceptable price ($80) and gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by highlighting the product's value and offering a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob because I believe I can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a great price for this amazing product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $85. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $78 is a good offer. It's just above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and it seems likely that Bob won't go higher. Accepting this offer will ensure a sale and prevent me from losing a potential buyer, which could lead to a lower price from John."
