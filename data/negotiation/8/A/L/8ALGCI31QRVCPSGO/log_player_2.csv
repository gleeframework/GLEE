"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. To initiate the conversation, I propose a starting price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the benefits the product will bring to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be frank, I have a hard limit at $1,100,000 for this purchase.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 is pushing the boundaries of what I deem acceptable for this product. It's truly valuable and I wouldn't want to devalue it. My final offer is $1,225,000.  This leaves some room for us to find a middle ground. I need a decision on this, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing hardball and is unlikely to go much lower than her $1,225,000 offer.  While you might be able to squeeze out a tiny bit more savings with Alice, it's risky. You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John with certainty, making it the smarter choice at this point."
