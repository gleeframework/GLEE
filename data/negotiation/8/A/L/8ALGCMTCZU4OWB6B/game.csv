"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $9500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet somewhere in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $9000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to lose this opportunity to sell to you. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $9000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",8000.0,Bob,6,
