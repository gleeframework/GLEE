"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me while still allowing you a profitable deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to closing the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
