"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for Bob, but it is closer to his budget than the previous offer.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me while still allowing you a profitable deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to closing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,025,000 is still outside Bob's budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John and save the money.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get the price down to a point where Bob feels comfortable making the purchase."
