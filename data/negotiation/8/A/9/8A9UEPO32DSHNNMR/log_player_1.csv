Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 allows you to potentially gain an additional $300,000 compared to selling to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, it leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, still ensuring you a significant profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and securing a deal with Bob, who is your preferred buyer due to his higher valuation of the product."
