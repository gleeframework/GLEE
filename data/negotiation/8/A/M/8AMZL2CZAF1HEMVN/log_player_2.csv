"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $15,000.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, or try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a good starting point for negotiation.  It also leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to her desired value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and you should continue to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's desired value of $10,000, but still offers a significant saving for you. It also shows that you're willing to negotiate in good faith, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice's offer is only $1,000 less than what John is offering.  You've already made several counteroffers and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small price reduction.  It's time to accept John's offer and secure the product at the best possible price."
