Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested, but if he isn't, I can always fall back to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a more reasonable compromise, considering Bob's initial offer was too low. It still leaves some room for negotiation but is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not satisfactory. I'll reject it and make another counteroffer. I'm still hoping for a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm countering with $16,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still firm in my belief that the product is worth more than $15,000. I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Bob, but if not, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my desired value. I've been through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to agree on a price that works for both of us. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
