"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I place on this product, I'm willing to meet you partway.  How about we consider $2,100,000? I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential benefits for you.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
