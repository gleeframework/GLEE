"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for a price of $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.
* **Time to negotiate:**  There are still 9 rounds to go, providing plenty of time to work towards a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is very valuable to me, but that's the highest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's desire for a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $850,000 is still above Alice's minimum, allowing for potential concessions and a successful negotiation.
* **Sets a clear starting point:**  This counteroffer clarifies Bob's intentions and sets a firm baseline for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction:**  Her counteroffer of $900,000 shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still room for improvement:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's still room to get closer to his desired price of $850,000.
* **Time to leverage his position:**  With several rounds remaining, Bob can use this opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway by offering a price that's between their last offers.
* **Stronger position:**  By offering $875,000, Bob is still closer to his ideal price while maintaining a positive negotiation tone.
* **Time pressure:**  With fewer rounds left, it's important for Bob to keep the negotiation moving and show progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about we meet at $890,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can still be happy with.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the goal:** Alice's offer is only $20,000 above Bob's ideal price of $875,000.
* **Time pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance Alice might dig in and the deal could fall through.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer ensures a successful purchase and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether. The $890,000 price is still significantly better than buying from John for $1,000,000."
