"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is very valuable to me, but that's the highest I can go at this point.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about we meet at $890,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can still be happy with.  Let's work together to close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
