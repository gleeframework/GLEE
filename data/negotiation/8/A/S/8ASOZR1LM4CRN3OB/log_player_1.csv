Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is very valuable to me, but that's the highest I can go at this point.

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get him to come up slightly."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}

I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll see if I can get him to come up a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about we meet at $890,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can still be happy with.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
