"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints,  $7,500 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
