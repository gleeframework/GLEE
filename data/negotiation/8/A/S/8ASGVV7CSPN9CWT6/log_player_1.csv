Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room to potentially come down if necessary.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold. I hope it's enticing enough for him to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better price than $1,700,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,850,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is too low for me.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk further lowering the price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum acceptable price.  I'll go with that option."
