Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,200,000 (You have a guaranteed sale at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $800,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:**  Any price between $800,001 and $1,199,999 benefits both of you to some degree.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, closer to your minimum, while still giving Bob a reason to accept. Here's where understanding negotiation tactics can help:

* **Anchoring:** Start with a high price to set the expectation.
* **Justification:**  Provide a reason for your price (even if it's the product's value to you).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you exclusive first access to this product. Given its unique value proposition and potential return on investment, I'm valuing it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its long-term benefits."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""return on investment""  attempts to frame the price in terms of Bob's potential gain, not just your valuation. 
* **Exclusivity:**  The ""exclusive first access"" phrasing might make the offer more appealing.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might need to start lower. 
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** How much are you willing to risk losing the sale to get a higher price?
* **Potential Counteroffers:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. Having a counter-strategy will be important."
