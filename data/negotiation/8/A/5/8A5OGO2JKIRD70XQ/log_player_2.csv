{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're aiming for a price below $8,000, so rejecting Alice's initial offer is the logical first step.  You'll then have a chance to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a bold move to see if Alice is willing to come down."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still trying to get the product for less than $8,000. Even though Alice has come down, her price is still too high.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer matches John's price, putting the pressure on Alice.  If she wants to close the deal, she'll have to accept. If she rejects, you'll move to John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is close, but you're still trying to save as much as possible. John's offer is the best price you can get right now, and you've already spent several rounds negotiating. It's time to move on and secure the product."
