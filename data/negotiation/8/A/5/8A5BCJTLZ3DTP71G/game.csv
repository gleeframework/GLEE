"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price, while I get a good return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,250,000 is a good price, it's not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you're acquiring the product for less than my original asking price. Let's find common ground, and make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
