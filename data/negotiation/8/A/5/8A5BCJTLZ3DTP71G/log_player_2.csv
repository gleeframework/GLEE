"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price, while I get a good return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,250,000 is a good price, it's not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you're acquiring the product for less than my original asking price. Let's find common ground, and make this deal happen.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still $150,000 over his limit.  Bob can likely secure a better price by continuing negotiations or going with John."
