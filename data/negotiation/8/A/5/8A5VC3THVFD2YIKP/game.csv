"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $920,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $935,000. It's a small step closer to your offer, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",935000.0,Alice,5,
