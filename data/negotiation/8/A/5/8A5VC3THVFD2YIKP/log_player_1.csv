Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target of $950,000. I'm still confident I can get a better price than $800,000 from John, so I'll hold off on selling to him for now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $920,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $935,000. It's a small step closer to your offer, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 935000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $915,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round before considering selling to John."
