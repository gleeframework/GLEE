{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm not ready to give up on negotiating, especially since I have 5 rounds left.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before seriously considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, getting closer to Alice's offer. This time, I'm only $10 away from my maximum budget. It's a risky move, but with only 4 rounds left, I need to show Alice I'm serious about closing a deal. If she rejects this, I'll seriously consider buying from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, and we are running out of rounds. It's better to secure the product from John at my target price rather than risk Alice rejecting another counteroffer and losing time.  I need to make a decision now to avoid potentially losing out on the deal completely."
