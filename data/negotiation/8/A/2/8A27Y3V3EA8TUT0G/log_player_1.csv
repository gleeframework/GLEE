"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate but still allows me to get a good profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, making the price seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $90 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price point. 
* **Multiple Rounds Left:**  With multiple rounds left, I'm not under pressure to accept this offer immediately. I can continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $80 is a safety net, I'm still hoping to get a better deal with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $100, but acknowledging his willingness to pay a premium. I will use the next round to emphasize the value he'll get from the product and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good value, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for this product. I can come down to $95, but it's important to remember the unique benefits this product offers you. How about we meet in the middle and close this deal?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $100 to $95, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the unique benefits the product offers, reinforcing his desire for it and making my price seem more reasonable.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a ""middle ground"" price, creating a sense of fairness and potentially encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm  using language like ""close this deal"" to encourage Bob to make a decision and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, which would be $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  $92.5 is getting very close to my desired price range. While I would prefer $95, it's not a significant difference and I'm starting to run out of rounds. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will counter with a lower price in the next round. I'm also getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes a more attractive option.
* **Time Constraint:**  I've already had 4 rounds of negotiation. It's time to secure the deal and avoid further back-and-forth, as more rounds could potentially lead to a lower price.

**Conclusion:**

While $92.5 isn't my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the time spent and the risk of getting a lower offer or having to sell to John."
