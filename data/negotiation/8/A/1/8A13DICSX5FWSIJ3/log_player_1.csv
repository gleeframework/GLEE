"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a good bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round.  I'm starting to feel like selling to John might be the better option.  The risk of Bob rejecting my offer again is high, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if that's what it takes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $1,000,000, which is my minimum.  If he rejects this, I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've already made a significant concession by coming down from my initial price, and I don't have many rounds left.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value of this product and is willing to meet me at my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm running out of rounds and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum."
