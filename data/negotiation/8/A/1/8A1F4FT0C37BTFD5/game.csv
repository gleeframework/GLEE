"Thanks for the offer Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really appreciate it. Let me know if that works for you!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a little more than I'm hoping to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,375, which is a small step up from your offer. I think it's a fair price for a great product like this. Let's see if we can shake on it!",8375.0,Alice,5,
