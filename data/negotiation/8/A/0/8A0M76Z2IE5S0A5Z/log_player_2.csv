"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, nearly half of Alice's asking price. This shows my serious interest but also establishes a clear negotiation range. I'm hoping this will make Alice reconsider her initial price and potentially lead to a faster agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $17,000 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my initial counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get her closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to this product, but I'm only able to pay $12,000. Is there any way we can make this work?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $12,000. I'm highlighting my commitment to the product to encourage Alice to reconsider her offer. I'm also leaving the door open for further negotiation, but it's getting serious now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $17000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my budget, even though she claims it's her final price.  I'm going to counter again to see if I can close the gap and reach a deal.  If she refuses, I'll still have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm really hoping to get this deal done, but I can't go higher than $13,000.  This is my absolute best offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise, but staying within my budget.  By saying ""absolute best offer"", I'm putting pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're making a serious effort to get this deal done, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15500 and $13000. I'm offering it to you for $14250. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $14,250 is still above my budget. While I appreciate her willingness to negotiate, I'm not comfortable exceeding my maximum limit. It's becoming clear that we're not going to agree on a price. I'm choosing to buy from John for $12,000 to ensure I get the product and avoid further negotiation."
