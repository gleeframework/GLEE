"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our previous customers. I believe it could be a great addition to your collection. Let me know if you're interested, and I'll share the details.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is there any flexibility on the price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet in the middle and set the price at $85? This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. Would you be willing to consider $78? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested, Bob. Let's try $82. It's a bit closer to your initial offer, but still reflects the value of the product.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $78, so how about $79? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stick to my budget.",79.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. How about we settle at $80? This brings us right to your maximum offer, and it also aligns with my target price.",80.0,Alice,7,
