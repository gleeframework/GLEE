(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, even though it's lower than the product's value to her. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can find a price point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 1050000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my budget but still a bit high. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can secure a better price.  It's still too early to consider buying from John as I might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for 1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my target price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and push the price down further.  However, I'm also starting to consider John's offer as a backup option if I can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which represents a significant move from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to move up. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at 1015000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, we are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  At this point, it's not likely I'll be able to negotiate a price lower than $1,000,000, and I'm  not willing to risk going over my target of $800,000.  Buying from John ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
