"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $11,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500?  This would still be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $12,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,250?  That way we both get a fair deal.",12250.0,Bob,4,
