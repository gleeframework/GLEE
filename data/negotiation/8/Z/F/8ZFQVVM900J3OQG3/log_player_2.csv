"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you. Given its value to you, I'm offering it at a competitive price of $1,000,000.  This price allows for both of us to profit handsomely. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still significant room for negotiation.  You have a clear goal to save as much money as possible, and 10 rounds to achieve that. Rejecting the initial offer allows you to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  This still represents a substantial profit for you and allows me to secure a better deal.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a counteroffer of $850,000 demonstrates your commitment to a lower price while still being within a reasonable range.
* **Focus on Value:** Emphasizing Alice's profit and the ""better deal"" for you helps frame the negotiation in a win-win context.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends on a positive note, signaling your willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it for $950,000. This still leaves room for both of us to make a great deal.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. 

* **Target Price:** You're aiming for $800,000.  
* **Potential Savings:** Rejecting allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** While time is running out, 7 rounds remain to close a deal that's beneficial for you.

The goal is to find the lowest possible price while still closing the deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high.  Given our previous discussions, I'm confident we can agree on $900,000. This price would allow you a significant profit while giving me the value I need. Let's bridge the gap and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Instead of a large jump, we're moving closer to Alice's offer by $50,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message highlights both parties' potential gains, reinforcing the win-win perspective.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  The mention of closing the deal adds a sense of urgency, subtly implying that you're willing to walk away if necessary."
