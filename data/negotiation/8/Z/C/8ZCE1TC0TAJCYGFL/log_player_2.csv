Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, but there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the starting point, but I'm hoping to come in a bit lower.  Given my budget and the value of the product to me, I'd like to offer $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but closer to my ideal price. I want to see if I can get it down further before resorting to John's offer.  I'm also considering the value of the product to Alice.  If I can get it down to $1,300,000 I'd be happy.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price.  However, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $1,300,000.  I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
