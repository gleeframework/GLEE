Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:**  

We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we have room to push for a better price before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $985,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to stay below the $1,000,000 mark. We've made a significant concession, and accepting now would leave a lot of potential profit on the table. We still have room to negotiate, and the risk of losing Bob at this stage seems lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's cut to the chase. I'm confident that this will more than pay for itself, and I want to give you a final offer to prove it.  $995,000.  This is my best and final offer."",
""product_price"": 995000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation window. This offer creates a sense of urgency while still leaving a small margin for Bob to potentially counter. By framing it as our ""best and final"" offer, we're increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your final offer, Alice. I'll make one last attempt to align our interests. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $990,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $990,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Time Constraint:**  We only have two rounds left, and there's no guarantee Bob will reach our desired price.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The potential gain from further negotiation is relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Strong Profit:**  $990,000 is still a significant profit margin. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk losing Bob and having to rely solely on John's offer."
