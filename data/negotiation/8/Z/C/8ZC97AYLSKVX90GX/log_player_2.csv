"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique and rare opportunity for you to acquire this item, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to resist. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further,  the offer is already within your budget and significantly cheaper than John's price.** There's no clear reason to risk losing the deal by rejecting Alice's offer."
