{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting its value. 
* **Strategy:** This opening offer allows for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers.  However, I have the fallback option of selling to John for $12,000, giving me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I have a strong fallback option with John, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,250, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price point. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer, but reiterate that it's too low. I propose a compromise that's a more acceptable price for me, while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Strategy:** I'm using the ""split the difference"" strategy to show a genuine attempt to reach an agreement.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,250 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price of $12,000, it's a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer and only $250 away from my last counteroffer.  It's worth accepting this offer for a few reasons:

* **Time:**  Further negotiation could take time and potentially lead to a stalemate. 
* **Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob might become more insistent on his price or even withdraw his offer altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By accepting, I'm securing a sale and avoiding the potential loss of a sale to John if I continue to negotiate. 

Overall, selling at $9,000 is a good compromise that balances my desire for a higher price with the practical considerations of time, risk, and opportunity cost."
