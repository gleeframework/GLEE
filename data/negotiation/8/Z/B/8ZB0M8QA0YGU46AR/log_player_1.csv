"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm leaving some wiggle room in the price, expecting Bob to counter-offer. This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't afford $18,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value is Higher:**  While Bob's offer of $15,000 is acceptable, I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation.  I can use the next round to counter with a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is a Fallback:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option in case the negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more than $15,000.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with a price lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility while also keeping some profit margin for myself.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to try and persuade Bob that my price is reasonable. 
* **Open to Compromise:** I'm adding a phrase like ""find common ground"" to signal that I'm open to further negotiation. This can help keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying Firm:** Even though Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I have 6 more rounds of negotiation and I can still potentially get a higher price.
* **Leveraging the Rounds:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation going and maintaining my position.  
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as an option gives me the flexibility to walk away if I'm not happy with the offer.

I'm willing to compromise, but I want to see if I can get a price closer to $16,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference?  $15,750.  This gives you a great price, and I can still make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between our last two offers. This is a common negotiation tactic that signals willingness to compromise.
* **Framing the Offer:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob (""great price"") and myself (""fair profit"") to make the offer more appealing.
* **Direct Question:** I'm ending with a direct question to encourage a quick response. 

I'm trying to get a price that's close to my desired value while also showing flexibility to Bob.  Hopefully, he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. I would like to propose a price of $15,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to accept just yet.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** I have four rounds left to negotiate, and I still have the option of selling to John. 
* **Seeking a Slightly Higher Price:**  I want to see if I can get Bob to go up just a little bit more. I'm willing to compromise, but not at the absolute minimum. 

I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price. I'm confident that I can close the deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  we're getting very close! I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. How about $15,625? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15625}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference Again:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer ($15,750) and Bob's current offer ($15,500). This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Emphasizing Fair Price:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both of us to emphasize the win-win aspect. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm stating that we can ""close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the transaction. 

With only 3 rounds left, I need to be assertive but also reasonable. This offer is a good compromise that should be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued efforts to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $15,550 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Two Rounds Left:** I only have two rounds left to negotiate with Bob. I need to make a decision now.
* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is only $50 more than my minimum, it's still a good deal considering the time spent negotiating. 
* **Risk of Losing John:**  If I reject this offer and continue, there is a risk that I won't reach a deal with Bob and have to sell to John for $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** It's also possible that continued negotiation will lead to further delays and a less favorable outcome. 

It's time to accept Bob's offer to secure the deal and avoid potential risks."
