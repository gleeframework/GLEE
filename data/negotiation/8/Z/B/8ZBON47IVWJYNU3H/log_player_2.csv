"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, as it's well below its true market value.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
