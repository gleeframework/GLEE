"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and your specific needs.  I'm thinking a starting price of $14,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $13,750 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still closer to the higher end of Bob's acceptable range. There's still room for negotiation to try and get the price even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While I value the product, $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
