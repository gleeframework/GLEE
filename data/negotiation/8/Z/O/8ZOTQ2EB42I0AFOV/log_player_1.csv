Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our respective positions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob seems firm at $10,500. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $500, which is better than John's offer of $10,000. It's always possible negotiations could stall, and I'd risk missing out on a deal entirely."
