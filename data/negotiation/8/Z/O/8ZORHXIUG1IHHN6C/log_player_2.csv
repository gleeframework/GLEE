**Explanation:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, she's still significantly above your absolute limit of $10,000. Her latest offer being ""final"" adds pressure, but it's a tactic.  There's no guarantee she has other buyers. 

You've made progress in the negotiation, but it's time to cut your losses. John's offer is guaranteed and saves you money."
