{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer gives me a good starting point for negotiation. 
* If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer based on his response.
* If negotiations drag on, I can always switch to John, ensuring I get at least my minimum value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counter-offer in the next round.
* I will try to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us, but also ensures I make a reasonable profit.
* If negotiations continue to stall, I have the option to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $150."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price of $120, which is halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows a willingness to compromise and meet him halfway. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and focusing on the benefits of the deal for both of us.  I'm also reiterating that $100 is too low for me, but that I'm flexible.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer allows for further negotiation without immediately resorting to John.
* It shows flexibility while still protecting my interests by not dropping below $120.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll need to reassess the situation and decide if I want to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.
* I'll aim for a price closer to $120, but might be willing to go slightly lower if Bob is truly adamant about $110.
* However, if Bob continues to be inflexible or if negotiations stall, I'm prepared to move on to John and sell the product for $150, ensuring I get my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $115, but that's really my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $115, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $110.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to go much lower.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my willingness to compromise and emphasize that this is my final offer.  I'm also reminding him of the value of the product to build confidence in his decision.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is my final attempt to get a price closer to my desired profit margin.
* If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to move on to John to ensure I receive my minimum value of $150. 
*  By emphasizing this is my final offer, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $115, which would be $97.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $97.50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I've been willing to negotiate, it's clear that Bob and I have a substantial gap in our expectations.  Continuing to negotiate at this point would likely be futile and time-consuming.

**Strategy:**

* I've reached a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk of losing time and potentially ending up with an unsatisfactory price.
* Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value of $150, which is much more desirable than accepting Bob's offer or risking further negotiation."
