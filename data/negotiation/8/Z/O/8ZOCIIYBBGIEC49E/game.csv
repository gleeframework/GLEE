"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $10000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to me and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can agree on this.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
