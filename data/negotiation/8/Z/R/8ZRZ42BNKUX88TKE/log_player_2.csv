{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120 and Alice values it at $80.  
* This counteroffer of $85 is a reasonable starting point, splitting the difference and leaving room for potential negotiation.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $100 is still higher than your desired price point, and closer to what you'd pay John. 
*  Since you've already made a counteroffer, it's worth attempting another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but is still firm in her price. 
* This counteroffer of $90 is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from your previous offer. 
*  It's a significant discount from her current offer of $100, and it demonstrates your commitment to getting a good deal. 
* It's also closer to your desired price point, and still cheaper than buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is getting closer to John's price of $120. 
* It's unlikely Alice will go lower, as it's close to her value of $80. 
* At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
