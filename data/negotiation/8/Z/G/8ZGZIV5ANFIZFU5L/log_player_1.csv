"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it really useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better starting point. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean losing money.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, he's shown willingness to negotiate. I believe there's room for a higher counteroffer that still benefits both of us.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob, as long as I don't overplay my hand and lose him completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $175, showing flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Still above minimum:**  $140 remains above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to sway him towards accepting the offer.
* **Open ended question:**  Again, asking ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to respond and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss. 
* **Potential for compromise:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for a higher counteroffer.
* **John remains a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($130) and my previous offer ($140).
* **Still above minimum:** $135 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  Using phrases like ""let's make this happen"" encourages Bob to accept and finalize the deal. 
* **Open ended question:** Asking ""Let's make this happen!"" prompts Bob to respond and potentially accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of losing value:** Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Continuing to negotiate with him risks further lowering the price.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already on Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining.  I'm running out of time to get a price I'm happy with.
* **John is a safe bet:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and a quick sale. 

Given the limited time and Bob's persistent unwillingness to meet my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a profitable outcome."
