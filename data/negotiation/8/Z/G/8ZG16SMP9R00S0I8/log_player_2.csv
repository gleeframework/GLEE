"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $22,000 is far above his budget of $8,000.  It makes more sense to try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I can offer $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still far too high.  Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. He's still well within his budget to offer a counteroffer, and buying from John is always an option if Alice doesn't come down in price."
