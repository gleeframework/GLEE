Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value and our negotiation so far. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. What are your thoughts?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000, which is the highest price I'm comfortable paying. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,700,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
