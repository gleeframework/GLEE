Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially earn more than $80 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than $80 from John, it's still below your desired earning potential. You're willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 is still lower than what you initially hoped for, it's a good compromise. It's a significant amount more than what you'd get from John, and you're likely to get the best price you're going to get from Bob."
