"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  I'll see how Bob reacts before making any further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, it's not ideal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $150. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hopefully encouraging Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not going to settle for the lowest possible offer just yet. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to meet halfway and might convince Bob to come up a little higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I want to get a bit more than $100, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and Bob's offer hasn't significantly increased. Time is running out, and I don't want to risk ending up with less than $100. I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 from John and move on."
