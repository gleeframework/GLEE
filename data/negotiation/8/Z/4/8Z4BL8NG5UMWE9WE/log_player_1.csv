Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it to Bob at $150 (its worth to John), there's a chance he'll take a slightly lower price, increasing our profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a price point that suggests a discount while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100). 
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a higher profit margin and the guaranteed $150 from John."
