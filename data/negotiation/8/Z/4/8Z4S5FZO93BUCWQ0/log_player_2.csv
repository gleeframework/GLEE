"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make me an offer or buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You know you can get the product from John for $150.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice if you reject her initial offer."
