"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering your asking price and the value I'm placing on the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still outside my budget.  To reach an agreement, I'm offering $800,000. This price is fair considering the value I place on the product and the price you're willing to sell it for. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
