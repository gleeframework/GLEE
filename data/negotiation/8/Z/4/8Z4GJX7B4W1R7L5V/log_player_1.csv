Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering your asking price and the value I'm placing on the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
