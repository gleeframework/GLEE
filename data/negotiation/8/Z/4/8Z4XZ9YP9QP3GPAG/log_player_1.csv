Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe we can negotiate a better price with Bob. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, which is a compromise for me. Can you consider this offer?

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and at $1,275,000 we're still getting a significant profit over John's offer. It's best to accept now and secure the deal."
