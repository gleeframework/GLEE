"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **You have leverage:** You know John will sell you the product for $120. This is your fallback option.
* **Potential for savings:**  Alice is starting at $100, but her product is only worth $80 to her. There's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to lower the price further, getting you a better deal."
