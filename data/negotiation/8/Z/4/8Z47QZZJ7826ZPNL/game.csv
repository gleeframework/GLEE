"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go below $125. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $122.50?",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $122.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105. It's a fair price for a product that you value at $100. Let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better than $122.50. How about we try $117.50?",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  we're getting closer! I still think $117.50 is a bit high. How about we split the difference and go with $111.25?  I'm confident we can agree on this price.",111.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer! However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I think the product is worth more than $111.25. How about we try $114.75?",114.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $114.75 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up a bit from my last offer, but I'm sticking with $113. I think this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finally close this deal.",113.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up a bit, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I think the product is worth more than $113. How about we try $116?",116.0,Alice,9,
