```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go below $125. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $122.50?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  we're getting closer! I still think $117.50 is a bit high. How about we split the difference and go with $111.25?  I'm confident we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 111.25}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still above your target of $105. You should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. Remember, you have a few rounds left and can always buy from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $114.75 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up a bit from my last offer, but I'm sticking with $113. I think this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 113}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up a bit, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I think the product is worth more than $113. How about we try $116? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. You've reached a point where Alice's offers are getting closer to your target, but they are still above your ideal price. You only have one round left.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might not accept your next counteroffer. It's better to secure the product from John at $150 and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
