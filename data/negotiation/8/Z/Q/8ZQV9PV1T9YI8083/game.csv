"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $15000, but I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10000 to me. Considering your initial offer was $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $11000 to me. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500.

"I understand that you're still hesitant, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I want to add a small condition. I'll throw in an additional service that's worth $500, which will make the total value of the deal $11500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extra service, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $11500. I'm willing to go up to $10500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,8,
