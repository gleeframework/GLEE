"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its market value.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $925,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $925,000 is a fair price, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about we settle on $940,000? It's a small compromise on both sides and will allow us to close this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $940,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
