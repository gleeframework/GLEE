Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you would be very interested in.  It's worth $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  This is a fantastic price, as you'd be getting a great deal.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $10,000. This is a compromise between my minimum value ($15,000) and Bob's maximum value ($8,000).  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential for a good deal for Bob. It doesn't explicitly state my minimum value, but subtly hints at it by mentioning that the product is worth $15,000 to me.  This could encourage Bob to accept a higher price.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximizing Profits:**  This offer gives me a good chance of getting a price closer to my ideal value. While I'm willing to accept $10,000, Bob might be motivated to pay closer to $15,000 due to the value he perceives. 
* **No Risk:**  I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price. This allows me to negotiate with Bob without the pressure of a ""take it or leave it"" situation.
* **Building a Relationship:** A positive message can potentially build a better relationship with Bob, even if he doesn't buy this time. This could lead to future sales or referrals."
