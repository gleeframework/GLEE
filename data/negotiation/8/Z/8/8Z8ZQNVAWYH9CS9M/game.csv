"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $125 is still a bit more than I want to pay. I'm willing to pay $110, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to reach a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob! I understand that $125 was still a bit high for you. I'm willing to come down another $5 and sell it to you for $120. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
