"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is $90 and Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $80, it's in his best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money and get the product for as close to his maximum price of $80 as possible. While Alice's offer of $82.50 is closer, it's still over his target. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $82.50 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is fair for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that low. I'll meet you at $81, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $81 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $80, but it's still over his target. He has already rejected several offers and has only a few rounds left. It's likely that the negotiation will continue to be a back-and-forth with Alice refusing to drop her price to $80. 

Considering the limited time, and the fact that Bob can buy the same product from John for $80, it's more efficient to  ""BuyFromJhon"" to secure the product at his desired price without risking further negotiation delays."
