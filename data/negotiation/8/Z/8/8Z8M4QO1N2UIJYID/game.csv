"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $775,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a little ways off from my target price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $790,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",790000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $790,000. Would you consider $782,500? I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",782500.0,Bob,6,
