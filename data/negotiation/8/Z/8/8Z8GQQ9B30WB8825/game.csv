"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $14000. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I can meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I have another buyer who is willing to pay the full price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
