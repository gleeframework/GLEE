Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I believe we can find a price that benefits us both.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that gives us both room to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still feeling a little stretched at $1,300,000.  Would you consider $1,250,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still hesitant to accept. My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  With 6 rounds left, I have time to see if we can reach an agreement."
