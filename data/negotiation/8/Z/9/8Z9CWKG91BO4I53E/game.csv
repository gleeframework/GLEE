"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you be open to $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, which is $1,012,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
