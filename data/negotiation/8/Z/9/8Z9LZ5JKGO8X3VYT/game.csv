"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair market value for this product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm going to need to come in a bit lower to make this work for me.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a significant price reduction, but I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $1,050,000.  That's a significant compromise for me, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $1,062,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs and allows us to reach an agreement.",1062500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,062,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,062,500, which would be $1,068,750. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",1068750.0,Alice,7,
