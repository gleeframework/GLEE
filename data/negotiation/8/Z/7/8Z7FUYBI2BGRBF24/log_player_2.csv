"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

While $12,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Alice seems eager to sell, and we might be able to get it for even less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident in the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from using it.

Alice is negotiating, but we're still aiming for a lower price. It's worth another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice is signaling that $11,000 is her bottom line.  While we could push for a slightly lower price, the difference is now relatively small. It's better to secure a good deal at $11,000 than risk losing the opportunity and having to pay $15,000 to John."
