"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that price point be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
