Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget.  While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this product a great value."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your understanding. I would like to propose a price of $90, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $100, Bob has made it clear that he's not going to budge on his price.  Accepting his offer of $90 is the best option available right now. It's still more than what he initially offered, and I'll avoid the risk of losing him as a buyer altogether."
