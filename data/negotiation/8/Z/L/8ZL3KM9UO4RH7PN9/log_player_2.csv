"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.** This means you have no room to save money if you accept.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.**  Even if you don't succeed, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering Alice a price that's slightly above her own valuation, which is $12,000. This gives her a little bit of profit, making the offer potentially appealing.
* At the same time, it's significantly lower than my maximum budget of $15,000, giving me a considerable saving.
* This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation.  If Alice rejects it, I can still lower the price further, but it's a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now below my maximum price point ($15,000).** This means I can save money by accepting.
* **Rejecting again and counter-offering might lead to a further price reduction, but it's a risk.** There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, and I could end up paying the same amount or even more to John. 
* **The $14,000 price is a reasonable compromise, allowing me to save $1,000 compared to buying from John.**"
