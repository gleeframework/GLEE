Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and significantly higher than my minimum. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is tempting, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob.  $850,000 is close to my minimum, but I believe I can do better.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $875,000 as it's a good deal for me, considering the time we have left and the risk of losing the deal with John."
