"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and significantly higher than my minimum. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is tempting, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
