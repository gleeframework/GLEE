Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to you.  What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your budget, but I need to be a little higher than $1,350,000 to make this work for me.  Let's compromise at $1,450,000. It's a fair price, and it gets us both closer to our goals.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm not quite ready to accept $1,400,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,425,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,425,000. Accepting this offer gets you the product for $75,000 less than John's price, which is a good deal.  Continuing to negotiate might save you a little more, but it also risks Alice walking away."
