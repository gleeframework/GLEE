Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe the product is worth it. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price or go with John's offer of $800,000. This initial high offer sets the bar and hopefully gets Bob thinking about the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that Bob finds appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a decent compromise, and I'm happy to accept it. It's above my minimum threshold, and  I'm satisfied with the outcome."
