Alice's offer is still too high, but it's closer to my budget.  I'll reject it and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, I'm concerned that Alice might not be willing to go any lower.  It's safer to go with Jhon's offer and secure the product for my budget."
