"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), you create room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Anchoring:**  This high initial offer acts as an anchor, influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and potentially making your subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states your willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility while maintaining a strong initial stance.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This indicates there's room for further negotiation. You're aiming to maximize your profit, and accepting his first counteroffer might leave money on the table. 

By rejecting and entering the next round, you can:

* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:**  See how much he's willing to move from his initial counteroffer.
* **Maintain a strong position:** Show that you're not desperate to sell below a certain threshold.

You still have the security of John's offer if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're showing flexibility by lowering your price, but the decrease is substantial enough to demonstrate seriousness while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reinforces the product's value, aiming to shift Bob's focus away from his initial perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The counteroffer keeps the price well above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,100,000. I'd like to make a more substantial counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob significantly increased his offer to $1,600,000, which is a positive sign. However, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While John's offer is becoming more tempting, Bob's willingness to move suggests there's still potential for a deal above your minimum. 

By rejecting and entering the next round, you can:

* **Test Bob's limits:** See if he's willing to cross the $1,600,000 mark.
* **Potentially secure a higher price:**  Even a small increase from Bob would be more profitable than selling to John.

You're walking a fine line here, but the potential for a higher payout with Bob makes it worth continuing the negotiation for at least one more round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your revised offer demonstrates serious interest, and I want to find a way for us to reach an agreement.  However, I can't go below $1,950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer signals a degree of finality, applying pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The price is slightly above your minimum acceptable amount, giving you a small buffer while still aiming for a price Bob might realistically accept.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value aims to sway Bob one last time.
* **Time Constraint:** With only five rounds remaining, it's crucial to push towards a conclusion. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, the risk of losing both deals might make selling to John the safer option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I see in the product and is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, securing a substantial profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling completely. The longer the negotiation drags on, the higher the chance of losing both deals.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you might be able to extract a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal entirely increases. It's unlikely Bob will suddenly jump to a much higher offer.

This decision represents a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal within the remaining time."
