"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,100,000. I'd like to make a more substantial counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I see in the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your revised offer demonstrates serious interest, and I want to find a way for us to reach an agreement.  However, I can't go below $1,950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique value this product offers.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I see in the product and is a fair price for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
