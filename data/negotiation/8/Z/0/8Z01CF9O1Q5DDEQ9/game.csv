"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer, I'm still looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $775,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both get a good deal.  What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
