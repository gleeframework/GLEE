Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is a good midpoint between my minimum acceptable price ($80) and Bob's estimated value ($150). 
* **Room for negotiation:** This gives room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial deal.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing that I have a fallback option with John at $80, I can be more confident in pushing for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher value:** While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's potential to get closer to my ideal price point. 
* **Room to negotiate:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially pushing him closer to $120 or finding a compromise.
* **Risk assessment:**  While selling to John for $80 is always an option, I'm not desperate enough to accept a deal that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $110? That's still a good value for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $120 to $110, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain value:** This offer still brings me closer to my desired price point, and it's still significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Clear communication:** I'm explaining why this is a good deal for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
