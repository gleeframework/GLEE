"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $120 is better than John's price of $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $110? That's still a good value for you, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price of $150 and closer to Bob's target of $100.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to save money and avoid further negotiation."
