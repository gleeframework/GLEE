"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's true value ($8,000).  As Bob, I want to maximize my savings.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would be a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial valuation of $12,000 and closer to his desired price point.  While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk of Alice walking away and potentially driving the price up later. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without the risk of losing it."
