"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would be a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
