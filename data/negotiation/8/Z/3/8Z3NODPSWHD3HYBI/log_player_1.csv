Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit.  I'm aware that Bob might reject this, but I'm confident in the product's value and I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also keeping John as a backup in case the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still a good profit for me and a more realistic price for Bob, considering his offer. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell for more, it's better to secure a deal at this price than to risk further negotiations and potentially lose both Bob and John as buyers."
