Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my original asking price with Bob, it's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  I've already spent a significant amount of time negotiating, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John at least guarantees me my minimum value."
