"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $109. This way we both get a good deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
