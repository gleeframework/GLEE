**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $85 is close to my maximum budget, it's still slightly higher. Since John is willing to sell the product for $80, it's worth trying to see if I can get Alice to accept my final offer of $80.  If not, I'll go with John's offer."

I really appreciate your flexibility.  $85 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80.
