Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point.  I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $13,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,200. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum selling price of $12,000, and it's only $200 less than what I could get from John. There are only 6 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob.  This is a good compromise and I'm confident I can't get a better deal."
