"Alice,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $750,000 right now. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $750,000 is a good start, I'm still looking for something closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
