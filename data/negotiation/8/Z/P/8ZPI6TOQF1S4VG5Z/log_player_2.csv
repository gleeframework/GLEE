You are still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get closer to your goal of $95 by making another counteroffer."

Alice has come down to $105, which is within your budget and a decent deal.  While you could keep negotiating, there's a chance you could lose the deal entirely.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
