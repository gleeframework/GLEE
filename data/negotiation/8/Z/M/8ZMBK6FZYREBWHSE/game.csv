"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my final offer, I'm not going any higher than this.",13000.0,Alice,5,
