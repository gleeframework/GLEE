Round 5
Alice's offer:

We're still quite a ways off from a reasonable price. Let's see if we can nudge Alice further down."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already come down a bit from my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. How about we try $12,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still trying to inch the price up. We haven't reached a point where buying from John is the better option, so we'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $12,750 is still pushing it for me. How about we settle at $11,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 11750
}
``` 

We're inching our offer up slightly to show willingness to compromise, but we're still holding firm below $12,000. We have a few rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Can you live with that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This seems like the best we can do with Alice. She's come down quite a bit, and we're getting a decent deal compared to John's offer. It's always possible to haggle more, but the difference is getting small enough that it's probably not worth the risk of her backing out."
