Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to me is significant, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $1150000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,150,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a fair compromise and a good deal for me.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and it's time to close this deal."
