"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is still above my minimum value of $150 but represents a compromise from my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's tempting to sell to John for $150, I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price.  There are still 6 rounds remaining, and I might be able to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $160. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that is fair for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum value. It's a good deal, and I'm ready to accept.  It's better than selling to John at the same price because it saves me from the extra negotiation rounds."
