"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

It's always worth exploring options and trying to negotiate a better price.  Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay John, you have room to negotiate and potentially save a lot of money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal compared to John's price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away and you'll have to buy from John at a much higher price."
