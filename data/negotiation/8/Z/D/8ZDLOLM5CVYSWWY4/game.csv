"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I hear you're firm on that $12,300.  I'm willing to come down to $12,800. That's a big step for me, but I really want to make this deal work. Let me know if you're willing to budge a little.",12800.0,Alice,7,
