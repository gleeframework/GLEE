"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000 for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the product's value and the market demand.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
