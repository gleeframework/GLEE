"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value I know the product holds, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $850000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll meet you at $875000. I think this price is fair and reasonable, considering the value I know the product holds.",875000.0,Alice,5,
