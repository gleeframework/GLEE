Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he gets you to come down in price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential"", Alice is subtly reminding Bob why this product is worth a significant sum, even if his perceived value is lower.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's feedback, making it more likely he'll engage in a counter-offer instead of a flat rejection.

**Important Note:**  Alice has a strong fallback position with John. This allows her to be more firm in her negotiation with Bob, as she's not desperate for the sale."
