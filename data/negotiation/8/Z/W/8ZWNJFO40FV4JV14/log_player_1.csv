Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and you'll greatly benefit from it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility on price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secured buyer (John) at $10,000, so you can afford to be a bit more ambitious in your initial offer to Bob. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still being aware of Bob's valuation and your fallback option."
