"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that still allows you a decent profit.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a substantial discount from my initial offer. This price gives you a good profit margin while ensuring I can meet my minimum requirements. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,
