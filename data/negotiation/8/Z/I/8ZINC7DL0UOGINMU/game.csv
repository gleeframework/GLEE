"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good investment.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $1900000. This takes into account your interest and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1900000. How about $1850000?",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. $1850000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference again.  How about $1875000? This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",1875000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1880000. Can we meet at this price?",1880000.0,Bob,6,
