Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 
While $1,880,000 is still below my initial price target, it's getting closer to what I'm hoping for. With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 would be a significant loss compared to Bob's offer. It's time to take the deal."
