,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13000. This is a great compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11500. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $12800, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $12000. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, which is a slight increase from your offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
