"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000.  This price still reflects the substantial value this product offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
