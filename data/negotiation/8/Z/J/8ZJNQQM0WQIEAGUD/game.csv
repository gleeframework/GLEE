"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value.

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $850,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $750,000, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize getting the best possible price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth and is still a good deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good price, and I'm still interested in purchasing the product. However, $825,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price considering my valuation of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
