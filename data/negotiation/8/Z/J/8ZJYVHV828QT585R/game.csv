"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but still a reasonable compromise considering the value I place on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still too far from what I can afford. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that this price is fair considering your value for the product and my budget constraints. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1,050,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price for the product, but $1,050,000 is still pushing my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the fact that I'm ready to make a purchase now. Let's try to work out a deal that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, which would be $1,012,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,012,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $990,000, which is very close to your last offer and represents a significant compromise on my part. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement.  Let's close this deal!",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get at least $1,025,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
