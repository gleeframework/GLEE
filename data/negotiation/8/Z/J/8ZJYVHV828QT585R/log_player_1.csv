Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.
