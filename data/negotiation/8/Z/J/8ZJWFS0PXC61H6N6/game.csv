"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
