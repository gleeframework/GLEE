{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also keeping in mind my ""Plan B"" with John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```
 
I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise that hopefully bridges the gap between our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11250}
