"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we start at $8500? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than you're willing to go, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8000 either. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500, but I'm still a bit higher than I want to be.  Let's split the difference at $9000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10000, which is $9500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to hold firm on it.",9500.0,Alice,5,
