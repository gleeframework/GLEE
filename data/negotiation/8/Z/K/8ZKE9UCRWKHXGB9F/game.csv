"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I'm asking for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $6,500 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To make this work, I could come down to $11,500. This is a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a solution for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that the product has a high market value, but I need to stick to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've received a firm offer from another buyer for $10,000. To be completely transparent, I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to be realistic. I can let go of the product for $10,500 â€“ my final offer.  This is a limited-time opportunity, as I need to make a decision soon.",10500.0,Alice,5,
