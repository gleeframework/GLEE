"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I'm asking for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** While the price is high, I frame it as ""fair"" and highlight the product's ""value and potential.""  This aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Open Communication:**  I end with an open question to encourage Bob's engagement and understand his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly below both my minimum and his stated value. This suggests he has room to move. By rejecting this low offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage him to negotiate more realistically. I'm confident I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $6,500 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To make this work, I could come down to $11,500. This is a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a solution for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection and Justification:** I start by clearly rejecting Bob's low offer while acknowledging his interest. I then provide a reason for the rejection, stating it's ""significantly below market value."" This reinforces my position and manages his expectations.
* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** I make a substantial reduction from $13,500 to $11,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate but keeps me well above both my minimum and his initial offer. 
* **Framing as Win-Win:**  I emphasize this as a ""compromise"" and highlight my ""desire to find a solution."" This encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable offer while maintaining a positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has a high market value, but I need to stick to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $7,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss. I need to demonstrate that I'm firm on my value.  It's now time to use the leverage of my guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've received a firm offer from another buyer for $10,000. To be completely transparent, I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to be realistic. I can let go of the product for $10,500 â€“ my final offer.  This is a limited-time opportunity, as I need to make a decision soon."", ""product_price"": 10500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing John:** I bring in the offer from John, subtly leveraging it as pressure. By stating I ""received a firm offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Honesty and Preference:** I maintain a positive and transparent approach, telling Bob I ""prefer"" to work with him. This helps preserve the relationship even while applying pressure.
* **Final Offer with Time Limit:** I present $10,500 as my ""final offer,"" emphasizing that it's a limited-time opportunity. This encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially prevents the negotiation from stalling. 
* **Slight Concession:**  While close to my minimum, I offer a small discount ($500) from John's offer to incentivize Bob and signal that this is genuinely my best price."
