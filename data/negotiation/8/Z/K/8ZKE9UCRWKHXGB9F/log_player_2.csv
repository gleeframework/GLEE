Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $6,500?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $6,500 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To make this work, I could come down to $11,500. This is a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a solution for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've received a firm offer from another buyer for $10,000. To be completely transparent, I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to be realistic. I can let go of the product for $10,500 â€“ my final offer.  This is a limited-time opportunity, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk the negotiations failing and potentially missing out entirely."
