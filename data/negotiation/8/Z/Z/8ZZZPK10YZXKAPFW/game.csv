"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you and allows me to achieve a good return. I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any concerns.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price. However, $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum. If you're serious about buying, let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
