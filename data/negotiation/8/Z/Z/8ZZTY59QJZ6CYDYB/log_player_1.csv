Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already making a profit of $2,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to $12,000. 
* **It sets a clear expectation:** This lets Bob know you're serious about getting a good price, but you're also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum threshold of $8,000.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob, potentially getting closer to your desired price.  There's also a chance that Bob will raise his offer if he's truly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly what John is willing to pay.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will go higher. Accepting this offer ensures you get your minimum desired price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that could lead to no deal."
