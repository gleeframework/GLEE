Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a strong offer:** It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's maximum value, giving him incentive to counter. 
* **It's optimistic:** It aims for a good profit, but allows you to back down if necessary. 

Remember, you can always adjust this offer depending on how the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's still above your minimum, it's far below your initial offer and the product's true value to Bob. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob clearly sees value in the product, and is willing to pay a significant sum. This means there's likely more room to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** You want to maximize your profit.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to counter Bob's offer. You could:

* **Meet halfway:** Offer $1,100,000. This shows you're willing to compromise while still getting a good price.
* **Slightly lower:** Offer $1,050,000, as a starting point for further negotiation.
* **Be firm:**  Counter with $1,150,000, demonstrating that you value the product highly. 

Remember, your goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of you!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is exactly halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling you're serious about reaching an agreement while still maximizing your profit.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, suggesting that a lower price would be unfair. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, making it more likely for Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**  

Now, wait for Bob's response. Be prepared to either accept his next offer, counter with another offer, or sell to John if the negotiations stall.  Remember, you want to be flexible but also ensure you receive a price that's fair for you!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this is a price you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $50,000 below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  There's a good chance Bob won't budge further, and you could end up selling to John for $800,000. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Accepting this offer could lead to future business opportunities with Bob.

**Next Steps:**  

You can now finalize the sale with Bob and secure a profit of $250,000. It's important to remember that while a higher price would have been ideal, it's better to secure a deal at a slightly lower price than to risk getting nothing at all."
