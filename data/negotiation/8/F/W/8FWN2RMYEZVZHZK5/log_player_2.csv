Alice's offer is close to my maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price.

While $10,000 is a better price, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get it even closer to $9,000."
