"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still below the product's worth to Bob ($1,000,000) and my minimum value ($1,000,000). I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore it further. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm unable to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. I hope this suggestion will lead us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum value of $1,000,000 and is also within the product's worth to him. While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob. Accepting his offer guarantees me a good profit, and it's safer than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
