"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm unable to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. I hope this suggestion will lead us closer to reaching an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
