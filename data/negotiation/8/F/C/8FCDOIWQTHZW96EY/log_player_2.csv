"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a better price than buying from John for $12,000. 
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his next counteroffer, and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids potential delays or further negotiations."
