Alice's offer is still too high.  I'd rather keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  I'm still willing to pay $105 and am not going to jump to $135 just yet."

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'm not comfortable spending more than $105, and I know I can get it from John for $100. It's time to end the negotiation and go with the sure thing."
