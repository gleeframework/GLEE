# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product.

We propose to offer you this remarkable product at a special price of $950,000. This is a generous offer that reflects both the quality of the product and its significance to you. We believe this price provides a fair balance between the value we place on the product and the value it brings to you. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this offer. We are confident that you will find this investment to be highly rewarding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's value to her ($800,000). Her message is full of fluff designed to make you think the product is worth more than it is to her.
* You have a backup option with John at $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to overpay.  
* There's a good chance Alice will come back with a lower offer closer to her true valuation to avoid losing the sale."
