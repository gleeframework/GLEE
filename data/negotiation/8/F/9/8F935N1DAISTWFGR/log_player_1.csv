"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is above my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's also a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum value, I'm not going to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my starting price and Bob's offer, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a decent compromise and is only slightly below my counteroffer. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk going further and potentially ending up with John's offer of $120."
