"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages that I believe justify a higher price point. Would you consider $1,130,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1130000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,130,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1090000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000, which is a bit above my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. Can we meet at this price?",1070000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've been trying to find a middle ground here, but I have to be honest, your last offer is a significant step back from where we were. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,085,000.
