Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. This gives you leverage to aim much higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer ($1,500,000), you anchor the negotiation at a point favorable to you. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for a potentially higher final price.
* **One-Shot Deal:** The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach creates a sense of urgency and limits Bob's ability to negotiate you down. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You get $500,000 more than your guaranteed price.
* **Bob rejects:**  You still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, meeting your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing risk."
