"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm aiming to get as much value as possible, and a high initial offer often sets a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming to find a compromise point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering $15,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly higher than what John is offering.  I'm confident I can use the extra $1,500 to my advantage."
