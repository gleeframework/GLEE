"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking $1500000 for it.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the value. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the unique product. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $950000 if possible.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $950000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1200000?  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my budget and the market value, I believe we're still quite far apart. I'd like to propose an offer of $1050000. This is the highest I can go while still making sure I can afford other expenses. I hope this might be a starting point for further discussion.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
