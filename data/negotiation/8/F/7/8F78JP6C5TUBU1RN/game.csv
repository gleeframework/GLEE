"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,400,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,300,000. This is a reasonable price that should be more acceptable to you, and it's getting closer to my target. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
