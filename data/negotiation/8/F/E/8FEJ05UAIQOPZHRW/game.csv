"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8250. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $8250 is a bit steep. How about $7800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to my price, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $8100. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair deal.",8100.0,Alice,5,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm really struggling to justify $8050. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7500 and $8050, which would be $7775. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7775.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8000.
