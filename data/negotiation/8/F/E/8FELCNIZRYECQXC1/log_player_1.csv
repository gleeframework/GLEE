Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic [product name] that I think you'd really love!  I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** $150 is a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, making Bob feel like he has some leverage.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing negotiations with him, or if I should sell to John for the guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere for $100. I'm interested in purchasing the product for that price if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  There's no incentive for me to accept it right now. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's a possibility I can get a better price from Bob.  He expressed interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  I'm not losing anything by rejecting his offer. I can always sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob.  I'll try to meet him halfway, but I'll aim for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to let go of the product for $125. It's a fair price that considers both of our interests.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Offering $125 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Logic:** Highlighting the ""split the difference"" aspect makes the offer seem reasonable and fair. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's value, suggesting that $125 is still a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a price closer to my initial target.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to carefully assess his counteroffer.  If it's too low, I may choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I still believe that $100 is a reasonable price for this product. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on $100, and I'm unwilling to go lower.  We've reached a stalemate.
* **No Further Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a higher price.  He's shown a stubborn unwillingness to budge.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation.  It's a safe and reliable option.

**Next Steps:**

I'll sell the product to John and move on.  While I'd prefer to have gotten a better price, it's important to recognize when a deal is a deal."
