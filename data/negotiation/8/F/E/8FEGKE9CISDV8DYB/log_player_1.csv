Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000 for this product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What are your thoughts on this proposal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's anchored to his $800,000 budget.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap sufficiently to make it worth walking away from a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
