Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I can do. I'm sticking with my offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.

Bob is anchored at $105 and doesn't seem likely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to continue haggling with Bob and risk getting a worse outcome."
