"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking of offering $1200000 for it. Would you be willing to accept this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I think this price reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $1500000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1700000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1600000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1650000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1650000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm starting to feel like we're not quite meeting in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to ask you to reconsider and see if we can find a better price. Can you think about meeting me at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1625000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1625000. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement at this price.",1625000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet on price. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product, which is as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000. Please let me know if you're willing to accept my final offer.",1600000.0,Bob,10,
