"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while and I know it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $9000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and gives me a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
