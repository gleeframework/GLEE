# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no benefit to accepting her offer as you can get the same product from John for the same price.  You should reject Alice's offer and then buy the product from John."
