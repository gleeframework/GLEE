"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. I understand the value of the product, but your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I could potentially stretch to $700,000.  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting my financial limits. Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a significant compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the product's value to you. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
