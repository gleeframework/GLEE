Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that's significantly higher than what John would pay but leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still leaves room for potential compromise. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where both of us are satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price,  Bob's offer is a good compromise and ensures a better profit than selling to John."
