"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, I still believe it's worth more than $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a bit more commitment. I'll consider a price of $1325000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting it if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1310000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. I'll consider a price of $1320000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, and I expect you to meet me at this price or walk away.",1320000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last push, but I need to see a bit more commitment from you. I'll consider a price of $1315000, but that's it. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for the minimum price of $1200000.",1315000.0,Alice,9,
