"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $700,000?  I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, but $700,000 is still below my minimum. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I understand this is your bottom line, how about we split the difference and settle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I can go.",875000.0,Alice,7,
