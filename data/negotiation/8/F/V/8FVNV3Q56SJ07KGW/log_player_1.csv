Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a more than fair price."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** By starting high at $1,500,000, you emphasize the product's value and leave room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts, you earn an extra $500,000.  If he rejects, you still meet your minimum with John. 

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on maximizing potential profit. It assumes Bob doesn't know about your guaranteed offer from John."
