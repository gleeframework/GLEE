"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to you. Considering its value and quality, I would like to propose a price of $135 for it. This offer allows us both to benefit - you get a great deal on a valuable item, and I receive a fair compensation for my product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer of $135 is lower than John's $150, her messaging is manipulative. She tries to inflate the product's worth to you ($150) when you clearly stated your limit is $150. This suggests she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting her offer, you signal you're not easily swayed and open the door for a potential counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
