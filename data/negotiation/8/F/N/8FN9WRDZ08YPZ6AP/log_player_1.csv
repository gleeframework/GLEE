"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value you're putting on it, but given my budget, I'd like to propose a price closer to $8000. I believe this aligns better with what I can afford right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum, it's still too low to maximize my potential earnings. I believe there's still room for negotiation and a higher price.
* **Exploring Options:** Rejecting this offer allows me to counteroffer and explore if there's a middle ground Bob is willing to meet. 
* **Not Rushing:**  I'm not in a desperate position to sell. By rejecting, I'm keeping my options open and increasing the possibility of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which I believe is fair considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price of $10,000, but I'm still staying above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Finding Common Ground:** The message is phrased to encourage continued negotiation and a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to $8500. This seems to be a reasonable compromise given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, I need to weigh the risk of continuing negotiation against the potential gain. 
* **No Guarantee of Higher Price:** There's no guarantee that Bob will continue to raise his offer, and I risk losing him altogether. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $8,000 is a solid safety net, so I'm not taking a significant risk by accepting Bob's offer. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale close to my minimum and eliminates further negotiation risks."
