"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's make this simple â€“ $810,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",810000.0,Alice,5,
