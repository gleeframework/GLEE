Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but lower than my own minimum value of $12,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I get my minimum value. This strategy maximizes my chances of selling the product at a higher price while still having a backup plan."
