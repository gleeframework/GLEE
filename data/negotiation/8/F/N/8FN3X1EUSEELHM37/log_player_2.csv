"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product. Alice's offer is $110, which is more than your maximum.  You can get the product from John for $100, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
