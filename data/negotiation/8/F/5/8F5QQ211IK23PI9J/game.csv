"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still significantly higher than what I'd get elsewhere. Let's work together to make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,100,000 is just a little too low for me right now.  How about $1,125,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too far below what I need.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $1,100,000?  That's a significant step closer to my initial offer and still a very good deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
