Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still significantly higher than what I'd get elsewhere. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is still a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. I have 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,100,000 is just a little too low for me right now.  How about $1,125,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm still not convinced I've gotten the best deal possible. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price. I'm confident that I can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too far below what I need.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $1,100,000?  That's a significant step closer to my initial offer and still a very good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get closer to my desired price with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing any more time.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a good safety net, and it's better than risking further negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
