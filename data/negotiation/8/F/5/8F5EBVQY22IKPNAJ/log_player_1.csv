"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his upper limit might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I want to see if I can push for more.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this will entice him to close the deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm confident in the value of the product and think I can push for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is another step closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this offer is reasonable, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum price, but with only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to risk further negotiation.  It's not guaranteed that Bob will accept my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure sale to John.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the safest option.  I'm guaranteed to get a decent return, and it's better than potentially getting nothing if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
