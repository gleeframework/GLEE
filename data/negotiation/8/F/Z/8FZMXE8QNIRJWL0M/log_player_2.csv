Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you be open to $1,150,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,150,000 is still below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This offer reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
