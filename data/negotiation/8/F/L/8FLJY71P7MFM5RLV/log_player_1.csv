{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than $8,000, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? That would be a great compromise for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$8,800 is closer to my minimum desired price of $8,000. While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking a deal with Bob and having to settle with John for $8,000."
