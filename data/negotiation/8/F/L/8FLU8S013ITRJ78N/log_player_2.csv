Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $130 for it?"", ""product_price"": 130}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more for this product.  How about $140?  It's a fair price for the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
