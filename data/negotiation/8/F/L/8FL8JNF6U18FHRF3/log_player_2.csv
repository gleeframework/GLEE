Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $10,200, which is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not going any lower.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $10,200.  Since John offers the product for $10,000, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
