"I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $100 for it right now.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140, but that's as low as I can go.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product,  which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $135, which is my best price at this point.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, which would be a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $145. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. I'm willing to hold out for that price.",145.0,Alice,7,
