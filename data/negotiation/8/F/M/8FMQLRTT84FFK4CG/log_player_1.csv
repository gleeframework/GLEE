"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I'm confident it would be incredibly valuable to your operations. I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000.  I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and our minimum ($1,500,000). This establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential ROI, aiming to justify the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer to be higher than it would be otherwise. 

**Important Note:** While we have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, we aim to maximize profit.  It's too early in the negotiation to settle for our minimum price."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $2,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is higher than our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), it's still significantly lower than our initial ask. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Maintain negotiating power:**  Accepting immediately might signal desperation and limit our potential for a higher price.
* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:**  His counteroffer suggests genuine interest, but we need to see how flexible he is.

We are still within the early rounds, and the gap between his offer and our desired price is negotiable. We will aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting your counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential this product holds for your business.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to part with it for $2,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but not too much):** We reduce our asking price by $200,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is not drastic, demonstrating that we still value the product highly.
* **Reiteration of Value:**  We continue to emphasize the product's potential benefits to Bob's business, subtly justifying the price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The language emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" and a ""fair deal,"" encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to pay $2,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** Bob's offer of $2,050,000 is significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and represents a strong profit. 
* **Positive Negotiation Trend:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating genuine interest and willingness to find a compromise.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk alienating Bob or result in smaller incremental gains. It's often better to secure a good deal than risk losing it by pushing too hard. 

While we could aim for a slightly higher price, the risk of jeopardizing the deal outweighs the potential reward at this point. Accepting Bob's offer secures a substantial profit and concludes the negotiation successfully."
