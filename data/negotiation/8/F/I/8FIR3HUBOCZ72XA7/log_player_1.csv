""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a product I know you'll find immensely valuable. Given its unique benefits and your specific needs, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm offering it at a price of $1,300,000. This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after which I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Higher Valuation:**  We know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,500,000) than our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This allows us to aim for a much higher sale price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 positions it as a premium offering while still providing substantial value to Bob (a saving of $200,000). 
* **Time Constraint:**  Introducing a 24-hour deadline adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly. This reduces the risk of losing him and having to settle for the guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While we could aim even higher, going too close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) might make him balk and could result in losing the sale altogether.  

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
