"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, as you know this product is worth at least that much to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, it's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John if you can't get a better deal from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,250,000? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of this product. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's getting closer. Since John is selling the product for $1,200,000, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
