"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's closer to my maximum than her minimum, leaving little room for negotiation in my favor. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a good amount above her perceived value. This leaves room for further negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down slightly, but it's still closer to my maximum budget. I need to push for a lower price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That seems fair."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

I'm proposing a compromise by suggesting the middle ground between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
