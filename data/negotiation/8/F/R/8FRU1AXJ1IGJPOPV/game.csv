"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1100000 is closer to my range, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably commit to right now.  I'm willing to offer $1050000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your initial offer and your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering you the product for $1080000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but still reflects the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
