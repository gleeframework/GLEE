"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work for me. Would you be willing to consider that figure?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
