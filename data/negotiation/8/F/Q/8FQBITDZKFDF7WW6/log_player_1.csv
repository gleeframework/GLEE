Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. While my asking price is $1,150,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that feels right for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John offers a safe $1,200,000, there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes flexibility and a desire to find a mutually beneficial deal. This encourages Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** The fact that John exists isn't explicitly stated.  It's information Alice holds to potentially use later in the negotiation if needed."
