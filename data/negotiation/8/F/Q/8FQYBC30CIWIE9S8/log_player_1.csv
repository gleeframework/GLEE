Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth. Let's compromise again. How about $850,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $837,500 is still a bit low. How about we settle on $845,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 845000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we make one final push to close this out? I'm willing to offer $840,000. This is a very competitive offer and saves us both from further negotiation.

While I'd love to push for more, I've been negotiating for 8 rounds already. It's getting close to the deadline, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer of $840,000 is the best option at this point."
