Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, hoping to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible. I believe this is a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe I can still get closer to his perceived value of $80 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering $85 in this round. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's last offer. I hope to reach an agreement with Bob at this price, but I'm still open to negotiating further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $80. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price that John is willing to pay. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I don't see a reason to continue negotiating further."
