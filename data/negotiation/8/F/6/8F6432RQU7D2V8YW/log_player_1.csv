Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This offer represents a fair balance between our respective needs.  Let's make this happen.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I would have preferred to close with Bob, I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting too close to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal by continuing to haggle. John is offering my minimum, so I'll go with that."
