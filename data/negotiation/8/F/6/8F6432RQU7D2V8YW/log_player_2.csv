Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal!
