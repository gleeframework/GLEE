"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows both of us to benefit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  This represents a considerable investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This offer represents a fair balance between our respective needs.  Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,
