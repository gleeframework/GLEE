``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price than I would from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $10000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $9500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject this offer and make one final counteroffer. I'm hoping Bob will realize that I'm not willing to go any lower, and he will accept my final offer."
