{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for potential counteroffers and profit for you.

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering a price that is above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum value ($15,000).
* This allows for negotiation and a potential win-win situation. 
* If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I cannot accept an offer that is less than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my goal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and try to get closer to my desired outcome.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm trying to meet halfway:** By offering $11,000, I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000).
* **I'm still above my minimum:**  $11,000 is higher than my minimum value of $15,000, so I'm not losing money.
* **I'm expressing my willingness to negotiate:** I'm showing Bob that I'm open to finding a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still less than my minimum of $15,000.
* **I'm hoping for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always opt to sell to John for my minimum value."
