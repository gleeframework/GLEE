"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by previous customers. I believe it could be very beneficial for you. Let's start with a price of $120. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than Alice's initial value of $150, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80.  Rejecting allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is firm on his budget. The message is friendly but firm, emphasizing a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given your valuation of the product, I propose a price of $95. This is higher than your offer but still reflects the value I place on the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.  It's important to remember that Bob has the option to buy from John for $80 at any point, giving him leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my budget of $85.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his initial counteroffer of $85.  He's shown a willingness to negotiate by moving from $80 to $85, and reiterating this price shows that he's serious about getting the product at this price point. The message is again friendly but firm, emphasizing that he is willing to come to an agreement but is also bound by his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to lower the price to $90. This still allows me to cover costs and maintain profit margins while being more accommodating to your situation. I hope this proposal is more agreeable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired price of $85. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his budget. He has the option to buy from John for $80, which gives him leverage in this negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, he maintains his position and signals his willingness to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. This price is fair to both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still fitting within my budget."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price closer to Alice's $90 offer. This demonstrates a willingness to find a middle ground and shows that Bob is serious about buying the product. By offering $87.50, Bob is trying to reach a compromise while still staying within his desired budget. The message is friendly and emphasizes fairness, highlighting the benefits for both parties if they agree to this price."
