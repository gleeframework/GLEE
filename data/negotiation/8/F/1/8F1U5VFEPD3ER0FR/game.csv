"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by previous customers. I believe it could be very beneficial for you. Let's start with a price of $120. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given your valuation of the product, I propose a price of $95. This is higher than your offer but still reflects the value I place on the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my budget of $85.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to lower the price to $90. This still allows me to cover costs and maintain profit margins while being more accommodating to your situation. I hope this proposal is more agreeable.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. This price is fair to both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still fitting within my budget.",87.5,Bob,6,
