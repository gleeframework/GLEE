"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price given its value to both of us. I know this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product at the maximum you're willing to pay and at her own valuation.  There's no room for negotiation in her offer. By rejecting, you might incentivize her to propose a lower price to avoid losing the sale.  Worst case, you can buy from John at the same price."
