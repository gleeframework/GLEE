"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $9,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $11,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm not ready to meet you at that price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $10,500? I think it's a fair price that balances our interests.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to find a solution. I'm willing to go up to $10,250. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,250. I'll make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11,000? I think it's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,7,
