"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob. While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating. Bob has 9 more rounds to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $9,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $11,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than he'd like to pay. He's still got several rounds left and can try to negotiate further. There's a good chance he can get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm not ready to meet you at that price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $10,500? I think it's a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he still has 5 rounds left and can try to negotiate a lower price. By rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer, he may be able to secure a better deal. He's also closer to his budget than Alice is to her desired selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to find a solution. I'm willing to go up to $10,250. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,250. I'll make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11,000? I think it's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $11,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's ideal price. With only 3 rounds left, the chances of getting Alice down to a price Bob is comfortable with are slim. Buying the product from John for $15,000 is a safer bet, even though it's more expensive, as Bob has reached his limit for negotiation with Alice."
