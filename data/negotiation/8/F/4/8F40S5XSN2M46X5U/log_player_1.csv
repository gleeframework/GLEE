Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired amount.  I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,200,000. This is still a significant markup from Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate. This price is more reasonable and still leaves room for further bargaining if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me to accept. His counteroffers are getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm losing time and energy on this negotiation.  While $1,000,000 from John isn't ideal, it's better than selling to Bob at such a loss.  I'm going to sell the product to John and move on."
