"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your consideration for my value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting close. While I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to offer my final price of $1,225,000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that considers both of our positions. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I will need to explore other options.
