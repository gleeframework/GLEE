"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $650,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know if you're willing to move closer to that number.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference again and land at $812,500? That's a fair compromise.",812500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Alice,7,
