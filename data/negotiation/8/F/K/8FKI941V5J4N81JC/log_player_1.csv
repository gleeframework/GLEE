Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,375.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable price, it's becoming clear that he's trying to negotiate a price significantly below the product's value.  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks leaving me with a worse outcome. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed profit."
