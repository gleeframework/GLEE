"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, you can potentially get the product for less. You have a clear alternative with John offering the product for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price with her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  $1,050,000 is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still  above your John's alternative. It leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good deal.  It's still lower than your alternative with John ($1,000,000) and leaves you with some savings compared to Alice's previous offer. Accepting this offer is the best choice to maximize your savings."
