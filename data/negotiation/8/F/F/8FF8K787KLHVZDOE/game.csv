,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $175. Would you be willing to consider that price?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
