"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting allows me to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
