"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I agree it has value, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
