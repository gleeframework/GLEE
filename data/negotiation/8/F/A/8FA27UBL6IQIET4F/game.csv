,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in buying, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to offer $11,000, as I'm truly interested in acquiring this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway again. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
