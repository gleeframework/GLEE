{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  He'll have to consider it seriously.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You still have room to negotiate if necessary.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  This makes you seem reasonable. 

I'll keep an eye on the negotiation and adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum, and I'm not ready to give up that much profit. 

I will counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,800 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,150?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11150}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility.  This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, and leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  It's time to move on to John, who is offering a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
