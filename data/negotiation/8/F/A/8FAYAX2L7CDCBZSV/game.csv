"Bob, I believe this product holds immense value for you, as it's worth $1,500,000.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This represents a significant discount, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for me, while acknowledging your value assessment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's settle this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
