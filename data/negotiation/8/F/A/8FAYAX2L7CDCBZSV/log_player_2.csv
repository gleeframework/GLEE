"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds immense value for you, as it's worth $1,500,000.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This represents a significant discount, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for me, while acknowledging your value assessment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's settle this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down to her value for the product.  There is no guarantee you can negotiate further down, and continuing the negotiation risks her backing out or you running out of rounds. Accepting at $1,000,000 is a good deal."
