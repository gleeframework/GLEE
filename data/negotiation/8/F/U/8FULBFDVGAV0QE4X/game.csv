"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  Would you be interested in $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",8250.0,Alice,5,
