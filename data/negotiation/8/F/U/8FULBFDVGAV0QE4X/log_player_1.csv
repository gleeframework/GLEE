{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500** is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to engage. 
* By offering a price closer to my minimum, I maximize the chance of a successful sale while still potentially gaining a higher price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer and potentially adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. 
* Remember, I have the option to sell to John at any point if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  It's also quite low compared to my initial offer of $9,500. 
* **Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.** 
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.**  This keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob first.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  Would you be interested in $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **I've adjusted my offer to $8,500.**  This is still above Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **The message remains friendly and emphasizes a fair deal for both of us.**  This helps keep the negotiation open and avoids a tense atmosphere. 
* **My goal is to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us.**  By offering a price closer to Bob's but still above my minimum, I'm showing flexibility while maintaining my financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.** While it's closer to my previous counteroffer of $8,500, it's still not high enough for me to accept.
* **I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.** There's potential for him to increase his offer, and I want to see if we can find a compromise.
* **While selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob.**  I'll use this opportunity to counteroffer again, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I've raised my counteroffer to $8,250.** This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum price. 
* **The message emphasizes fairness and a desire to find a middle ground.** This keeps the negotiation friendly and avoids a stalemate.
* **My goal is to meet Bob halfway and finalize a deal.** If he accepts, I'll have achieved a good price. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John, as further negotiations may not be fruitful."
