"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially allows Bob to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget. This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness in securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  If he can get a price closer to $1,300,000, it's worth the risk of continuing the negotiation rather than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise. This counteroffer is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This could potentially lead to a deal being reached in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,370,000 is only $70,000 more than Bob's maximum budget.  Considering that this is the fifth round of negotiation, it is likely that Alice is unlikely to budge further.  There's a good chance that Alice may even increase her offer in the next round.  It's better for Bob to secure this deal now and save the risk of further negotiation."
