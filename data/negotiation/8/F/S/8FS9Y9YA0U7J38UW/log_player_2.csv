"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $12000 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You can potentially save even more money by making a counteroffer.  You're not under pressure to buy immediately, as John is a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  I'm serious about buying it if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see that you're a serious buyer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I think that's a fair price for this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,000, showing she's willing to negotiate. You're still saving $4,000 compared to John's price, and it's likely you won't get a significantly better offer from Alice.  It's time to close the deal."
