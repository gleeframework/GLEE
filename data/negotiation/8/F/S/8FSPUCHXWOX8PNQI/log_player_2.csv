"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and my budget constraints. Let me know if you're willing to consider this figure."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,150,000 is already a very competitive price.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,100,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is within my budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's a good compromise, and there's a good chance I won't be able to negotiate further down."
