"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a solution that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin negotiations with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price makes it clear that you're willing to negotiate, fostering a sense of collaboration. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind your fallback option with John, who's ready to pay your desired price. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,200,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches his perceived value, which is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 falls significantly short of the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to find a compromise. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  By coming down $200,000, you're demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, you're still keeping the price well above both Bob's offer and your absolute minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob of the potential benefits, justifying the higher price.
* **Time Constraint:**  As the negotiation progresses, you might consider gradually decreasing your counteroffers while remaining aware of the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant amount above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's a risk that Bob could walk away. Accepting now guarantees a substantial profit."
