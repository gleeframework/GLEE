"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $12,800. It's a fair price that still reflects its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $12,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price difference is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $12,000. This is a fair offer considering the market value, and I'm serious about buying at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
