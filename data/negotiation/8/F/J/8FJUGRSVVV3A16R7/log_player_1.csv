{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to $10,000 through negotiations, but I'm also prepared to walk away if I don't feel the price is right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9,000 for it. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get closer to $9,500 with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,250 for the product.  It's truly a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer and am willing to go up to $9,100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $100 less than my last counteroffer.  While I'd like to push for more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal, and I'm running the risk of losing the sale altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a profit of $1,100, which is a good outcome."
