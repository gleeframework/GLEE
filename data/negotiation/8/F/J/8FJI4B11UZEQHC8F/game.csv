"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product holds value for me, but not at that price. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $800,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  To be frank, I'm working with a budget closer to $1,000,000 for this purchase.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the $900,000 offer is still significantly below what I can accept.  This product has incredible potential and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment.  Let's settle this now - how about $1,100,000?  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
