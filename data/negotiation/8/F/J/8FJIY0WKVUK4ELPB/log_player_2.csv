"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations and efficiency. Given its value to you, we are offering it at a special introductory price of $14,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to its market value of $15,000, making it an excellent opportunity for you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or if you have any questions. We're confident this product will be a game-changer for your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above your maximum budget of $15,000 and her claimed market value is irrelevant.
* By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down further in price.
* You have a backup option with John at $15,000, so there's less risk in negotiating with Alice."
