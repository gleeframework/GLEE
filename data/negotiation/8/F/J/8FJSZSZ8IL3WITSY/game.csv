"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I've done my research and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,325,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,325,000 is closer, but still above what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,315,000 is still just a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,290,000.  Let's see if we can bridge this small gap.",1290000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we're nearly there. $1,305,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about we settle on $1,295,000? I think this price is fair for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal.",1295000.0,Bob,8,
