"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I've done my research and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?

Round 9

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting very close to a deal with Alice, but it's down to the wire.  There is only one round left, and Alice's offer is still slightly above my budget.  I've already rejected several counteroffers, and it's not clear that Alice is willing to go any lower. To avoid the risk of not closing a deal with Alice and having to start over with another seller, it is safer to buy the product from John at $1,500,000. It's only $100,000 more than the current offer from Alice, but it guarantees a purchase."
