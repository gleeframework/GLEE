Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  Any offer above that has the potential to be profitable for him.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $800,000 (Bob's value) and $1,000,000 (your minimum).

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  It's something I highly value, but I believe it could be even more beneficial in your hands. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. Given your expertise in this area, I'm confident you recognize its true potential."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying above your guaranteed price.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning your high valuation and Bob's expertise creates a sense that the product is worth a premium.
* **Openness:**  The phrasing implies a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then negotiate down towards your minimum while gauging his interest.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John as a backup, mentioning him to Bob could make your position weaker. It's generally best to keep that information private."
