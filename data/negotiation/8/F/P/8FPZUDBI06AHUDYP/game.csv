"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
