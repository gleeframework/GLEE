"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,050,000 is tempting, it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, meeting you halfway. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While $1,075,000 is closer to my desired price point, I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to lower my price further to $1,050,000. This would be a win-win scenario for both of us. Let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
