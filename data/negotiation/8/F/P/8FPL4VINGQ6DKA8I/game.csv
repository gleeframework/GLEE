"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair price that considers both our positions.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is getting closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good balance between our interests. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
