"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the product's actual value, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Bob is offering a lower price than Alice's initial offer, showing he's serious about getting a better deal.  
* **Justification:** He's providing a reason for his lower offer (his budget), making it less likely for Alice to simply reject without a counter-offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $9,000 leaves some wiggle room for Alice to counter-offer while still potentially being profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can realistically afford right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This approach shows that Bob is willing to compromise and aims for a middle ground.
* **Positive phrasing:** ""I'm sure we can find a solution"" keeps the tone friendly and collaborative.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The offer is still below Alice's current offer, leaving room for her to counter-offer if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and $10,000 is still too high for him. He's already negotiated down from $12,000, so there's likely still room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit too high at $10,000.  I'm ready to close the deal right now for $9,500.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  Bob is making a final offer, showing his seriousness. 
* **Focus on closing:**  ""Let's make this happen"" conveys a sense of urgency, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Small but significant:** The offer is still lower than Alice's last offer, but it's a relatively small difference. This might make Alice more likely to accept, as she's already negotiated down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. I'm willing to come down to $9,800. This is a fair compromise and a great deal for you. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer of $9,800 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $8,000.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only three rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying more than $9,800 in the end.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Bob has already invested significant time in negotiation. Buying from John now would be a quick and certain way to get the product, but it would cost Bob more.

By accepting, Bob secures a good deal, gets the product, and avoids potential risks of further negotiation."
