"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:** 
I'm aiming for a quick deal but also keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I can use the threat of selling to John as leverage if Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount yet. I'll try to push for a better price in the next round. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial $12,000 offer. If Bob continues to be stubborn, I might consider selling to John, especially as I've already lost one round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $12,000 to $10,500. This shows flexibility, but it's still a price that's closer to my desired outcome than Bob's offer.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value he'll get at this price. This keeps the negotiation friendly and focuses on a potential win-win.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping to find a price point that's acceptable to both of us.  If Bob continues to be resistant, I'll need to weigh my options and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can realistically afford right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's $9,750, but still lower than my previous $10,500. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal within the remaining rounds. However, I'm mindful of the time constraint and will consider selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my offer to $10,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,750.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and reminding Bob of the value he'll gain from the product. I'm also expressing confidence in reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this compromise will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware of the time constraint. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit too high at $10,000.  I'm ready to close the deal right now for $9,500.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price for this product. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price that's higher than Bob's $9,500 but still lower than my previous $10,000. I need to find a middle ground quickly. If Bob continues to be resistant, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round. Time is running out."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. I'm willing to come down to $9,800. This is a fair compromise and a great deal for you. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 9800} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've lowered my price to $9,800. This is a small compromise from my previous offer of $10,000, but it's still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and the importance of closing the deal. I'm using persuasive language to try and convince Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

Time is running out, so I'm making a final push to try and get Bob to accept. If he rejects this offer, I will very likely sell to John in the next round to secure a better price."
