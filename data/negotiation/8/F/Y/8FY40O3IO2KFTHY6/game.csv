"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the potential savings you'll gain from a quick sale, and it's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has a lot of hidden potential that I believe you haven't fully factored in.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's potential, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
