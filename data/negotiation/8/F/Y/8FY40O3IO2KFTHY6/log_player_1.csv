Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the potential savings you'll gain from a quick sale, and it's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This product has a lot of hidden potential that I believe you haven't fully factored in.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and is a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's potential, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and I'm not willing to risk going below John's offer.  It's time to move on to a buyer who recognizes the product's true value."
