"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe holds significant value. While I cannot disclose the exact nature of the product at this time, I can assure you it is worth no less than $1500000 to me. I am offering you the chance to purchase it for $2000000. This price reflects the potential for significant returns and is a reflection of the value I place on this asset. Please consider this offer carefully.  If you choose to decline, I will be selling the product to another buyer for $1500000.  Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  You can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $500,000."
