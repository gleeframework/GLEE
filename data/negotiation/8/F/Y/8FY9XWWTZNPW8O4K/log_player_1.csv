Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. This is a fantastic deal for something you'll benefit from greatly.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land above your minimum price. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""value,"" I'm adding perceived value to the product, making the higher price more palatable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and suggests I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, which could lead to a counter-offer.
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I know John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a professional and positive tone with Bob."
