"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what you can get it for from John.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can do $125, which is still a great discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above both your budget and what John offers. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my firm limit."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  This counter-offer makes it clear that $100 is your top price. This avoids unnecessary back-and-forth.
* **Matches Your Alternative:** By offering $100, you're signaling that you're willing to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't accept.
* **Potentially Acceptable:** While Alice values the product at $120, there's a chance she might accept $100 to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $100. I can do $110, which is still a great compromise, but it's the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $110.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, which meets your budget."
