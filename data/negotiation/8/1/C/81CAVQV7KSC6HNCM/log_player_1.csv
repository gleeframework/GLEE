Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This represents a significant discount compared to the value it could bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who offers the highest potential profit, while still having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
