"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This represents a significant discount compared to the value it could bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale.
* **Get closer to a fair price:** Even if you end up buying from John, rejecting this offer puts you in a stronger negotiating position in future interactions."
