"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at the maximum price to allow for some wiggle room during the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Continues:** While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, it's still above my minimum.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **More Room for Profit:**  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $14,000 price by counter-offering. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John at $10,000 would be my last resort, as I'm still confident I can secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This gives you a great price and me a fair return.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, framing the offer as a win-win scenario.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm still seeking a price closer to my desired $14,000 but acknowledging Bob's limitations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still above my floor of $10,000. There's still room for improvement.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, as Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  I have the advantage of knowing John is willing to pay $10,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by making another concession, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Finality:** I'm using language like ""significant price reduction"" and ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like this is a good final offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm reiterating the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and this is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer and continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, or I might not be able to secure a better price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit of $1,000, which is a good outcome considering the potential risks.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that I might need to sell to John at a lower price if I don't accept this offer."
