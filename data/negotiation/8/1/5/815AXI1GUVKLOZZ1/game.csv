"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm confident it will be a highly profitable investment for you. I propose a starting price of $2,250,000.  What do you think?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my maximum investment limit of $1,500,000, I'd like to propose a price of $1,500,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a quick sale.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction and a testament to my willingness to make this deal work.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued negotiation. I'm still eager to acquire this product, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,750,000. This reflects a serious commitment to this deal and is within my financial constraints. Let's make this happen.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be mindful of the product's value. I can go down to $1,900,000, which is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,800,000.  This would allow us to reach an agreement and avoid the need to involve other sellers. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,6,
