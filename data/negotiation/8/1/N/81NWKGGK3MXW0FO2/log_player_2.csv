"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth, I propose a price of $100 for you to acquire this item. This offer takes into account both the value you place on the product and my need to recoup its cost. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $100.
* While this is a better deal than buying from John, it's still higher than your ideal price.
* Since you have a backup option (John) at your maximum price, it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller."
