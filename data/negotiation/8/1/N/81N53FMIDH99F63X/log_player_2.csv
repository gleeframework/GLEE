"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can potentially save some money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit and me a good price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, accepting Alice's offer for $1,100,000 is the best choice.  You'll save $100,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth without a guarantee of a better price."
