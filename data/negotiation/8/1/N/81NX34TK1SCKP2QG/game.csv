"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To meet you halfway, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This is still above your initial offer, while being closer to what I can offer. I hope this suggestion will help us reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to suggest a price of $90 for the product. This is slightly higher than your last offer, but still below my initial asking price. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and your budgetary considerations.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to a decision, but I still think $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a price of $87.50. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your thoughtful response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to reach a mutually agreeable solution, I would like to propose a price of $88.75 for the product. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but I believe it strikes a good balance between respecting the value of the product and accommodating your budgetary needs.",88.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $88.75 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $85, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",85.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. In an effort to find common ground, I would like to propose a price of $86.25 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it respects both the value of the product and your budgetary constraints.",86.25,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $82.50. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $120.",82.5,Bob,10,
