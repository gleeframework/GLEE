"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. This gives you a great deal while still reflecting the asset's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a significant discount for you, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and desire for a good deal. However, my initial offer already factored in significant value for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value of this product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  He's still aiming for a price closer to $950,000 and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  There's still room to find a price that works for both of them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value this product, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price is a good compromise, allowing for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
