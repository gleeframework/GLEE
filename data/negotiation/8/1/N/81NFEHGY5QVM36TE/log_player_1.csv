{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $80.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm also trying to build a little rapport by mentioning how much I think he'll like the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $90?  That's still a fair price for this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to stick to my original request at $80 if possible. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my minimum price, and Bob is firm on $80.  Since John is also willing to pay $80, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll sell to John and save myself the hassle."
