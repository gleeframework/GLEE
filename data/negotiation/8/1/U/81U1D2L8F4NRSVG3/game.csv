"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still just a little off the mark for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
