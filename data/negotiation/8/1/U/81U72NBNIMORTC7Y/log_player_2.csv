"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $150 from John. Since Alice values the product at $100, you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really looking for a good deal, and $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $115 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price of $150 and still allows you to save $10 compared to your initial counteroffer."
