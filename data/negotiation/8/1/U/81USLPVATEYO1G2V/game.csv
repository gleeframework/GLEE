"Alice, your product looks great, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate your offer while still reflecting the true value of our product, I am proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This price still allows us to cover our costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin, while also being more accessible to you. Please let me know if this revised price works for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $850,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $825,000. This price is fair, considering my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your continued interest in our product. To further explore the possibility of reaching an agreement, I propose a counteroffer of $840,000.
