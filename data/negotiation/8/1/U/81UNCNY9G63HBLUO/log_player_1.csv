Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know Bob values the product at $120, so this price leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can come down a bit, but I won't go below my minimum of $150.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a potential buyer, which gives me leverage in case negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, I can still do better. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $150, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident that $160 is a fair price, given that Bob is willing to pay $140.  If he rejects, I'll reconsider my options, but I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $150 and a decent profit.  I'm also considering the risk of continuing negotiations.  Bob might not be willing to go any higher, and I risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me $150, but I'd rather get the extra $5 from Bob if possible."
