"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Building Rapport:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Strategic Buffer:**  Offering $1,000,000 allows for potential counteroffers and still gives me a significant profit margin.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum. I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Strategic Patience:** I'm not desperate to sell quickly. By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him I'm firm on my valuation and encourage further negotiation. 
* **Exploring Potential:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can gauge his true willingness to pay and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price recognizes the value you'll gain from the product, and it gives me a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will receive from the product to justify the price. 
* **Creating Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's see if we can find common ground"" subtly emphasizes the possibility of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is now within a closer range of my desired price, but $920,000 is still below my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price, potentially reaching a compromise closer to $950,000.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  If I can't secure a better price from Bob, I still have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher profit.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, considering the value this product offers, I believe a price of $940,000 is fair. This is a compromise that reflects both our interests.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, signaling my willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Creating Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's finalize this deal and make it happen"" suggests a sense of finality and encourages Bob to accept. 

By offering $940,000, I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We're at a point where Bob's counteroffers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is decreasing.
* **Securing a Higher Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures a significantly higher profit than accepting Bob's offer. 

Given the current situation, it's in my best interest to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
