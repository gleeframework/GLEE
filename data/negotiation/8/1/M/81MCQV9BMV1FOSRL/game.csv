"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your needs and the value of the product to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,4,
