Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to spend. I could consider a price closer to $500,000.  What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a respectable amount, his latest message suggests he's getting impatient and may not be willing to go much higher. At this stage, the difference between his potential offer and John's guaranteed $1,000,000 isn't worth the risk of continued negotiation. Accepting John's offer provides a guaranteed, substantial profit without the uncertainty of further haggling."
