"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm aiming for.  Would you consider $11,500? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm really keen on this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
