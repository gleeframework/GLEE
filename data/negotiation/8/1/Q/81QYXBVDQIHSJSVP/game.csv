"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you and allows me to secure a very good price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me and allows you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? That gives you a good price and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this number.",925000.0,Alice,3,
