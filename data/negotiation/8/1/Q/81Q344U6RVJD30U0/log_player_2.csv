Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think the product is valuable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000, but I need to be clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is holding firm at $900,000, and has stated this is her final offer.  Even though we have rounds left, it's unlikely she'll budge significantly. To avoid the risk of the price not coming down further and potentially wasting more rounds, it's time to cut our losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $800,000."
