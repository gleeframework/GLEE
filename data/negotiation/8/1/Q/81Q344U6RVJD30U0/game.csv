"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the product is valuable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000, but I need to be clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
