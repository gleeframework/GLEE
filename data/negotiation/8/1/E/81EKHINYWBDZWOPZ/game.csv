"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,
