"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product."", 
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a significantly lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Aiming for a Deal:** While $8,000 is my walk-away point, I'm aiming to get the product for a significantly lower price if possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** My counteroffer leaves a lot of room for Alice to counter, keeping the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** $9,000 is closer to my limit, but it's still above the $8,000 I can get it for from John.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving down $2,000 from her initial offer. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Leveraging John:** I'll use the option of buying from John as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $6,500, but to be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8,000.  If you can get closer to that price, I'd much prefer to buy from you."", 
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $6,500, showing Alice that I'm willing to move but also anchoring the negotiation below her $9,000. 
* **Introducing Competition:**  By mentioning the other offer at $8,000, I'm creating a sense of urgency and a reason for Alice to lower her price further. This leverages the John option without completely revealing my walk-away price.
* **Expressing Preference:** I'm emphasizing that I'd rather buy from Alice, which could encourage her to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Difference:** Alice is now only $200 above my walk-away price. It's worth seeing if I can close that gap.
* **Final Push:**  I'll make one last counteroffer close to my limit, making it clear this is my final offer. 
* **John as Backup:** If Alice doesn't budge, I'm content with buying from John at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close. I can offer you $7,900 for the product. I'm stretching my budget here, so that's really the best I can do. If you're willing to work with me on this, I'm ready to close the deal."", 
""product_price"": 7900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is designed to be my final offer. It's just below my $8,000 walk-away price, leaving very little room for further negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating it's my best offer and expressing readiness to close the deal, I'm creating a sense of urgency for Alice to make a decision. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** I'm maintaining a respectful tone while clearly stating my limits, hoping to encourage Alice to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,900. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to my Limit:**  Alice is unwilling to come down to my final offer of $7,900. Her latest offer of $8,500 is above my walk-away price.
* **Time to Move On:**  I've negotiated in good faith and made it clear what I'm willing to pay. It's unlikely Alice will budge further. 
* **John's Guarantee:**  I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. It's time to take that option and avoid potentially wasting more time in a negotiation that might not go anywhere."
