"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll be very satisfied with it."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. How about we meet at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, accepting $110 is a reasonable gain over my minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
