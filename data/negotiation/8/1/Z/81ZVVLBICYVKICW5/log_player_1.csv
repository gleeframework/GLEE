{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $127.5 is significantly better than selling to John for $100. It's a good compromise and a decent profit for me."
