"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  While I'm confident it's worth more than $800,000 to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential value to you.  How about $1,000,000?  This price allows for a significant return on investment for you, while still ensuring I get a fair price for my asset.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than your fallback option of buying from John for $1,200,000. By rejecting her offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price or proceed with your backup plan, saving you a considerable amount of money."
