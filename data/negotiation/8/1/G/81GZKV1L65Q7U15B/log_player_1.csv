We're still significantly above John's offer. While coming down in larger increments might seem risky, Bob's consistent counter-offers show he's still interested and willing to negotiate.  We need to signal we are also willing to negotiate but are firm on a good price."

Bob is clearly very interested but also firm on not meeting the higher price points. Taking $1,380,000 is a good deal, especially considering the time investment and uncertainty of continuing the negotiation."
