"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,125,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $900,000?  I think that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
