"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value and would benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $120.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John, as you'll save $1."
