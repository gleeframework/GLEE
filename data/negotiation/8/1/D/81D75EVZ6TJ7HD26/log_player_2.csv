Alice's offer:

This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,475,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. To make this work for me, I'd need to settle for a price of $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,550,000, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $1,500,000.  Save the $50,000 and buy from John."
