"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price within his budget. $8,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer and close to Bob's maximum, showing a strong desire to negotiate. This counteroffer will likely prompt Alice to reconsider her position and possibly counter with a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He has already shown a strong desire to negotiate and hasn't shown a willingness to accept prices above his target range. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a slight concession, but still staying within his budget.  Offering $9,000 shows willingness to compromise while also leaving room for potential further negotiation.  This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between Bob's initial offer and Alice's current offer, potentially leading to a deal in the next round."
