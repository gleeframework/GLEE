"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth more than $80 to Alice, so she'll likely be willing to negotiate.  Rejecting her first offer is the best way to start the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down slightly, but $95 is still a bit high. I'm going to try to get her down closer to my target price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? That's a good compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 90}
