"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get at least my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? That's a good compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Although I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's a decent profit and avoids the risk of having to counteroffer again, which might lead to a further reduction in price. It also avoids the need to sell to John for $100."
