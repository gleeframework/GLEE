"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. If you're serious about finding a compromise, I could go up to $950,000.  Beyond that, I'd have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but we're still quite a ways off. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
