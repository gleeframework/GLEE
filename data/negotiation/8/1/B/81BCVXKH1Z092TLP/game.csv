"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $1,075,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000, just like my previous offer. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to John.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and my previous offer of $975,000. My next counteroffer is $1,012,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1012500.0,Bob,8,
