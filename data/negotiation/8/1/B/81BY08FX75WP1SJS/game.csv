"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $130 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair compromise that still gets you a great deal, and I'm willing to make it work.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $120.  Would you be willing to do $115?",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. How about we do $118? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it work.",118.0,Alice,5,
