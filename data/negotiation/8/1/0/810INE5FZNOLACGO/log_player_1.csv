"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit lower than the product's value to Bob, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I believe there's still room for a better deal considering Bob's initial valuation of the product. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still allows me to make a good profit while being fair to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $11,250 is a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while also ensuring I close the deal.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
