"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below my desired value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product to you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
