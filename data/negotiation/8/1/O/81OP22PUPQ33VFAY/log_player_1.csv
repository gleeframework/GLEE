{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's above your minimum:** This ensures you get a profit.
* **It's a strong starting position:**  It demonstrates you're serious about selling to Bob, but you also value the product.

Keep in mind that this is just the first offer. You'll need to be flexible and adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is lower than your initial offer, but still above your minimum threshold of $10,000. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, especially considering he's already expressed interest.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting his offer shows you're not desperate to sell at a lower price and positions you for a stronger counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $14,000.  Consider offering a price between $13,000 and $13,500 to maintain a balanced negotiating position."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original offer. I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). 
* **Maintaining Value:** The price is still above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you're getting a decent profit. 
* **Showcasing Flexibility:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of your own value judgment.

**Strategy:** 

By offering a slightly lower price, you're showing flexibility without completely giving in. This creates a more balanced negotiating position and increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum of $10,000, it's getting closer to your minimum, and you still have room to negotiate a slightly higher price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** You believe you can still get a price closer to $12,500, which would be more profitable. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting the offer again demonstrates you're not desperate to sell and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This could potentially push Bob to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob. Consider offering a price between $12,250 and $12,500 to maintain a balanced negotiating position."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($12,000) and your previous offer ($13,250). 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While it's less than your ideal price, it still offers a decent profit while acknowledging Bob's financial limitations. 
* **Final Stand:** This offer signals a potential final stand. If Bob rejects this, you'll likely accept his offer or sell to John.

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer aims to secure a mutually acceptable price while leaving room for a final negotiation point. It balances your desire for a higher price with the need to close the deal and avoid selling to John for a lower price."
