"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for this product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we've both discussed. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
