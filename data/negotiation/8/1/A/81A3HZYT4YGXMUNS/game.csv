"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't afford $9,500 for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it since it's worth that much to me. Could we meet somewhere in between?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is simply too low. How about $8,800? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",8800.0,Alice,3,
