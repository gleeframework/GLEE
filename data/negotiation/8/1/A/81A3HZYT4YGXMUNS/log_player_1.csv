Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't afford $9,500 for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it since it's worth that much to me. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to get at least $8,000, I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is simply too low. How about $8,800? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I believe $8,600 would be a fair price. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting $8,600 guarantees a sale and is a decent profit. I don't want to risk losing Bob and ending up with John's offer of $8,000."
