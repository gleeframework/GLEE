"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the value it holds for me while still allowing you a healthy profit margin. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still gives you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,065,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",1065000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too much.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is my final offer, and it's very close to my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
