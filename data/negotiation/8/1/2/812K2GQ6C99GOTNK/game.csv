"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin, considering your own valuation of the product.  Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $1,050,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, to show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll be moving on to other opportunities.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,080,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,080,000, which would be $1,065,000. This is my final offer as well.",1065000.0,Bob,6,
