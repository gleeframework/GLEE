{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still above your minimum of $1,500,000, leaving you with some profit margin.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price point allows for both parties to potentially come to an agreement without having to drastically shift their positions.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum valuation of $1,500,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher, and I don't want to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the true value of the product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this deal work.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $1,050,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to try one more counteroffer.  If Bob isn't willing to go higher, I'll go with John's offer."
