"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This would be a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and it's a price I can comfortably afford. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,,
