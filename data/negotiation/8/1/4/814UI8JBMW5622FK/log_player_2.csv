You should reject Alice's offer. You're aiming for a price below $80, and $120 is too high.  It's time to counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $100?  That would still give me a little room to make this worthwhile, and hopefully it's a price you're happy with.

While $100 is closer to your target, it's still above your preferred price point. Reject the offer and counteroffer again."
