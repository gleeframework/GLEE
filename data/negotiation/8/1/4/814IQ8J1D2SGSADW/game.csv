"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly outside my budget. Given my research, I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident it's worth considerably more.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm confident that $1,000,000 is a fair and reasonable price.  Let's find a middle ground here. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price. It shows you're serious. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a bit below what I can accept. However, I'm very motivated to close a deal with you today. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.  Let's close this deal today!",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit, and I can't let this go for less than $1,450,000.  This is my final offer - how about we seal the deal right now?",1450000.0,Alice,7,
