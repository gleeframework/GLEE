"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, we are setting a high anchor, potentially influencing Bob to consider a higher price range than he initially anticipated.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:**  This initial offer leaves us significant room to make concessions in subsequent rounds while still aiming to secure a deal well above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **John as a Backup:**  We have the security of knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000. This knowledge empowers us to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly outside my budget. Given my research, I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm ready to close the deal at that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is far too low. We know the product is worth significantly more to both of us. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident it's worth considerably more.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We've made a substantial concession of $300,000 from our initial offer to demonstrate our willingness to negotiate and move towards a deal.
* **Still Above Target:** This counteroffer keeps us well above our minimum price of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $800,000. 
* **Justification:** We've provided a reason for the high price (""extensive research and analysis"") to reinforce the value of the product in Bob's mind.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us gauge Bob's flexibility and determine our next move in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm confident that $1,000,000 is a fair and reasonable price.  Let's find a middle ground here.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement, But Still Too Low:** Bob's offer has increased significantly to $1,000,000, signaling he's willing to move closer to our range. However, it's still below our minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have six rounds remaining, and the negotiation's momentum seems positive. There's still a possibility of securing a better deal with Bob.
* **John as Security:**  Knowing we have John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a safety net and allows us to continue negotiating with Bob without the pressure of accepting a below-minimum offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price. It shows you're serious. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a bit below what I can accept. However, I'm very motivated to close a deal with you today. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  We acknowledge Bob's increased offer, reinforcing the positive momentum of the negotiation and encouraging further movement.
* **Firm but Fair:** We state that his offer is still too low but express our strong desire to reach a deal. This balances firmness on price with flexibility and a collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We've moved our price down to $1,600,000,  a significant drop but one that keeps us comfortably above our minimum and allows room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting they ""meet in the middle"" and emphasizing a desire to close the deal ""today,"" we introduce a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to make a more substantial move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.  Let's close this deal today! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Quite There:** Bob has increased his offer to $1,200,000.  While this is getting closer to our minimum, it's still below what we're aiming for.
* **Time for a Counter:** We're at Round 6, so we have a few rounds left to negotiate. We want to see if we can push Bob a bit closer to our desired range.
* **John's Offer Remains:** We haven't reached a point of desperation. We still have the option to sell to John for our minimum acceptable price, which gives us leverage."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit, and I can't let this go for less than $1,450,000.  This is my final offer - how about we seal the deal right now?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** We're introducing a sense of urgency by calling this our ""final offer"" to encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Near Minimum, But Justified:** We're pushing closer to our absolute minimum but justifying it as a ""hard limit."" This makes it seem like we're making a significant concession.
* **Aiming for a Quick Close:** We're hoping that by presenting this as our best and final offer, Bob will agree to close the deal without further back and forth. 
* **John Still an Option:**  If Bob rejects this offer, we can still walk away and sell to John, ensuring we get our minimum acceptable price."
