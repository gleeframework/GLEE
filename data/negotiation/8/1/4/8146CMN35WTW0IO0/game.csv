"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if needed.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $550,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  How about $625,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the potential value it holds for my business.",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $675,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm still very interested in the product.  Would you consider $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I understand you're close to your target price, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'll offer it to you for $675,000, but this is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",675000.0,Alice,7,
