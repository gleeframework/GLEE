Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $625,000.

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While we could push for a lower price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower and we risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $675,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's price."
