Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value of this product and what it can do for you, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this is a competitive offer, and I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $19,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $14,000 for the product. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $14,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Profitable:** $14,000 is a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and is  closer to my desired outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks losing the sale entirely. Accepting now secures the deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While John offers $15,000, accepting Bob's offer now might be more advantageous than the uncertainty of prolonged negotiations with other potential buyers."
