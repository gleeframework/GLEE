"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the product's value to me.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is below the product's true value and my initial investment. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for $1,500,000? This price acknowledges its worth while still offering you significant value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's true value to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his price, but we still have room to negotiate. Accepting his offer now would mean leaving money on the table.  We'll make another counteroffer, inching closer to his price while still aiming for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, and I'm motivated to close this deal.  Let's make this work. How about we agree on $1,350,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which shows my commitment to closing this deal. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has finally moved from his initial offer, and while it's not the $1,350,000 we aimed for, $1,250,000 is a reasonable profit. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or us running out of rounds and getting stuck with John's offer."
