"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the product's value to me.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is below the product's true value and my initial investment. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for $1,500,000? This price acknowledges its worth while still offering you significant value.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's true value to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
