"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find this a valuable purchase.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. I'll offer you the product for $9,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,5,
