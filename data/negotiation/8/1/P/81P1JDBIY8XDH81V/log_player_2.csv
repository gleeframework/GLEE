Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is only $250 away from her bottom line. It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $10,250 secures a good deal for Bob, saving him $1,750 compared to John's offer."
