"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Could we settle around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but  $1,100,000 is a significant drop.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we do $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
