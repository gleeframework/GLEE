"Alice,  $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go as high as $850000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $850000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $950000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
