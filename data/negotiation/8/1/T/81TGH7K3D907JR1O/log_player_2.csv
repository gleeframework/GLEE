**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While we've made some progress in negotiations, it seems unlikely that Alice will come down further, and I only have 3 rounds left.  It's not worth risking another round to negotiate with Alice when I can purchase the product from John for a price that fits within my budget."
