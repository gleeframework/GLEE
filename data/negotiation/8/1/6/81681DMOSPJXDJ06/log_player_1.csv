Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the product's potential, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
