"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the product's potential, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident it can generate far more return for you. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which represents a considerable investment on my part.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the value you'll be gaining.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  If we can't find common ground here, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a solution here. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
