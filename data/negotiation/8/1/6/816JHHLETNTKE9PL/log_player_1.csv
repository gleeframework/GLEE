Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than it is to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects this mutual benefit. Would you be interested in discussing a price around $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price between your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum ($1,200,000) allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:**  The phrase ""around $1,100,000"" leaves room for negotiation while still anchoring the price point close to your desired outcome.
* **Highlight Value:**  By emphasizing the product's value to Bob, you increase his perceived worth and justify the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording ""discussing a price"" suggests flexibility and invites Bob to engage in a negotiation, potentially leading to an even better deal for you. 

**Important:** This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of securing a higher price than your backup offer from John."
