Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a fair price that is lower than Bob's valuation but higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is a decent price, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 128}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $128. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $127 is close enough to my target price that I'm willing to accept it. It's more than what John would pay, and the negotiations have gone on long enough."
