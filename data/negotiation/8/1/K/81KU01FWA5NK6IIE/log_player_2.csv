"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but we're starting the negotiation at $95. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We know she values the product at $80, and we're willing to pay up to $120. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to see how much negotiating room we have. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  Offering $70 leaves space to potentially meet in the middle if Alice counters.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a lower number first, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $85. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $85 is still above her value of $80. We're also not even close to our maximum budget of $120. Let's see if we can nudge her a bit lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving up slightly from our previous offer of $70 to show Alice we're willing to compromise.
* **Staying Below Our Limit:**  $75 keeps us well below our $120 maximum and a good margin below Alice's current offer. 
* **Creating Urgency (Subtle):** By suggesting this is a ""fair deal for both of us,"" we're subtly implying that we might consider other options if we can't agree soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $80. This allows us to reach an agreement while also ensuring I receive a fair return for my product. I hope this proposal suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her value for the product ($80). It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Accepting this offer gets us a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
