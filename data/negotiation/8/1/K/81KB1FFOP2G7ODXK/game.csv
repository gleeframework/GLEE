"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  How about $10,500?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I think $10,500 is still a bit high. How about $10,000? That's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
