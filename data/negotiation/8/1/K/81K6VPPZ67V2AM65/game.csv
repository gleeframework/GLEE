"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $600,000, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,000,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm open to negotiating. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $900,000. This offer still allows you to benefit greatly from the product's potential.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me, though. I'm prepared to offer $750,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
