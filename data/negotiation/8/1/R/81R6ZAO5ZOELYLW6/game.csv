"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. However, $14,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
