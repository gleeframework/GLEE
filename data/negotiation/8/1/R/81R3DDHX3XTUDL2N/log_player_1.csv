"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm taking a chance.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any point if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $17,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still value the product highly.  We'll see if he's willing to budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  He's come up to $16,000, which is a good price considering my minimum is $12,000.  I'm happy with this profit, and it's better than risking a further negotiation that might not be successful."
