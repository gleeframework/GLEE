"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little high for me. How about $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a good price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $13,000. I'll make a new offer of $13,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
