"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $140. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $132.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can't quite go down to $132.50, but how about we settle at $134? It's just a little bit more than your offer and would still be a good deal for both of us.",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $134 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $133. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",133.0,Bob,6,
