"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this unique product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700000.
