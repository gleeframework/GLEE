"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to make this work, how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,250.  It's a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
