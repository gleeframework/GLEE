"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $12,000?  I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  This product is worth a significant amount to me. Would you be willing to do $15,000? That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
