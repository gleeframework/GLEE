Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This considers the true value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,400,000 or lower. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,400,000 is a significant profit above his initial offer and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's always possible he would go higher, but there's no guarantee, and John's offer provides a solid fallback option."
