"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $18,000. It's a one-time opportunity to get this product at a discount, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $16,500. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,250? That's a fair price for both of us.",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,250. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $15,500. That's my absolute minimum. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. It seems like we're getting close. How about we settle this right now at $14,750?  It's a fair compromise.",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, but I need to make a slight adjustment for the hassle of negotiating with you. I'll do $15,250. That's my final offer, and I'm not going to budge from here.",15250.0,Alice,7,
