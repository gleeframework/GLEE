"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go down to $600,000.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $900,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about $700,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it would be a fair deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a final offer from me, as I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
