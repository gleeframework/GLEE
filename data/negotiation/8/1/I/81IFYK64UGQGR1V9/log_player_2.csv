"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $900,000. This is a significant price point for you, but it also ensures a healthy profit for me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have John as a backup option at $1,000,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price from Alice if you reject her initial offer."
