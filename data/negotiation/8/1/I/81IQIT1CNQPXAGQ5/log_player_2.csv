# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is starting at her maximum price. Since you know John will sell the product for $8,000, there's no need to negotiate with Alice.  You'll save the most money by going directly to John."
