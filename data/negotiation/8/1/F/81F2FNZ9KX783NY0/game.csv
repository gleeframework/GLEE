"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,3,
