Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **My Value:** My minimum acceptable price is $800,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $800,000.

By offering $1,000,000, I am:

* **Maximizing my potential profit:** I get $200,000 more than John's offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob has a potential $200,000 saving by accepting this offer.

This offer is high enough to be attractive to Bob, but also low enough to leave room for negotiation if he's unwilling to pay the full $1,000,000."
