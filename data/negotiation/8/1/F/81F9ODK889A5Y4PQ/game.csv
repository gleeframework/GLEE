"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle around $750,000. Would you be open to that?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. It seems we're close. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
