"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $9,000 for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $9,250 for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  Bob should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering $9,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected this offer once. While it's tempting to ""meet in the middle"", Bob has made it clear he's willing to pay a maximum of $8,750. There's still a chance Alice might come down to that price, so it's worth rejecting this offer and trying for another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're still a bit above your minimum.  However, I'm really pushing my budget here.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800.  This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $9,100, which is a bit above my initial offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum price, but Alice is still too high. While it's tempting to accept this offer,  Bob should try one more counteroffer.  He's already stated that he's willing to go up to $8,800, so his next counteroffer should be at that price.  If Alice rejects it, then Bob can consider buying from John, as his budget is almost exhausted."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I've really stretched my budget here.  $8,800 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you've reached your budget limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm counteroffering $9,200, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his budget limit and has already stated his maximum price multiple times.  Alice has made it clear that she's willing to go no lower than $9,200. This is still too high for Bob.  It's better to cut his losses and buy from John for $12,000. He has one round left, and the chances of Alice coming down to his price are extremely low."
