"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me to consider. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it can make a big difference for you. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
