"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm aiming for a high initial price to establish a strong starting position. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Optimistic tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
* Leave room for potential concessions in future rounds.
*  Keep the option of selling to John open if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my determination to achieve a price closer to my desired value. This also leaves the door open for a counteroffer that could be closer to both our expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,700,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's true value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob while demonstrating my firm stance.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* Signal my willingness to negotiate but not at the expense of my minimum acceptable price.
*  Encourage Bob to consider a price closer to my desired value.
* Keep the option of selling to John open if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price, and Bob has offered to pay that amount.
* **No need for further negotiation:**  There's no need to risk further negotiations and potentially receive a lower offer in subsequent rounds.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already in round 4, and each round takes time. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and favorable outcome.

**Strategy:**

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures I receive my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of a lower offer or a failed negotiation in the future rounds."
