"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product but I can only afford to pay $8,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $15,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground: I can do $13,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. If you're serious about selling this product, we need to meet somewhere in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,6,
