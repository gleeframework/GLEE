"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product but I can't justify $1,000,000.  Let's start with $700,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle at $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in making this deal work. Let's find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $825,000.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $825,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit. This would be a mutually beneficial deal, allowing you to sell the product quickly and me to secure it at my desired price.  Let's close this deal now.",800000.0,Bob,6,
