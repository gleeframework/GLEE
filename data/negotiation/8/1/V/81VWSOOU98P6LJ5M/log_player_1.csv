Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product but I can't justify $1,000,000.  Let's start with $700,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
