"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. Let's settle this right now. How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $1,287,500? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1287500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  Let's be completely transparent.  I have another buyer interested at a lower price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to close this deal. My final offer is $1,260,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  Take it or leave it.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
