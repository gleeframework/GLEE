{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  You want to see if you can get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price allows for room to negotiate.  A $5,000 drop is a significant reduction, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but also sets a clear lower bound for your acceptance range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
