Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $900,000 is still higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, giving him some room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's below my minimum value:** This offer gives me room to lower the price if necessary without dropping below my $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **It sets a clear expectation:**  It shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product and willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  $875,000 is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach a deal while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Maintaining my minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm prepared to lower the price slightly, but not drastically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet your price of $875,000. I would like to propose $860,000 for the product. I hope this is a price that you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. Further negotiation might be possible, but at this point, the time and effort required to potentially gain another $40,000 isn't worth the risk. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, which is a much more reliable outcome."
