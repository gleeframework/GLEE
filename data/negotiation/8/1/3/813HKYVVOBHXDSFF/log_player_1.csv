"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $11,000?

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $11,000 is still too low for me, as I value the product at $10,000 minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my target price."

While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at a point where I feel comfortable selling. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
