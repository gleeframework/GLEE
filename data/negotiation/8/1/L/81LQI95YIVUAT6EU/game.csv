"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9250?  This still gives you a great deal, and gets us closer to a deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",9000.0,Bob,4,
