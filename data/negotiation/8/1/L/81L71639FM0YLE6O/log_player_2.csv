"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the $12,000 I'm willing to pay, so it's worth exploring if I can get an even better price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $8000 is a good one, but I'm still looking to get a bit more value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still above my target price of $8,000. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $9,000 is still a bit higher than where I want to be. I'm happy to meet you at $8500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $8500 is a good one, but I'm still not willing to give up too much value on the product. I'm willing to meet you at $8700, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $8,700 is a good deal for me. It's still within my budget, and it's close enough to my target price that further negotiation might not be worth the effort.  I'd rather secure the product at this price than risk going back and forth and possibly ending up paying John $12,000."
