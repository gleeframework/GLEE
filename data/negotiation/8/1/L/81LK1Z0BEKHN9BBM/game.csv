"Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $825,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a beneficial deal on your end.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from that number. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still too low for me to consider. My final offer is $800,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the value you'll gain from it.",800000.0,Alice,5,
