Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $825,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a beneficial deal on your end.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still too low for me to consider. My final offer is $800,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the value you'll gain from it.

Alice has come down to her value for the product. There's no guarantee of getting a better price by continuing the negotiation, and it risks having to buy from John at the higher price."
