"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm definitely open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
