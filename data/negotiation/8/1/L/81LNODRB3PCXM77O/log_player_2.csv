"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob has room to negotiate a lower price, as Alice is willing to discuss. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** If the negotiation fails, Bob can still buy the product from John.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range considering Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Demonstrates willingness to negotiate:**  The message shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better deal. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  Bob's counteroffer provides space for both parties to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm definitely open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise achieved:** Alice's offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between their previous offers. 
* **Close to Bob's target:**  $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price of $1,050,000 than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a lower price.  Alice might be firm on this offer.

Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that is a good deal, given the alternative of buying from John."
