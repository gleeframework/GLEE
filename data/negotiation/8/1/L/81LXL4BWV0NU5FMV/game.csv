"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1100000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with $1075000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
