Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $120, so $140 is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and for you to compromise. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** You clearly state the price and invite Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't exceed $120 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price. While you'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer ensures you don't lose money and avoids further negotiation.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the next round, and selling to John will also yield the same amount."
