,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product is high-quality and offers a lot of value. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we settle at $100? That's a significant price drop on my end.",100.0,Alice,5,
