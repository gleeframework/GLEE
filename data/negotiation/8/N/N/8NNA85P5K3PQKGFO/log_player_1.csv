Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation.

**Why a Deal is Unlikely**

You cannot offer a price below $1,500,000 without losing money. Bob is not willing to pay more than $1,200,000. This makes a deal impossible under the current circumstances.

**The Offer (Knowing a Deal is Unlikely)**

While you know a deal is improbable, you can still make an offer to maintain a relationship with Bob or for potential future opportunities. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]  at a premium price of $1,700,000. I believe this product has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I'm prioritizing you for this offer. Please take some time to consider its value to your specific needs. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1700000 
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Price:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, making it clear this is a premium offer.
* **Justification:** You're emphasizing the product's potential value and the fact that you're prioritizing Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message encourages Bob to respond, even if it's to negotiate or explain why the price isn't feasible.

**Important Notes:**

* **Don't Lowball:** Offering a price close to John's offer ($1,500,000) is unlikely to work and might offend Bob.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  You have a guaranteed buyer, so don't feel pressured to accept a deal below your minimum.

This situation highlights the importance of understanding both your own position and the other party's valuation before entering a negotiation."
