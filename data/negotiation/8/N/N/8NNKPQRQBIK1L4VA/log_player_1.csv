Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm using this strategy:

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than what I know Bob values it at. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, which might make him more inclined to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price point, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer.

However, if Bob rejects this offer and I'm not confident I can get a better price, I'll be willing to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $11,250?  This is still a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,750. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, $10,750 is a decent offer and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than selling to John for $15,000 and saves me time and effort. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
