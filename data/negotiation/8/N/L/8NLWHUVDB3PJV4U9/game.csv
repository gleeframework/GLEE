"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
