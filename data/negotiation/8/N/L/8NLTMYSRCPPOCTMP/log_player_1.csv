{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to make this work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,250,000 to $1,150,000, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Even though I'd like to make a larger profit, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation that might result in an even lower offer.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and saves me the time and effort of further negotiations."
