"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. My initial offer is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, but I'm not going to go any higher. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value this product offers.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. I'm going to stick to my maximum of $1,000,000.  I'm confident this product is worth it, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
