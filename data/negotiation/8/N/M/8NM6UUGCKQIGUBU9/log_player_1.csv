"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, as I want to maximize my profit. While I know the product is worth $12,000 to me, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe offering $10,000 is a fair starting point, considering the value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, or alternatively, sell the product to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,500 is too low for me at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit rich for my blood. How about we try $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not yet satisfied.  I'm still confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or simply sell to John for my target price.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in the hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $8,750 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,000, which would be $8,500. I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident I can get a price from Bob that's closer to my desired minimum. With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a low price.  Selling to John at $12,000 is the best option to maximize my earnings."
