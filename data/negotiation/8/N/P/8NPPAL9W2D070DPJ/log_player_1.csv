Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This reflects its unique qualities and potential for your business.  Let's chat and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product would be valuable, but $900,000 is a significant investment. How about we bring the price down to $700,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to him, and also below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for a loss.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price acknowledges the product's worth to you while still allowing me to achieve my target. Let's keep talking and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and so am I.  $850,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $750,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than the product's value to me.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $750,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $825,000.
