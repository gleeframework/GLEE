"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This reflects its unique qualities and potential for your business.  Let's chat and see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product would be valuable, but $900,000 is a significant investment. How about we bring the price down to $700,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting its worth to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price acknowledges the product's worth to you while still allowing me to achieve my target. Let's keep talking and find a solution that works for both of us.

""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and so am I.  $850,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $750,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise to me."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but $750,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $825,000.  This price reflects the value of this product for your business while acknowledging your budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal in the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal. I understand we're nearing a compromise. How about we meet at $790,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to reach my minimum price and securing this valuable product for your business.  Let's finalize this deal in the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below her offer of $790,000.  At this point, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000. You'll save yourself further negotiation and potentially get a slightly better deal."
