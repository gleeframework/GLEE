"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 undervalues the uniqueness and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $1,650,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
