Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives us room to negotiate.  I'm also factoring in that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point, especially since I have John as a backup option.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely we won't get any closer. It's also a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for $10,000."
