"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm sure you'll agree it's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is high. While you would still profit by buying at $900,000, you can potentially get a better deal from John, who's your backup option at $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation."
