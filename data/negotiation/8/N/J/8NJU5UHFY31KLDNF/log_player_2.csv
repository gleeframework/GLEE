"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within Bob's budget of $15,000.
*  This is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.
*  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject and he'd be forced to buy from John. 
* Accepting the offer at $13,500 is the most financially sound decision at this point."
