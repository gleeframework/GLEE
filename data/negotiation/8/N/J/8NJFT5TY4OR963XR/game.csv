"Thank you for considering my previous offers and coming down to $1,300,000. I'm still not convinced that the price is right, but I'm willing to make one more move. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, but I need you to throw in some additional value to make it worth it. Can you throw in some extra support or services to sweeten the deal?",1250000.0,Bob,6,

Can you consider adding some additional features or services to sweeten the deal?",1225000.0,Bob,8,
