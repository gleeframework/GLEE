Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's valuation) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed price).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but there are a couple of approaches:

1. **High Anchor:** Start with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation to try and anchor the negotiation in your favor. This might involve some back-and-forth.

2. **""Take it or Leave it"" within the ZOPA:**  Offer a price that's favorable to you but still potentially acceptable to Bob, with the understanding that you have another buyer.

**The Offer (Example using the ""High Anchor"" approach)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **High Anchor:** The $1,450,000 price is well above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer (Subtle Pressure):**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, a more aggressive approach within the ZOPA might be suitable.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive opening might be preferable.
