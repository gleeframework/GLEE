"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  $110 is still above Bob's maximum value of $120.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **John is a backup option.**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $120 gives Bob leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a reasonable counteroffer:** Offering $105 is a significant step down from Alice's $110, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $105 is still within Bob's budget, allowing for potential concessions if needed.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  Knowing John's price, Bob can be more assertive in getting closer to Alice's value of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is not getting closer to Bob's value.**  $115 is still too high for Bob.
* **Time is on Bob's side.**  With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time for Alice to come down in price. 
* **John remains a viable alternative.**  While Bob prefers to save more, John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This offer moves closer to Alice's last offer of $115, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Still within Bob's budget:** $108 is still below Bob's maximum value of $120.
* **Pressuring Alice:** With each round, Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price, potentially prompting Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is not getting closer to Bob's value.**  $118 is still too high for Bob.
* **Time is running out, but there's still room for negotiation.**  With 5 rounds left, Bob can try to push for a lower price, but he needs to act decisively.
* **John's offer is becoming more attractive.**  If Bob can't secure a better price with Alice, John's $120 offer is looking increasingly viable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last chance for a significant concession:** This offer is a substantial step up from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.
* **Pressure on Alice:** With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob is running out of time to secure a better price. This offer puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Assessing the risk:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will need to seriously consider purchasing from John, as the remaining rounds may not provide enough time to negotiate a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only three rounds left, Bob is at a crucial point in the negotiation. 
* **Alice's offer is not significantly better:**  $119 is still close to Bob's maximum value of $120.
* **John's offer is now more attractive:**  With only three rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate a better price with Alice.  John's $120 offer provides a guaranteed purchase within Bob's budget.

**At this point, Bob has to weigh the risk of not securing the product vs. potentially getting a slightly better price with Alice.  The safer option is to buy from John.**"
