Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. This offer ensures she gets a significantly better price if Bob accepts."
