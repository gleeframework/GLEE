"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1150000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1200000, so I'll offer $1175000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
