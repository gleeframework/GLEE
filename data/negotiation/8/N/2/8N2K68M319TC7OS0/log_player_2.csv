You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
