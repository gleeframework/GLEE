"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable asset at a special introductory price of $950,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents an exceptional value considering the product's worth to you is estimated at $1,000,000. I look forward to discussing the details further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for that price, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your product is of interest, I'm currently working with a budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that figure?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
