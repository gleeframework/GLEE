"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very fair price. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($100 < $120).**  This means you're getting a good deal compared to buying from John.
* **You save $20 compared to buying from John.**  This is a significant saving for you.

Even though you believe the product is worth $120 to you, it's still a good deal to buy it for $100. You're getting the product for less than your maximum value, and you're saving money."
