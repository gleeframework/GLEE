Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're ensuring you make a profit of at least $150,000. 
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's being ripped off. 
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** You can still increase the price if Bob makes a counteroffer that's too low.

By starting with a high offer and leaving space for negotiation, you increase your chances of getting closer to Bob's perceived value while still ensuring a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $850000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is still a decent profit, it's closer to your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open.  You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer and hopefully find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing you're willing to negotiate while still securing a substantial profit.
* **Fairness:** You're highlighting the value to both parties, positioning the offer as fair and reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While it's closer to Bob's offer, it still leaves room for him to counter if he wants to continue negotiating. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and keeps you in a strong position to close a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's meet in the middle at $875000. I think this represents a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $875,000 is still a significant profit for you, exceeding your minimum acceptable price by $75,000.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  Further negotiation might lead to a prolonged back-and-forth without guaranteeing a better deal. 
* **Risk of John:**  If you continue to reject offers and ultimately decide to sell to John, you'll earn less than you can with Bob.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good deal with a reasonable profit and avoid potential risks of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
