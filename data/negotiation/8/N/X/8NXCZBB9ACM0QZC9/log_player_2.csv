"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price. It's a risk, but the potential savings are worth exploring."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but there's still potential for a better deal.  Rejecting her offer again allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price, as he is still above Alice's minimum."
