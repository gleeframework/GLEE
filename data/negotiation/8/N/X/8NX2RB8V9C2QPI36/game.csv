"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to receive for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1600000?  This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1550000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
