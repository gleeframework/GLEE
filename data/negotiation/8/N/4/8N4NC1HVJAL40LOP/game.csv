"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's my final offer. I think we're getting close, and I'd like to make a deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
