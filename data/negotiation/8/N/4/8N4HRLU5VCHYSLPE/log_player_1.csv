Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not ready to meet you at $95 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.
