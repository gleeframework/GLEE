Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,500 is still higher than your minimum of $10,000, giving you some flexibility.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  The offer is not outrageous, making it more likely that Bob will engage in negotiations rather than immediately rejecting it. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still potentially making a sale. This offer balances those objectives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob. There's a chance you can get closer to your desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to your minimum while still being appealing enough for Bob to consider.  A counteroffer of $9,000 might be a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting your interests. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  Highlighting the value of the product at $9,000 can make Bob more inclined to accept. 
* **Remaining Flexible:** Leaving room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While you could try to counteroffer again, the risk is that Bob will keep lowering the price, and you might end up settling for something you're not happy with. 

John is willing to pay your minimum price, and there's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a better offer from Bob. It's better to secure the sale with John and avoid further negotiation."
