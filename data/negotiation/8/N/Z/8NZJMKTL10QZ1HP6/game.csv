"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go much higher than that.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $137.50 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $142.50. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",142.5,Alice,5,
