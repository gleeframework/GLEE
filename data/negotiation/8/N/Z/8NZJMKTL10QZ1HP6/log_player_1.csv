``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($150), leaving room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. It also uses positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 
While Bob's offer is above his estimated value of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go much higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  I'm confident that I can get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
