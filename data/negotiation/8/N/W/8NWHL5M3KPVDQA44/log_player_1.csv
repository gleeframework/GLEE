"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation ($800,000) is helpful, I want to anchor the negotiation closer to my own valuation ($1,200,000).  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price without explicitly revealing why it's so valuable to me. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point for discussions"" signals my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum ($1,200,000) and even below his own perceived value ($800,000). This suggests room for negotiation. I'm willing to engage further to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is considerably below the product's true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from this unique product."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's ""true value and potential,"" aiming to shift Bob's focus away from his initial lowball offer.
* **Significant Concession (but not too much):**  Dropping $50,000 shows flexibility but keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and his estimated value. 
* **Justification:** I'm directly linking the price to the ""significant benefits"" Bob will receive, reinforcing the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $975,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is moving closer to my range, his increments are small, and we're still significantly apart. 
* **Time Consideration:** With six rounds remaining, I have some time to negotiate, but I need to see more substantial movement from Bob to justify continuing with him over John's guaranteed offer.
* **Maintain Value Perception:** Accepting $975,000 at this stage might signal that I'm willing to go even lower, which could hurt me in further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite a ways apart. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to make one more move to $1,000,000, but this is my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end and acknowledges your interest in the product."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning ""another buyer at a higher price point"" adds a sense of urgency and value without revealing John's specific offer.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  Presenting this as my ""final offer"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to be more decisive.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""significant compromise"" emphasizes my movement and makes the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Slight Concession:**  Moving slightly to $1,000,000 shows some flexibility while still aiming for a strong position if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more move, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffers are consistently small, and he's unwilling to meet me near my desired price. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. The potential gain from Bob is now outweighed by the certainty of John's offer.
* **Limited Time:**  With only four rounds left, the time pressure is increasing. It's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John now."
