Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit, but leaves room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This keeps the negotiation focused and efficient."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** I am not willing to sell the product for $8,000 as it's below my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Although Bob's offer is low, it's still an indication that he's interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to counter-offer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a backup option:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, I know that selling to John guarantees a higher profit and is a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my minimum profit margin.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth and encouraging him to see the offer as a good deal.
* **Keep Open Communication:**  My message is friendly and invites Bob to continue the conversation, keeping the negotiation going."
