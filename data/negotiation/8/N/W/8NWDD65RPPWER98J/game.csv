"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $12,500. This is my best compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'll counter with $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,5,
