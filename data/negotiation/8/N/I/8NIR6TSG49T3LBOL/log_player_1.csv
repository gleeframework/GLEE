"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $7,500 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about $9,000?  It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4

While $8,200 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not completely satisfied. I'll try to push for a little more in the next round, as I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $8,600.  This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8600}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob, we're running out of time. I don't want to risk getting a lower offer than John's in the remaining rounds."
