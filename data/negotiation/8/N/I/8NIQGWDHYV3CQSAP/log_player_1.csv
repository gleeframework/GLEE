Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in.  I'm willing to let it go for $130.  Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **The message** is friendly and encouraging, making Bob feel like I'm willing to work with him.

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** While $130 is less than my minimum, it's better than selling to John for $150.
* **Starts the negotiation:** This encourages Bob to engage in a discussion and potentially increase his offer.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** I can still adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a great price for a product that is worth a lot more.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$115** is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than his initial offer.  It shows I'm flexible but not desperate.
* **The message** is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. I'm also using a question to encourage Bob to respond. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Improves chances of closing the deal:**  A counteroffer keeps the negotiation going.
* **Maintains a higher price:** $115 is still more than what Bob initially offered. 
* **Shows flexibility:** I'm willing to adjust my price, but not at a huge loss to myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $105 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, it's becoming clear that Bob's maximum price is lower than my minimum.  Rather than continuing a potentially long and fruitless negotiation, it's more efficient to sell to John for $150 and ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."
