{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $8,500. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250? I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8500. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob has shown a willingness to pay close to my minimum.  If I reject his offer and counteroffer, he may walk away and I'd only be left with John's offer of $8,000. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a price that is only slightly less than my desired minimum."
