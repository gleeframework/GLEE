"Alice, $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $8500. How about we split the difference and meet at $9250? I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",9250.0,Alice,3,
