Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's a fair price for both of us. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is still a good outcome.  It's higher than my minimum acceptable price, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a sale to John at $80."
