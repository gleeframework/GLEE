"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting significantly above both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) provides room for negotiation and signals the product's worth.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This high initial offer allows you to assess how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His reaction will give you valuable information for future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000. This knowledge empowers you to be firm in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Explore Higher Prices:** You can gauge if Bob is willing to go higher. There's a chance he anchored his offer low, expecting a counteroffer.
* **Maintain Negotiating Position:** Accepting immediately might signal desperation and limit your ability to secure a better deal.

You'll need to carefully consider your counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're showing flexibility by decreasing your price, but not drastically. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming high. 
* **Justification:** Re-emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially nudge Bob closer to your target.
* **Time Consideration:** You have seven rounds remaining, giving you space to make calculated moves before potentially accepting Bob's offer or going with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Potential Upside:**  While $1,250,000 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to $1,300,000.
* **John as Leverage:**  Remember, John's offer provides a safety net. You don't need to rush to accept an offer below your desired outcome. 

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, consider countering with a price around $1,325,000 - $1,350,000. This shows continued flexibility while aiming for a strong final agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,325,000? This reflects a fair deal considering the product's quality and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Midpoint:** $1,325,000 represents a near-perfect midpoint between your last offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,250,000). This shows you're actively seeking compromise.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:** Emphasize that this price is fair for both parties. Highlighting the product's value reinforces why this is a reasonable request.
* **Time Factor:**  You're now halfway through the rounds.  This offer applies a bit more pressure to reach a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has returned to his initial offer of $1,200,000, indicating he might not be willing to go any higher.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks leaving money on the table. You've spent several rounds without significant progress.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John provides a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the deal with John."
