"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
