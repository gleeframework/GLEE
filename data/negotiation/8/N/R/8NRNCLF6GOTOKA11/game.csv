"Thank you for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1600000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1700000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay within my target. I'm counteroffering at $1680000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1620000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1620000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! However, $1620000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay within my target. I'm counteroffering at $1660000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. What do you think?",1660000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go below $1660000, Bob. I'm feeling a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle yet. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to stay firm on my price.
