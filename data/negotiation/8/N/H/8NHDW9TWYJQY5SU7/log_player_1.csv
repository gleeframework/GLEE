"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,500. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be interested, as the product is worth $12,000 to him, and this is still a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for further negotiation. I believe this is a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to move higher with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
```

I'm going to make one last counteroffer at $12,800. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer and is getting closer to my desired price. It's a good compromise that shows my willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,200 is only slightly below my minimum value of $12,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome, and there's a risk that we could reach an impasse.  I'm going to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
