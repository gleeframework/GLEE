{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for $12,000 from John.
* Alice's offer is $10,000, which is still above your target of $12,000. 
* It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to get the product for under $12,000. 
* This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, significantly lower than Alice's offer but still potentially profitable for her. 
* It gives Alice room to negotiate while still saving you money compared to John's offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is within your budget of $12,000.
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer again, potentially driving the price up.
* It's more prudent to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still beneficial to you."
