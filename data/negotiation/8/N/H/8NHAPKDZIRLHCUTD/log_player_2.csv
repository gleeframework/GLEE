"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to her initial offer. While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of further rounds and potential delays, especially considering the 10-round limit.  It also brings the price closer to John's offer, making it a more attractive deal."
