"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is simply too high for me. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation.  I understand your initial offer, but I believe it significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I'm confident this price reflects the immense value it holds.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but the gap is still too wide for me.  To be clear, I think this product has value, but  $1,200,000 is not feasible. I could go as high as $750,000, but that's my limit.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here, and I respect your position.  Let's bridge this gap. How about we settle at $1,000,000?  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to go for a product of this caliber.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
