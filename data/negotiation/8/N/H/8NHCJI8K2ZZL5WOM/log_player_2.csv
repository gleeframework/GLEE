Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation.  I understand your initial offer, but I believe it significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here, and I respect your position.  Let's bridge this gap. How about we settle at $1,000,000?  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to go for a product of this caliber.
