"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique opportunity this product presents.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to come down in price, but not as drastically as I'd initially hoped.  At $825,000, I'm still saving $175,000 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely I'll get Alice much lower, and further negotiation risks her pulling back. This feels like a reasonable compromise."
