"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for room to negotiate down if needed. It's important to remember that I want to maximize my profit, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, so I have a clear lower limit.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not going to sell for a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping that this is a more reasonable compromise that will lead to a deal.  I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. If I can't reach a deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $16,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible.  However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price, and $16,000 is still above the price I'd accept from John. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm only two rounds away from being able to sell to John for $15,000, which is a better deal for me.  I'll try to push for a higher price with Bob in the next round, but if that fails, I'll be ready to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $14,500. This is just a little higher than Bob's offer, but it's still a decent compromise.  I'm hoping this small increase will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as I'm now only one round away from selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is it. Bob is not willing to go any higher, and I'm only one round away from being able to sell to John for $15,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed profit."
