"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be open to a price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
