Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
