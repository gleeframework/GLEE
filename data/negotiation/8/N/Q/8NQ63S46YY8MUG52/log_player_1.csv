"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to Bob and I can get at least $10,000 from John. I'm not willing to settle for $11,500, so I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,500? This price still leaves room for you to make a profit and is fair considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get more for the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be able to cover my costs.  Let's split the difference again. How about $11,750? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price of $10,000, but it's still too low for me. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob. With only a few rounds left, it's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk ending up with nothing."
