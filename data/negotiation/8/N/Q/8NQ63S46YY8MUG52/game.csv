,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,500? This price still leaves room for you to make a profit and is fair considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be able to cover my costs.  Let's split the difference again. How about $11,750? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
