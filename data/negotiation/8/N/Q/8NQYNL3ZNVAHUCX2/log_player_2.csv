"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and you'll be getting it for a lower price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to you, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for $1,000,000, saving you $150,000."
