Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of such high value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($800,000) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your desired profit. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:**  You have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000) if Bob rejects. This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your potential profit."
