Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but I'm hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to my ideal selling price.  

I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he seems interested but balks at the price, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower offer, but I won't drop below my minimum value. I also have the option of accepting a lower counteroffer if it's close to what I'm willing to accept, or walking away and selling to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer.  I'm hoping that by showing I'm willing to negotiate, he might be willing to increase his offer a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial goal, but I'm prepared to be flexible depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price. While $1,650,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, it's a good deal that's well above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product. I've secured a price that's good for me while also avoiding further negotiation that might risk a breakdown."
