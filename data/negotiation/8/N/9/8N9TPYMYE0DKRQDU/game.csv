"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value is higher.  Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product's value is higher, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,275,000, which would be $1,237,500. Is that something we can work with?",1237500.0,Bob,4,
