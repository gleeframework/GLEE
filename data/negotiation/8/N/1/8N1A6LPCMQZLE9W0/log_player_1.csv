"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm not just stating a price, but hinting at the product's value to Bob. This might make him more inclined to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to get the best possible price from Bob while leaving room for concessions if necessary. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails, providing me with a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $110 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** It's too early to accept such a low offer. I need to keep negotiating to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  While $150 from John is tempting, I'm not desperate yet. I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate this product. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $160, which is still above my minimum but a significant step down from my initial offer. 
* **Rationale:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Negotiation Mindset:** I'm trying to find a middle ground by being willing to compromise, while still maintaining a price that's closer to my goal. 

**Strategy:** I'm trying to show flexibility without giving away too much.  I'm hoping to keep the negotiations going and secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm hoping we can find a number that works for both of us. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  While I'm aware that time is running out, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Option to Sell to John:** I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better price from Bob, but I'm also considering John's offer as a backup plan.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap between our desired prices. However, if Bob continues to offer prices that are too low, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $125 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident you won't regret this purchase."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $140, a further concession but still above my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Rationale:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and demonstrating flexibility while still remaining firm on my price point.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a price that's too low.

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round.  I'm reaching a point where time is becoming a factor, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Time Factor:** We are approaching the middle of our 10 rounds, and further negotiation with Bob might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Decision:** With John's offer of $150 available, it makes more sense to accept his offer and secure a guaranteed profit.  While I'd like to get a better price from Bob, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gains."
