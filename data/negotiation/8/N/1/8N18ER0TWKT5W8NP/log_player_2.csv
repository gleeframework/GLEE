"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's a good idea to start by rejecting the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product though.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price, aiming to create a more balanced starting point for negotiation. This initial counteroffer shows Bob's serious interest while also emphasizing his budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, $10000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $17500. This reflects the value and quality of the product.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, even though it's a reduction from her initial offer. There's still room for negotiation, and it's a good idea to continue trying to get the price closer to his preferred range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $17,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, so I hope we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Reaching the limit:** Bob is now offering his maximum price, making it clear this is his final offer.
* **Directness:**  The message clearly states his absolute limit, putting pressure on Alice to consider his offer.
* **Hopeful tone:**  The message ends on a positive note, hoping for a solution. This keeps the negotiation open while still showing Bob's firm position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $15000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:**  Alice's offer of $15,000 is still outside of Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Negotiation room:** Even though Alice has reduced her price, there's still room for further negotiation, especially since Bob has already stated his absolute maximum. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob still has several rounds left and can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or choose to buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down further.  While $15,000 is closer, I'm still at my limit of $12,000.  This is the best I can do, and I truly believe this product is worth it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiteration of Maximum:** Bob is again clearly stating his absolute maximum price, leaving no room for further increases from his end.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  He's highlighting that he believes the product is valuable, justifying his willingness to pay his top price.
* **Open to Compromise:**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can make this work"" keeps the negotiation open while emphasizing his firm position."
