"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a bit too far below my starting point. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant offer considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's fair. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,325,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
