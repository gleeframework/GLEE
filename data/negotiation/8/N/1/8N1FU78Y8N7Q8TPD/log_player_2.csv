Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value this product holds for you, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than this. It's better to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid the risk of Alice increasing her price in later rounds."
