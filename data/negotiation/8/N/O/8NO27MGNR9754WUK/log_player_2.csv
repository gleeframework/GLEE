"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and he has room to negotiate. He can try to get a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's still better off trying to get a better deal from Alice than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your revised offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $835,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's very close to his target price of $800,000, and there's still room for Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. Let's aim for a final agreement. I'm willing to pay $810,000 for the product. This is very close to my limit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 810000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $810,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $820,000 is still too high.  Since Bob has a guaranteed way to get the product for $800,000, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice.  There's a risk that Alice will counter with a price that is higher than $800,000, making John the better option."
