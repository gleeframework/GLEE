"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He wants to save as much money as possible and $12,500 is more than his $12,000 limit. He should see if he can get a better deal with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $11,500 for this product. If you're willing to come down a bit, I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting for your money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's at his maximum price point of $12,000, and it's better than buying from John at the same price. It's a win-win situation for Bob since he gets the product at his price limit and Alice gets the sale."
