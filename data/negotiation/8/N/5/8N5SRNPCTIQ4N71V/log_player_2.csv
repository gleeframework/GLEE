"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $9,000
* **John's Offer:** $10,000
* **Your Maximum:** $10,000

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know John will sell it for $10,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or stick with John if necessary."
