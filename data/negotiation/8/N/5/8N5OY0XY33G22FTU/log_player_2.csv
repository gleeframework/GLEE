"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high for your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John for $80 as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a strong opening move, signaling my willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear boundary.  It's likely Alice will counter, but I'm hoping to get the price closer to my target before I have to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my preferred price. I'm not willing to pay $90, especially with John's offer of $80 still available. I'll continue to negotiate and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer was closer, but I'm still aiming to save as much as possible. I'm offering $85, which is a good compromise. It's higher than my preferred price but still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and accept, but if not, I'm still ready to move closer to John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $87 is getting very close to my maximum budget of $80.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's likely that further negotiation won't get me much lower. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product, as I only have 5 rounds left.  Going to John would save me $7, but I could miss out on this product completely if Alice gets another offer."
