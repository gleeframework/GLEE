"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we compromise at $9,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,900. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",8800.0,Bob,6,
