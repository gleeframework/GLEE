Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price:** This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **It shows confidence in the value of the product:** A high initial offer can make Bob feel like the product is in high demand and encourage him to take the deal. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and try to gauge his interest.  I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower than $20,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000 as a counteroffer.  This is a significant reduction from my original offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. However, it's still above Bob's offer of $15,000, demonstrating that I still believe the product is worth more.  This allows for further negotiation while still getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is significantly closer to my desired price than his previous offer and is within a range I'm willing to accept.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high.  Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer."
