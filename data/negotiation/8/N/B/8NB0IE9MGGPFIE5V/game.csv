"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my initial offer. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, but I'm still hoping to get it for $800000. Let's see if we can bridge that small gap.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you, Bob. However, I'm still hesitant to go below $850000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $825000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,
