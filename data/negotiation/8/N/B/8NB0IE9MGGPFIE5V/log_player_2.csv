# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my initial offer. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

While $850,000 is a good price, there's still some wiggle room.  Bob should try to negotiate a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $750,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you, Bob. However, I'm still hesitant to go below $850000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $825000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Bob has already successfully negotiated the price down from $900,000 to $825,000. While he could try for a lower price, accepting this offer saves him time and the potential for a stalemate in negotiations. It also ensures he gets the product at a good price without having to resort to buying from John at a much higher price."
