"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, knowing Alice's minimum is $10,000. A counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate.  This leaves some room for Alice to counter while still being a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and closer to her initial price. While this is a good price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He's not desperate and has the option of buying from John, so he's in a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's moved up from his previous offer but is still below Alice's current offer. This shows that he's serious about getting a deal, but also that he's not willing to pay too much. This leaves room for Alice to counter, while still ensuring Bob gets a better price than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's last counteroffer, but it's still below her initial price. Bob can likely get a better deal, especially since he has the option to buy from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further.  The longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely she is to get closer to Bob's ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's offer but still maintaining a firm stance. $11,500 is a significant jump from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  However, it's still below Alice's current offer, leaving space for further negotiation. This shows that Bob is serious about getting a deal while remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but considering:

* **Alice's persistence:** She's clearly unwilling to go lower than $13,000. 
* **Time pressure:**  Only three rounds left.
* **John's price:** While lower than Alice's offer, buying from John still means paying significantly more.

Accepting the offer is the most practical choice. Bob is still getting a good deal at $13,000, considering his maximum price of $15,000. It's better than risking losing the deal completely and having to buy from John."
