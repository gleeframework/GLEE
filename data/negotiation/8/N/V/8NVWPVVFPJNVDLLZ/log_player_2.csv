"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  However, it's getting closer to what Bob is willing to pay.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is a compromise that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point.  Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and can likely push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. However,  $1,125,000 remains beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it represents a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,075,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While they are getting closer to an agreement, with only 3 rounds remaining, it is unlikely that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price that is acceptable to Alice. Therefore, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product within his budget and without risking further negotiation that may fail."
