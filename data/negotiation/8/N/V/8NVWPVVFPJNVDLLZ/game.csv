"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
