"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This offer reflects its value to me and provides a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering your value of $800,000 and my value of $1,200,000, I believe a price of $875,000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows both of us to make a profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's work towards a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise. Let me know what you think!",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $912,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to both of us. Let me know what you think!",912500.0,Alice,7,
