"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the message in a positive and enthusiastic way to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for several rounds of negotiation without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 
* **Value to Me:** This product is worth significantly more than $9,000 to me, so I am not willing to settle for that price at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but still staying above Bob's initial offer.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a rationale for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product and the need for a price that works for both parties. 
* **Negotiation:** This offer sets the stage for further negotiation, hopefully leading to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, could we meet somewhere in between, perhaps at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $12,000 or even higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $15,000 would be the most profitable choice at this point, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I want to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This offer is exactly in between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $10,000. It shows a strong commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a desire to close the gap and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Given my budget constraints, could we aim for $10,750? This would allow us to reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Opportunity Cost:** With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory deal with Bob is increasing.
* **Time Pressure:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely it is that another buyer might emerge with a better offer, or that Bob could change his mind. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and also a significant amount of money.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiations with Bob might not yield a significantly better price, and it's not worth the potential risk of losing out on the guaranteed profit from John."
