Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll love. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($15,000) than to me ($8,000), I want to start with a strong offer closer to his perceived value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $13,000 is a high price, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate. 
* **Securing a significant profit:** Even if Bob negotiates the price down slightly, this offer ensures I still make a considerable profit above my minimum selling price to John."
