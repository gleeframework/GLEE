Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Justification:**  While not essential at this stage, vaguely mentioning ""value"" can plant a seed in Bob's mind about the product's worth.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is polite and open for discussion, encouraging Bob to engage rather than just flatly rejecting the offer.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, we can always negotiate down, knowing we have John as a backup buyer."
