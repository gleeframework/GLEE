"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good discount, it's still above Bob's target of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and try to secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the product and provides a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $950,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and provides a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant improvement from the initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter again and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'm prepared to pay $925,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price reflecting its value and allowing for a successful transaction. I'm confident this offer is reasonable and a good stepping stone towards a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for. My next counteroffer is $975,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise and reflects the product's value, while also being closer to your target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter again and potentially secure an even better price.  

**Important Note:**  Bob is still trying to reach a price below $900,000, and it's worth a few more rounds to see if Alice will budge further. However, if Alice continues to counteroffer at prices significantly above this target, Bob might consider buying from John to avoid further negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $940,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $975,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $940,000, which is $957,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

**Reasoning:**

**Important Note:** Bob is still trying to reach a price below $950,000. If Alice continues to counteroffer above this target, Bob should start considering buying from John to avoid further negotiation and save time."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've been willing to compromise throughout our negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $957,500. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to try to reach an agreement. My revised counteroffer is $955,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Close to Target:**  $955,000 is very close to Bob's target of $950,000.  While a perfect outcome is elusive, this is a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only one round left, the risk of rejection is high.  There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and rejecting the offer could lead to buying from John at a higher price.
* **Potential Cost of Rejection:** If Bob rejects and Alice doesn't counter, he'll likely have to buy from John, losing out on any further savings. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic move. It secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing out on a deal or being forced to buy from John at a higher cost."
