Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning a profit of $3,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob likely expects to pay less than $15,000, so this gives him room to counteroffer while still giving you a good price.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting at the absolute lowest price, suggesting you believe your product is valuable. 

We'll see what Bob's response is and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my ideal price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Would you consider $12,000?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Moves closer to Bob's offer:** This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Remains above your minimum:**  You're still earning a good profit.
* **Emphasizes value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth can sway him. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $11,500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely he won't go higher.  It's time to accept his offer and secure the sale."
