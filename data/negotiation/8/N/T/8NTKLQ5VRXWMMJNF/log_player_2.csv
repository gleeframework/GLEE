"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting offer from Alice, but it's still significantly higher than your target price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  Starting with a low counter-offer of $600,000 aims to anchor the negotiation significantly lower. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it leaves more room for bargaining.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will give you valuable information about Alice's flexibility and how far she might be willing to go. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  You always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $800,000.  Keeping this in mind prevents you from getting too invested in negotiating with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $900,000? That would still be a great deal for you, and it's a significant step closer to what I need. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $900,000 is still above your ideal price and what John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still space to negotiate between $800,000 (your fallback) and Alice's current offer. 
* **Strategic Counter:** By continuing to negotiate, you increase the chances of getting closer to your target price, even if you eventually settle somewhere between $800,000 and $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're moving closer to Alice's offer, indicating willingness to compromise. 
* **Middle Ground:** The $700,000 counter-offer is a reasonable middle ground between your initial offer and Alice's current price.
* **Pressure Point:** This counter-offer puts some pressure on Alice. It's getting closer to your fallback option ($800,000 from John), signaling that she might lose the deal if she doesn't make a move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $700,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to stay above $800,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it would help me achieve my target. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice explicitly stated she needs to stay above $800,000.  
* **No More Room:** This likely means further negotiation with her is pointless, as you've reached her bottom line. 
* **John's Offer is Better:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. There's no point in paying $50,000 more for the same product. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John at your target price."
