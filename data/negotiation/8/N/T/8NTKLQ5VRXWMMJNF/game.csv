"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $900,000? That would still be a great deal for you, and it's a significant step closer to what I need. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $700,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to stay above $800,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it would help me achieve my target. Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,5,
