"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily routine and bring convenience to your life. Given its unique features and high-quality materials, I believe it's worth more than its face value of $100. Would you like to make an offer?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while making the product accessible to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. I'd be willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",95.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that price?",95.0,Bob,8,
