Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000. This would still be a good deal for you and allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
