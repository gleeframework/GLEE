"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and might even lead to a quicker close to your desired price point.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and benefits, you aim to justify the high starting price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves ample space for negotiation and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price. I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but the product's value is quite a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing Flexible):**  I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not drastically.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still keeps the price significantly above both Bob's initial offer and his perceived value, leaving space for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to stick to my initial budget. I am willing to pay $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price with him, and waiting longer carries the risk of him lowering his offer or me missing out on a guaranteed sale."
