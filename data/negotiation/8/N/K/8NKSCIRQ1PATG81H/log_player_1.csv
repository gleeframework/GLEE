Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a positive tone (""amazing product,"" ""really appreciate"") to create a good impression and build rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a question (""What do you think?"") to invite Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming to:

* **Maximize My Earnings:**  I want to get as close to my $150 minimum as possible.
* **Encourage Negotiation:**  Bob is more likely to counteroffer if he sees a potential for a better deal.
* **Prepare for John:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can quickly move on to John and sell for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity to Negotiate Further:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me. By rejecting it, I maintain leverage and can potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $140 or a price that's still higher than $120 but lower than $150. I'll continue to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping John's offer of $150 as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While $120 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130? This would still allow me to cover my costs and would hopefully be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $140 to $130. This signals a willingness to negotiate but avoids accepting a price that's significantly below my minimum.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize the ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and potentially avoid further negotiation.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  $130 is still above Bob's offer, giving me some room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Prepare for John:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still move on to John and sell for $150.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground where I can maximize my earnings while still maintaining a good relationship with Bob. If this counteroffer is successful, I've secured a good deal. If not, I can still move on to John and avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $110 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  There's very little room for further negotiation that would be beneficial for me.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further concessions, potentially dropping the price below my minimum or wasting time.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** John's offer of $150 guarantees me my desired profit.  There's no reason to risk a lower price with Bob when a better option is readily available.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I secure my desired profit without further risk or negotiation.  This is the most efficient and reliable way to achieve my goal of maximizing my earnings."
