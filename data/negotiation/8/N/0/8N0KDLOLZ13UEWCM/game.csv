"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately,  $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, as it's well within my budget and closer to your desired price point. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
