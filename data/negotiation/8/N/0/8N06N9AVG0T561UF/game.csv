"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm confident this offer is mutually beneficial.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $15,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $16,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to offer $14,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $15,000.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Given the value of the product to me, I can only offer $14,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,6,
