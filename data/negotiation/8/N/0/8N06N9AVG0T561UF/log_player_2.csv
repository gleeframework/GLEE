Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $15,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $15,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, $15,500 is still over your budget. Since you have a backup option with John, it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price. You have 5 rounds left, and you might be able to reach a more favorable deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Given the value of the product to me, I can only offer $14,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $15,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $15,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It is not in my best interest to keep negotiating as I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. Therefore, I will choose to buy the product from John."
