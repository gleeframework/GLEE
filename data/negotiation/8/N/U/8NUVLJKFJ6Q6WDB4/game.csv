"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would be a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount from the original price, but I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go and still ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.
