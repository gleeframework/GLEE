"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $16000? It's a fair price for a product of this value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from you. How about we try $17000? It's a fair price for a product of this value, and I'm willing to consider it a final offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last push to try to get a better price. I'm thinking more like $18500 now. It's still a fair price for a product of this value, and I'm hoping you can see the value in it.",18500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're pushing the price up again, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer $16750 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",16750.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not sure we're going to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm willing to try one more time. I'm thinking $18000 is a fair price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's a good price for a product of this value, and I'm hoping you can see the value in it.",18000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand you're sticking to your price, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $18000. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",16000.0,Bob,10,
