,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $7,250 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,750? That's a fair price, and it gets us both closer to our desired outcome.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to bump my offer up a bit to $7,500. That's the best I can do. Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
