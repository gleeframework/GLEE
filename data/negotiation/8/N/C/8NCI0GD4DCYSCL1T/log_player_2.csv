Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He should counter with a lower offer to see if he can get it for even less."
