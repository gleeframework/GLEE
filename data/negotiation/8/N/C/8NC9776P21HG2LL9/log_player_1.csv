"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000.  It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I want to see if there's room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can always come down a bit, but I want to start strong to see if I can maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500. This is still a bit above Bob's initial price, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I might consider a slightly lower offer in the next round, but I want to see if he'll meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept it and close the deal.  While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's always the risk that he might reject my next offer or that the negotiations could drag on. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid any further complications."
