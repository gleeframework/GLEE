Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always advantageous to explore if we can get a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). However, it's still a substantial discount from John's guaranteed purchase price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial high offer allows for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can then decide if it's more profitable to accept his counter or proceed with John. 
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses positive and persuasive language to highlight the product's ""value proposition"" without explicitly mentioning its worth to Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while having the security of John's offer as a fallback option."
