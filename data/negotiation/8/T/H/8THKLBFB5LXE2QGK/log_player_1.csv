{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might find acceptable given the product's value to him. I've also included a friendly message to encourage a positive response.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $11,000 for this.  This is a one-time opportunity for a valuable product, and I believe it's worth the investment for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping for a better price, Bob is not budging much from his initial offer. Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe and guaranteed option. It's better than settling for $10,500 and getting less than what I consider the product's worth."
