Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's something that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  My starting price is $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a better deal. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $950,000 is my absolute floor.  This price still provides you with significant value and allows for a good margin for your business. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is closer to my range, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $925000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Since it's a fair price and I have already rejected his previous offers, I don't want to risk further negotiations. It's also important to remember that I have a backup offer from John for $800,000, so this deal with Bob is a win."
