# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $8,500. How about we try $9,750? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $9,200.  At this point, cutting your losses and taking the guaranteed $8,000 from John is the most financially sensible option."
