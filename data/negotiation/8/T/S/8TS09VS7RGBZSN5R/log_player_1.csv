Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $150, there's a chance Bob would accept a slightly lower price, netting you more profit than selling to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $140 is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still attractive compared to him not getting the product at all. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Creating a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
