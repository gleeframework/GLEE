Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer is still too high. I can still get the product from John for a better price, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer is still over my budget. While it's closer, it's still not worth it. I'll buy the product from John for $100, as that's within my price range."
