Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $10,000. I know this is a premium offer, but I believe the value you'll get from it is significant. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim to get at least that amount from Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While you could start at $10,000,  offering a slightly higher price allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Highlight value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to make the price more palatable. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
