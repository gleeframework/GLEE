"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his maximum price and can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can do better. I want to see if I can push him higher. I have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price of $8,000.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal. Accepting his offer secures the sale and ensures I meet my minimum profit goal."
