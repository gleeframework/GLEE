"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $87.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's counteroffer of $87.50 is closer to Bob's desired price of $85.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, and he might end up paying more.
* Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a price lower than buying from John and is a reasonable compromise."
