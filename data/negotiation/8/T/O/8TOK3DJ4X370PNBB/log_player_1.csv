Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has shown he's unwilling to go above his maximum perceived value of $100.  It's unlikely further negotiation will significantly increase his offer.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price of $150, maximizing profit."
