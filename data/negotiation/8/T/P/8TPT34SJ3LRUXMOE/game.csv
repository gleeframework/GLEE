"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a fair offer, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the best price I can offer at this time. Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
