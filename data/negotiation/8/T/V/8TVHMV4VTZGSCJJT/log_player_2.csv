"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is a good compromise and within Bob's budget. It's still cheaper than buying from John, and it's closer to the product's value to Alice, so it's likely a fair deal. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
