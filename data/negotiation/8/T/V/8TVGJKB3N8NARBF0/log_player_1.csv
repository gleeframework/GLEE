Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value for Bob:** $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000. This increases the likelihood of him accepting my initial offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $14,000, I have room to lower the price if needed.  If Bob counters, I can adjust my counter-offer based on his response. 
* **Plan B:**  I have a backup option with John, which allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still believe there's room for negotiation.  Bob has shown interest in the product, and he might be willing to pay a bit more than $12,500.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept his low offer.

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would still be a great price for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value for Bob:** $13,500 is still a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000. It's likely he'll see this as a reasonable compromise.
* **Avoiding John:** While I can sell to John for $15,000, I'm trying to maximize my profit.  I believe there's still a good chance of getting a better price from Bob with a bit more negotiation."
