"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would still be a great price for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
