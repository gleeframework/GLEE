"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a risk to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This still represents a good value for you, and it's the lowest price I can go. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this brings us closer to a fair deal for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with John's offer. Accepting this offer secures the deal and guarantees my minimum earnings. While there's always the possibility of a higher price, the risk of further negotiation is not worth it at this point."
