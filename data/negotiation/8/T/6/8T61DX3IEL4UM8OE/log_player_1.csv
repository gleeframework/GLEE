"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values it at $10,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to move down if necessary. I'm also leaving the door open for John's offer, as I can always sell to him if Bob doesn't come to terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm also keeping the option open to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's still a great price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 
 
I'm countering with $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and also a fair compromise. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to keep Bob engaged and potentially increase his willingness to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. That's a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for $15,000. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. I'm also keeping the option open to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to go lower than $14,000. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable investment.  Let's settle this now and get the deal done."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm sticking with a firm counteroffer of $14,000.  It's a good compromise, but also leaves room for Bob to potentially accept. I'm trying to close the deal by emphasizing the value of the product and emphasizing that it's a good time to settle.  I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. How about we meet at $13,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for $15,000. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. I'm also keeping the option open to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to find common ground. I'm sticking with my last offer of $14,000. If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm  making a final push with my previous offer of $14,000. I'm emphasizing the possibility of moving on to other buyers to create a sense of urgency and potentially nudge Bob to accept. I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to move on to other buyers, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, we're only two rounds away from the deal falling through. John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob.  It's the most sensible decision at this point in the process."
