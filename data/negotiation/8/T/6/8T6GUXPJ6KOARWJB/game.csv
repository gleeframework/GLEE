"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $980,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",980000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $960,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $970,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to save a significant amount. Let's close this deal.",970000.0,Alice,5,
