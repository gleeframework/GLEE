Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I made a mistake, I already decided to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. I should have chosen option 3 instead of making another counteroffer.

Since I already decided to buy from John, I'll just inform Alice that I'm not interested in making any more offers and I'll be buying from John.
