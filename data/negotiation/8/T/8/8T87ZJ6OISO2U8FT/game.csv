"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $80 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $100 is still a little higher than my budget. How about we split the difference at $90?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90 just yet. How about we meet at $95? I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to sacrifice too much of my profit margin.",95.0,Alice,5,
