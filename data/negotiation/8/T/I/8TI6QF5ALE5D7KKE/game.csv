"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $1,050,000. This price still allows for a good margin for you while acknowledging the product's worth. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $950,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's more in line with my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and the continued negotiation. $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the potential of the product. I'm prepared to make one final concession.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
