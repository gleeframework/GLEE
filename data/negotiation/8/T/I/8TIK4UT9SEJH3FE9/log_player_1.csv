Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth that much to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,750? I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are escalating too slowly.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed $10,000 offer within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut losses and take the sure thing with John."
