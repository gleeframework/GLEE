"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1100000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let me see what I can do. I can offer you a compromise at $1300000. This is a good price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I can go. How about $1250000? This is a fair price, and I believe it would allow us to close the deal. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I can offer you $1280000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
