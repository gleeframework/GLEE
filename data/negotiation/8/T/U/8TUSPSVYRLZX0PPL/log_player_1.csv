"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to secure a good deal while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While I do like the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is definitely too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the exact value of the product to him. This means I can't get a better price from him, and continuing the negotiation won't lead to a higher offer.  While I'd prefer to sell to John for $150, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
