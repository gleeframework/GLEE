"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value will exceed your expectations. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget allows for $900,000. If you're willing to work within that range, I think we have a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering your budget and the product's value, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's benefits.",925000.0,Alice,5,
