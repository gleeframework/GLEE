Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but still leaves room for you to make a profit. 
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you're not losing money right away.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This sets a professional tone for the negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9500 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum value, you still have room for a better deal.  You can likely get closer to your target price by making a counteroffer.  Here's why:

* **Bob's offer shows interest:** He's willing to negotiate, indicating he values the product and is likely open to further discussion.
* **You can still make a profit:**  $9,500 is above your minimum value, meaning you'd still be making a profit. 
* **Holding out for more:**  You can use John's offer as leverage in the next round. If Bob refuses your counteroffer, you can always go to John.

**Next steps:**

You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob. Consider a price slightly above his offer to show that you're willing to compromise, but still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a little closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? This would ensure we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.  
* **Maintain leverage:**  By suggesting a price just slightly above Bob's offer, you keep the negotiation moving and don't lose ground.
* **Consider John:** You're still within your acceptable profit margin, allowing you to walk away to John if Bob rejects again. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your desired price as possible while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I believe $9500 remains a fair price for the product. I hope we can agree on this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a decent price and Bob is persistent, the negotiation has stalled. Bob is unwilling to budge, and you're unlikely to get a better offer from him.  You have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, which is significantly more profitable and less risky.  

**Why choosing John is the best option:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** You're guaranteed a profit of $4,000, exceeding your minimum value and potentially leaving you with more money to reinvest.
* **Time efficiency:**  Negotiating further with Bob could take longer and might not lead to a higher offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  John's offer eliminates any uncertainty about the outcome of the deal.

**Conclusion:** 

Selling to John is the most sensible decision, as it maximizes your profit and minimizes risk."
