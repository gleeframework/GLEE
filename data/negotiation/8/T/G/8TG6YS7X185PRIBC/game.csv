"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $12,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, which would be $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
