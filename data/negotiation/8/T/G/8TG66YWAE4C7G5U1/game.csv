"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible. While I appreciate the offer, $11000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10500. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about we meet in the middle at $10750? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",10750.0,Alice,5,
