"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Significantly Lower:** Offering $80 is a significant drop from Alice's $175, but it's important to gauge her flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $120 is a significant improvement, it's still above your $100 limit and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation. You can try pushing Alice a little closer to your price point before accepting or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $100?  That's a fair offer considering the current market value."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:**  The message acknowledges Alice's compromise while directly stating your desired price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""current market value,"" you subtly imply that other options (like John's offer) exist.
* **Final Offer:**  Offering $100, your maximum price, puts the ball in Alice's court. It signals that you're serious about the purchase but won't go any higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $125, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unwilling to meet your $100 maximum price, and you've already reached your limit.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100. 
* **No Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price, and you risk losing out on the product entirely. 

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to buy the product from John at your target price."
