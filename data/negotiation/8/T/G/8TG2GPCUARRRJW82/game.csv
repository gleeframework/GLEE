"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $100?  That's a fair offer considering the current market value.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $125, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
