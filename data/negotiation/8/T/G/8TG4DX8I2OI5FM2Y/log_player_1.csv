"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you! I'm willing to let it go for $120, which is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good starting point, knowing Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $120 leaves some wiggle room for Bob to counteroffer, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum of $80. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I believe I can't pay more than $100 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is still a good deal for Bob:**  He values the product at $150, so a $100 offer is still a significant gain for him. 
* **Potential for higher price:** There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 
* **Avoiding immediate loss:**  Selling to John for $80 would be a quick sale but would mean leaving money on the table. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer while still getting me closer to my desired price.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me, I think $95 would be a fair price for us both. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$95 is still above my minimum:** I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired $120.
* **Potential for better deal:**  With several rounds remaining, there's a chance I can get a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not willing to settle for anything less than a price that's fair to me.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my previous counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $105 is halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's current offer of $95.
* **Reiterating win-win:**  I'm emphasizing the mutually beneficial nature of the offer to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this a lot of thought, and I believe $100 is the most I could realistically pay for this product. It's a fair compromise, considering its value to me. Let's aim for this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my desired price:** While I initially aimed for $120, $100 is a good deal considering the remaining rounds and the possibility of a stalemate. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  With only four rounds remaining, there's a risk of reaching a stalemate or losing the deal entirely.  
* **Opportunity cost:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the future. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
