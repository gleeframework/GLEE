"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to me, I'm extending this opportunity to you for $120. I understand it might be a bit above what you were expecting, but considering its worth, I believe this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering and potentially negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment.  I'm happy to offer you $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. Considering our previous discussion, I am willing to adjust the price to $110. I hope this meets within your budget while still reflecting the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still slightly above your budget but within a reasonable range.  Considering you could buy the product from John for $100, it's worth accepting Alice's offer as it's a good compromise. You're still saving $10 compared to John's price."
