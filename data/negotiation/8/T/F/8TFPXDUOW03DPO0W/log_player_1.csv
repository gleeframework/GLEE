Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the true worth of this item."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Option:** It's important to remember that Alice has John as a backup buyer. This means Alice doesn't have to settle for anything less than $10,000.

By starting high but reasonable, Alice increases her chances of maximizing her profit while still ensuring a successful sale."
