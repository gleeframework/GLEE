"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $175 is a little too steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $140? That's a fair compromise, and still a good deal for you.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  $140 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $130.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $125 is still a bit low for me. How about $135?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
