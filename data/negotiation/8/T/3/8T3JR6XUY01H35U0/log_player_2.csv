"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. This is a great deal considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You can do better than $100, as the product is worth only $80 to Alice.  Let's see if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This would be a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can squeeze a little more out of the deal before going to John.  $95 is still a bit high, but we're getting closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit too much for me. Let's try $92.50.  That's a good compromise and we can both move on. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
