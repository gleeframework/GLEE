Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going too high ($150) to give Bob a chance to counter without making me feel like I need to immediately sell to John.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity to counter:** I still have the opportunity to counter Bob's offer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **No immediate need to sell to John:** Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $115? That's still a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer in between:** I'm offering a price in between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reasoning provided:** I'm explaining my counteroffer with a reason to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Still above minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 was a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $110 is only $40 below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm willing to accept a small loss to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While $110 isn't ideal, I'm open to potentially negotiating further with Bob if he were to make another counteroffer.
* **Uncertainty with John:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome, but there's always a chance that he might back out of the deal or change his mind. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm taking a calculated risk, but it's a risk worth taking considering the potential for further negotiation with Bob and the uncertainty associated with John."
