Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $13,500.

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close to John's Price:** Alice is now at $13,500. While we could try to push further, we're getting very close to John's price of $10,000.
* **Time Constraint:** We have limited rounds left. If we keep negotiating and fail to reach an agreement, we might miss out on both Alice's and John's deals.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $13,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly less than Alice's initial offer and within a tolerable range of John's price.

It's better to secure the deal now at a price that's acceptable rather than risk losing the product altogether by pushing for a slightly lower price."
