"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110. This is still a great price for the value you'll get, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my time. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
