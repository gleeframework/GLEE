{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts in the middle ground between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110. This is still a great price for the value you'll get, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my time. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I am still seeking a lower price. I am now willing to pay up to $95 for the product. I hope this meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer and losing money on the sale."
