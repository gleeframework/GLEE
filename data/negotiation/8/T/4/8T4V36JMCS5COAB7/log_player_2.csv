"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. Since you are willing to pay up to $150, you have room to negotiate with Alice. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not desperate and willing to explore other options. This increases your chances of getting a lower price from Alice or even finding a similar product from another seller at a better price."
