"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it will bring you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is thoughtful, the product's value is significantly higher than that. I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business, so I'm proposing $1,150,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair reflection of the product's value to me. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation. It seems we both see the inherent value in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I value the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I believe $975,000 is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
