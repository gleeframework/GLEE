"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is lower than John's price of $15,000, it's still possible to negotiate a better deal. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a more competitive price. She might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
