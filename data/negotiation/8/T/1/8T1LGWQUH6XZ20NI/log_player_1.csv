Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're still focused on the bottom line. While I appreciate your interest,  $1,280,000 just isn't a workable number for me. I'm willing to budge a little more, but I need to be at $1,320,000. This gives you a great price and me a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1320000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is getting increasingly close to my minimum, but with only a few rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer is too high.  John's offer guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a safe and acceptable outcome."
