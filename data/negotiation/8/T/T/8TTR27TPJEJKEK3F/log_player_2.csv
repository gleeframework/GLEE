"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a rare and valuable item that I'm confident you'll appreciate. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Bob can reject Alice's offer and still get the product at his maximum price from John."
