"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential for your business.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
