Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $950,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob is already meeting me at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum. Accepting now secures a great profit."
