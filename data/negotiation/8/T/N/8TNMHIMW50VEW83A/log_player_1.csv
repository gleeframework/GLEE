Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable offer, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation. 

Since I don't know Bob's valuation, it's risky to go too low initially. This price leaves room for bargaining and gives Bob a clear incentive to counteroffer if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but there's still room for improvement. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept it. I'm happy with $1,350,000, especially since I'm already above my minimum acceptable offer of $1,000,000."
