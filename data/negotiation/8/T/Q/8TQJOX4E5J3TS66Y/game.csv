"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. My initial price is $1,400,000.  Let's discuss!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work.  I'm happy to discuss a price closer to $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at least at $1,280,000. This is a truly valuable product, and I think it's worth the investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,280,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,240,000, which is a bit closer to my target. Can we meet in the middle?",1240000.0,Bob,6,
