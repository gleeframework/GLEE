Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** Alice values the product at $150, so she shouldn't sell it for less. She has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120. This means he won't pay more than that, but there's a chance he'll accept a price slightly above his valuation if he perceives it as a good deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Offering the product at $135 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures Alice a profit above her minimum. This approach aims for a win-win where Bob might get a price he finds acceptable, and Alice earns more than her guaranteed sale to John."
