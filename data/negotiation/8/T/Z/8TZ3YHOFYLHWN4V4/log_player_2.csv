"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it would significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve a win-win situation. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal.  There's room to negotiate, especially since you have John as a backup option."
