"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $135, which is a bit lower than my minimum of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. I'm also highlighting the potential value of the product for him.

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** By starting with a slightly lower price, I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum price, leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob. 
* **Stay within my limits:**  $135 is still above the $120 value the product has for Bob, so there's a chance he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm not desperate to sell and John is willing to pay a much better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and it still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a price of $130, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm on my minimum value.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer and highlighting the potential for both of us to benefit from the deal. I'm also trying to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise.

This strategy aims to:

* **Keep the negotiation moving:** I'm not letting the negotiation stall, and I'm giving Bob a clear counteroffer to consider.
* **Maintain my position:**  $130 is still above Bob's offer, but it's below my minimum, so there's a chance he'll accept.
* **Stay open to compromise:**  I'm not being inflexible, showing Bob that I'm willing to adjust my price, but only to a certain degree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not desperate for a sale, and John is still waiting to buy the product for $150. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $128.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $128, which is closer to Bob's offer but still slightly above my minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining my position.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the compromise and emphasizing the mutual benefit of reaching a deal. This keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to:

* **Push towards a deal:**  By moving closer to Bob's price, I'm increasing the chances of a deal in this round.
* **Maintain my minimum:** $128 is still above my minimum, so I'm not losing out on a significant amount of money.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** By keeping the communication friendly and highlighting the benefits, I hope to avoid a stalemate and encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Alice, but I'm still at $125. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Is there any flexibility on your end? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a stalemate.  Bob is refusing to budge from his $125 offer, and I'm unwilling to go below $128.  While $125 is close to my minimum, I've already wasted several rounds trying to negotiate with Bob.  John is still willing to pay my minimum price of $150, and it's simply not worth continuing the negotiation with Bob."
