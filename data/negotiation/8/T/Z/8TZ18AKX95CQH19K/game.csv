"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a fantastic deal considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground! ",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,000 is a good offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about $13,750?  It's a compromise that reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",13750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,250. I think this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work!",13250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $13,250 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  Let's compromise at $13,500. This price reflects the product's value while giving us both a fair outcome.  Let's try to find common ground and finalize this deal!",13500.0,Alice,7,
