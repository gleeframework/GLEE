"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the value it can bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's still a significant discount from the original price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $775000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $800000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
