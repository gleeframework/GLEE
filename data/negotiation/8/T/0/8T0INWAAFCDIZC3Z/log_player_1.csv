Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
