Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more than that. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** This price point is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120), so it's unlikely he'll immediately accept. This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down slightly if needed, but still secure a profit higher than your alternative."
