"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my current financial situation, I am unable to commit to such a high price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  This product has the potential to generate substantial returns, and I wouldn't be comfortable letting it go for less than $1,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a price point that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, and I respect your position on the product's value. However, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
