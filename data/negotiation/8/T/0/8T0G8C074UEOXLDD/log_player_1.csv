{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone by calling it a ""fair price."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not ready to accept. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,325,000 for your product. I believe this price is fair for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum value that it's worth accepting. I don't want to risk him walking away or me having to sell to John and get a slightly lower profit."
