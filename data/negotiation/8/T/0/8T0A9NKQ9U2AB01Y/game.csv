"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $850,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  That said, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a price of $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
