"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm open to offers, but I know it's worth at least $150 to me.  Would you be interested in buying it for $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum, giving Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **Reasoned Offer:** I'm providing a reason for the price to make it seem more legitimate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, but not desperate. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm creating space for Bob to make a counteroffer, while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering $130, which is still below my minimum of $150.
* **Negotiating Room:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option to sell to John for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might push him closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a good deal for both of us, and it still allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not cave in completely.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that the offer is a good deal for both of us.
* **Keeping Options Open:** I'm not committing to a final decision, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $132.50. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has moved closer, his offer of $132.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity to Improve:** I believe I can still push for a better price. I'm not in a rush to sell and have the option of selling to John for a higher price.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $132.50 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $134 to make this work. That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 134} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer again, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while staying firm on my minimum.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my goal.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating that this price represents a fair compromise for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Negotiation Continuation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, but also expressing confidence that $134 is a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to a deal, but $134 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $133, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Even with Bob's increased offer, $133 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Close but Not Enough:** While we're getting closer, I'm not desperate to sell.  I can still try to get a better deal.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I'm confident that I can still push for a higher price, especially considering I can sell to John for $150.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I want to see if I can get Bob to come up even a small amount more by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go higher.  However, $133 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: $133.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us to close the deal.  I'm confident you'll agree that it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 133.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer again, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while staying firm on my minimum.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that the offer is a good price for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm expressing confidence that this offer will close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $133, and I think that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $133. Can we finalize the deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited.
* **Unwavering Price:** Bob is firm on his offer of $133.  
* **Better Option:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a significantly better price than what I'm likely to get from Bob.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  By selling to John, I'm avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price or no deal at all. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed higher price with John rather than risk a lower price or no deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
