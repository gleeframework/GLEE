Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value it offers you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price based on the value to Bob, hoping to avoid an immediate rejection.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential compromise.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also fostering a positive negotiation dynamic with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $700,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it provides an opportunity for me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Potential for compromise:**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't necessarily mean ending the negotiation. It allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control over the negotiation and have the opportunity to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the significant value this product brings to you. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving from my initial offer of $950,000 to $850,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to incentivize him to come closer to my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open and productive.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a firm stance on my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not able to meet your previous offer at $850,000. However, I would like to propose $800,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with the value you see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 aligns perfectly with my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further room for negotiation:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price, especially considering the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Secure the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful transaction and allows me to secure the sale without risking a lower price or a lost deal.

While I would ideally prefer a higher price, securing a sale at my minimum acceptable price is the most sensible decision, given the current negotiation context."
