Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm offering it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price well above your minimum. 
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Offering it directly to Bob first provides you with a degree of time savings and certainty compared to going straight to John.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome."
