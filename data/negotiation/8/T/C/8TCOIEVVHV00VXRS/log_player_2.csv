"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $100.  
* **Potential Savings:** You could potentially get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering. 
* **Jhon's Price:** $120. This is your maximum budget, so rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option of buying from Jhon open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  Start with a significant counter-offer to test Alice's flexibility and show your willingness to negotiate. 
* **$80:** This is a significant price reduction from $100, but still leaves room for potential compromise. 
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing interest, setting the stage for a potential agreement."
