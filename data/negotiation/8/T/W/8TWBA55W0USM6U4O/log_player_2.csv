(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $125 is a bit too low for me, I could be persuaded to part with it for $135. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $135 is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price without having to buy from John at a higher price."

Round 4

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice.  $135 is closer, but how about we split the difference at $130? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
