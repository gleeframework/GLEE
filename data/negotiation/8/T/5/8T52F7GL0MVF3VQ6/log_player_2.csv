"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum budget of $800,000. Offering $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and represents a reasonable starting point for negotiations. This counteroffer is aggressive but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly above Bob's target. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. There are still many rounds left, and he can always choose to buy from John if he's unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product. $900,000 is still within his budget and represents a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest one. This allows for further negotiation while keeping the deal within reach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's target price. He has already shown willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to his budget, so rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer makes sense. He has already demonstrated that he's willing to walk away, so Alice may be more inclined to compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to his budget with each offer.  $950,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, bridging the gap between his previous offer and Alice's latest price. This shows continued commitment while still keeping the deal within his budget.  The pressure is now on Alice to accept, knowing that Bob can walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his budget. Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and has already shown that he's prepared to walk away if necessary.  With only a few rounds left, rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer is a calculated risk. The goal is to put more pressure on Alice to accept a price closer to Bob's limit. If Alice continues to be stubborn, then Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his budget.  Offering $975,000 shows a genuine effort to compromise while still preserving his financial interests.  This offer puts the pressure on Alice to either accept a price closer to Bob's limit or risk losing the deal. If Alice rejects again, Bob has only one more round to negotiate before having to make a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob. Even though he's made significant progress in bringing the price down, he's unlikely to get it any lower in this final round.  With only one round left, it's a risk to reject this offer and try for a lower price. If Alice rejects Bob's counteroffer, he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

Therefore, the most prudent decision is to buy the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of potentially ending up paying a higher price after further negotiation with Alice."
