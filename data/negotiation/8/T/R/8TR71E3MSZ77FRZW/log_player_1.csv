Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your needs and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm willing to part with it for $925,000."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, the goal is to capture as much of that surplus as possible while ensuring Bob still sees value in the deal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for Alice ($125,000 above her minimum) while still giving Bob a $75,000 discount compared to his perceived value.
* **John as a Safety Net:** The presence of John guarantees Alice at least $800,000, giving her leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
