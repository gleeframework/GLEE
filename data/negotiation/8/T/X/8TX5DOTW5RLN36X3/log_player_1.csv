Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,200,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,200,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the offer more enticing.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000."
