Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations with Bob at a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies there's competition (""interest I've had"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room:**  While the price is ambitious, it's not so high as to be insulting. It allows Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than your minimum. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You get a great deal at $19,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price, potentially still getting more than $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You move on to John and sell at your minimum acceptable price."
