"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price given the value we both see in the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a revised price of $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm only able to go up to $750,000 at this time.  This is a fair price, given the value we both see in the product and my own budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer you a revised price of $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
