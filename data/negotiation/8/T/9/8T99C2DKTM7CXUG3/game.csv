"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000. I think $1,000,000 is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
