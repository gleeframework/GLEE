Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit. If this isn't workable, I'll have to go with another option.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and ensure a guaranteed sale at my desired price point."
