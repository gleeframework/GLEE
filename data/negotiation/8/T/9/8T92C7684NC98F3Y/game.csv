"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $8500 is a reduction from your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7500. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $8000?  That's still above your last offer, but it's also a significant reduction from my last one.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7200. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm getting close to walking away if we can't come to an agreement.",7200.0,Bob,6,
