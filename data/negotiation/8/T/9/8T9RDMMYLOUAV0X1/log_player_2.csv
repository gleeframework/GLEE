"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a fair price, given the product's value to both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is worth less to her. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice in a subsequent round."
