"Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a fair price, given the product's value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
