"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge how eager Bob is to buy the product and how much he values it. 
* **Fallback Option:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for bolder negotiation tactics. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing potential profit while acknowledging the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own valuation of the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation.  While selling to John for $800,000 is tempting, it's worth exploring if Bob is willing to move closer to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, $650,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still reflects the exceptional potential and worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  The counteroffer of $900,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but remains significantly above Bob's offer.  This tests his flexibility and signals the product's high value.
* **Anchoring:**  By staying closer to the initial high price, the negotiation remains anchored around a higher point, potentially influencing Bob to make more substantial counteroffers.
* **Time Consideration:** With several rounds remaining, there's still opportunity to negotiate, but remaining firm early on is crucial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $720,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, now at $720,000. This indicates he's willing to negotiate. However, accepting this offer would still mean losing out on a potential $80,000 compared to selling to John.  There's still room for negotiation to bridge the gap, and rejecting now maintains a stronger bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to consider $850,000. This reflects the value of the product while recognizing your interest."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Movement:** The counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant drop from the previous $900,000 but still stays above John's offer and well above Bob's. This demonstrates a willingness to find an agreement.
* **Midpoint Negotiation:**  This price aims to settle near the midpoint between the previous offers, encouraging Bob to see it as a fair compromise. 
* **Time Pressure:** With half the rounds remaining, applying gentle pressure by gradually reducing the price can nudge Bob toward a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  I'd be willing to offer $780,000 to close this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains:** Bob's offer of $780,000 is only $20,000 less than John's guaranteed offer. Continuing negotiations for such a small potential gain is risky.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's incremental increases and language like ""getting closer to my limit"" suggest he may not be willing to move much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob for a small potential upside wastes valuable time that could be used to finalize the deal with John.

At this point, securing a guaranteed $800,000 from John is the most logical and profitable decision."
