Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount of money for Bob, but it also leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my goal, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to make a profit well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $920,000. While it's still below my initial goal, it's a good profit and a safe bet.  I've learned that Bob is willing to negotiate, but he has a hard limit.  It's better to secure this deal than risk another round of counteroffers and potentially lose out to John's offer."
