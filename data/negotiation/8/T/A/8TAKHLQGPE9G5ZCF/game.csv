"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a competitive offer considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this price reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to negotiate the price. However, I need to make a profit, and $600,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I understand it's a good deal, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That's a fair offer considering the value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"I see you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value to you is $800,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, so this is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,,
