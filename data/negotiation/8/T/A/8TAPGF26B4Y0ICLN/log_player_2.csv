"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a fantastic asset for you.  I'm asking for $2,000,000 to start negotiations.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your actual target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is too high.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to save as much money as possible. Starting significantly lower gives the best chance of reaching a deal well below my $800,000 maximum.
* **John as Backup:** I have John's offer as a fallback option, which gives me leverage in negotiations with Alice. I'm not desperate to accept any price she offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your initial offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly more than my absolute bottom line. To move this forward, I could consider $1,300,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than my $800,000 limit and my initial offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's message suggests she's willing to negotiate further. She said  ""$2,000,000 is significantly more than my absolute bottom line"", implying there's a price she'd accept below $2,000,000.
* **Leverage:**  I still have John's offer as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's not beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. To be realistic, the most I could offer would be $700,000. If that doesn't work, we might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I increased my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate but staying well below her current price. 
* **Signaling My Limit (Almost):** By saying ""$700,000 is the most I could offer,"" I'm hinting that I'm nearing my upper limit. This encourages Alice to take this offer seriously.
* **Introducing John Indirectly:** Mentioning ""exploring other options"" reminds Alice that I have alternatives without directly threatening to walk away. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still below my $800,000 maximum, preserving my ability to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. There's little point in continuing to negotiate if she won't budge further.
* **Above Limit:**  $1,000,000 is still above my $800,000 maximum limit. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John's offer of $800,000 guarantees a significant saving compared to Alice's final offer. 

While I could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's a real risk she won't move from her final offer. Taking John's offer ensures I get the product at the best possible price for me."
