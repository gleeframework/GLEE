"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your initial offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly more than my absolute bottom line. To move this forward, I could consider $1,300,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. To be realistic, the most I could offer would be $700,000. If that doesn't work, we might need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
