"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $12,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a great deal on a product that's worth $15,000 to you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $15,000. This gives you room to negotiate a better price with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
