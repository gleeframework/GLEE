"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. However, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise,  let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's fair to me.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, while I appreciate your counteroffer, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? This would give us both a fair deal and hopefully bring us closer to an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,5,
