Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts.
* **Justify the Price:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"" aims to subtly justify the higher price.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject the offer at $12,000. However, it's a calculated risk to maximize your potential profit. You can always adjust your strategy in future interactions if needed."
