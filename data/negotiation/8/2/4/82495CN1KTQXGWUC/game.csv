"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  I think it's a fair price considering it has a lower value for me than for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I understand the product has a different value for you, but I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
