Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I understand the product has a different value for you, but I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
