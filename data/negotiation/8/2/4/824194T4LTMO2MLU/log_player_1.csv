Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This price point is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob gets from the product. 

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, I increase the likelihood of him accepting the initial offer. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary, keeping the $8,000 offer from John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is better than John's $8,000, it's still below my ideal price point and the value of the product to Bob. I believe I can negotiate a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and allows me to potentially close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express a willingness to negotiate. I also reiterate the value of the product to him, hoping to nudge him towards accepting my counteroffer.

By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm not going to simply accept his first offer."
