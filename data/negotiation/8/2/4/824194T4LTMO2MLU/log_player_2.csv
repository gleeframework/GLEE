"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $12000 to you! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get an even better price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is a good deal for Bob.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that John will raise his price. It's better to secure this deal and save $1,500 compared to buying from John."
