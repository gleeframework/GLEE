"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've made significant concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to take a firmer stance. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to exploring other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
