"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $12,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is a better price than $12,000, there's still room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get it lower by making another counteroffer."
