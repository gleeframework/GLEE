"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for you. I've carefully assessed its worth, and given its potential impact, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is the best move in round 1. While $1,400,000 is within your budget, you have room to negotiate and potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to control the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer, and I'm willing to move slightly from my initial price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to your target price, you're still within your budget and there's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and potentially leads to a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm still at $1,250,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  How about we settle at $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your price, and you're within your budget. This is a good compromise, and you're likely not to get a much lower offer. It's better to secure the product now before the negotiations drag on."
