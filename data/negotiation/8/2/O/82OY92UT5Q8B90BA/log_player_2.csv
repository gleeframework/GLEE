"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the investment for you. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's no rush to accept a wildly overpriced offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. I'm open to discussing it further, but I need to see a more significant increase in your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,550,000 is still above your budget. You have more rounds to negotiate, and John is offering a significantly lower price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,550,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $1,350,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and a good compromise considering the value you place on the product. I'm confident we can finalize this deal if we find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. I'm confident we can finalize this deal if we can find a bit more common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,450,000 is still above your budget. You still have several rounds left, and John is a viable alternative.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a very fair price, considering your asking price has dropped and I'm still well above your minimum valuation.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and the progress we've made.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal quickly. Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, $1,425,000 is still more than you want to pay. You have three rounds left to negotiate, and John is offering a much lower price. It's worth trying to get Alice down even further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're almost there. I'm willing to go to $1,410,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer and a very fair price considering we're both close to our target. Let's finalize this deal in this round to avoid further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1410000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're so close to finalizing this deal!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,415,000. This is a fair compromise that ensures we both get what we need.  Let's close this deal now and avoid any further rounds of negotiation.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,415,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,415,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, you only have one round left. It's highly likely that Alice will not agree to your counteroffer in the final round, leaving you with no deal. John is offering a guaranteed price that is well within your budget. It's more prudent to secure the deal with John at this point."
