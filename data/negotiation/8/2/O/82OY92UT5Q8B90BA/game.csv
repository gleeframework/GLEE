"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. I'm open to discussing it further, but I need to see a more significant increase in your offer.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,550,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $1,350,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and a good compromise considering the value you place on the product. I'm confident we can finalize this deal if we find some common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. I'm confident we can finalize this deal if we can find a bit more common ground.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a very fair price, considering your asking price has dropped and I'm still well above your minimum valuation.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiation.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the progress we've made.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal quickly. Let's get this done!",1425000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're almost there. I'm willing to go to $1,410,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer and a very fair price considering we're both close to our target. Let's finalize this deal in this round to avoid further negotiation.",1410000.0,Bob,8,
