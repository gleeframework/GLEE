"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $750000. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm proposing a new price of $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",875000.0,Alice,5,
