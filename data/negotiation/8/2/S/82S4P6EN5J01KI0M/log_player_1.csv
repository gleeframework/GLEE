Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  Offering $10,000 leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer. I'm not too aggressive, as I don't want him to immediately reject my offer.
* **Value for Both:**  $10,000 is a good compromise. It's above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Preparing for John:** I'm aware of John's $12,000 offer, and I'll use that as a backstop if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I cannot accept it. 
* **John's Offer is Better:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $12,000.  Selling to John is the best option if I can't get a better price from Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I will reject Bob's offer, but I will counteroffer him to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a great product, and it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'm not losing money. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my price point.  If he rejects this offer, I'll consider selling to John."
