"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price.  You can counteroffer with a lower price, and she might be willing to come down.  You have a bit of room to negotiate, as buying from John would cost $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $725,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $725,000 is a good deal for you. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a much better price."
