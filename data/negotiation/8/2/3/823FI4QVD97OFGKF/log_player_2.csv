"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This represents a significant value for you, as it's well below the estimated $1,500,000 I'd receive from another buyer. It's a win-win scenario, allowing you a great deal and me to secure a sale quickly. Let me know your decision, and we can proceed accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  He can get the product from John for a much lower price, saving him a significant amount of money."
