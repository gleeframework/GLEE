"Alice, your product is certainly intriguing, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I understand your position. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $850,000. Our product is unique and valuable, and I believe it deserves a higher valuation. I would like to propose $900,000 as a more reasonable price for you to consider. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I understand the value of your product, $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After reviewing your latest offer, I've decided to counter with $890,000. This reflects a compromise while still valuing the product appropriately. I believe this figure will be acceptable for both parties and I look forward to your response.",890000.0,Alice,5,
