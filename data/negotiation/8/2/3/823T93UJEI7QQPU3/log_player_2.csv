"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for my asking price. Let's start with $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a better price than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend closer to $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum value of $120, but also wants to be fair and show a willingness to negotiate. $105 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer. This strategy allows Bob to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we set the price at $107? This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107 is close to Bob's desired price of $105.  Accepting this offer is the best option for Bob. 

* **Pros of accepting:**
    * Saves $5 compared to buying from John.
    * Secures the product without risking further negotiation.
* **Cons of rejecting:**
    * Risks Alice raising the price or becoming less willing to negotiate.
    * Wastes a round and increases the chances of having to buy from John at a higher price. 

Given the limited rounds and the potential for a worse outcome, accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
