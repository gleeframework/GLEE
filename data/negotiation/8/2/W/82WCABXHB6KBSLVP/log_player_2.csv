"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let you have it for $120. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is above your budget and what you'd pay John. It makes more sense to see if she'll lower the price or buy from John for $100."
