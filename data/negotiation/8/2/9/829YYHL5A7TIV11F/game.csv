"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I agree it's valuable, $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $10500.  That's a fair price considering the value to me and your desired price.  Let's close the deal!",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10750. This is a small compromise, but it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
