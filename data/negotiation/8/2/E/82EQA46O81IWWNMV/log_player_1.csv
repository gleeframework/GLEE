"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" and highlighting the product's potential benefit to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using open-ended language (""Let me know what you think"") to encourage Bob to counteroffer and start the negotiation. 

This strategy balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and even lower than my initial offer.  While it's tempting to accept $6,000 given the risk of losing the deal completely, it's crucial to remember the following:

* **My Minimum:**  I've stated I won't sell for less than $15,000. Accepting $6,000 would be a major loss for me.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a higher price, potentially finding a middle ground. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low. Considering the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not all the way. A $9,000 price point shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant profit for myself.
* **Highlight Value Again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my counteroffer and emphasize its potential benefits to him.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:** The message is positive and focuses on finding a solution (""Let's see if we can make this work""). This helps maintain a positive tone and encourages further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while staying within my acceptable price range. It demonstrates flexibility while keeping me in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to $7,500? That would be a great price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. Here's why I'm rejecting this offer:

* **My Minimum:** I've already stated that I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. Accepting $7,500 would be a big loss for me.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a higher price and explore the possibility of a more mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **John's Offer:** Knowing that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob. I'm not desperate to sell at this price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($7,500). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value and frame the offer as a ""good outcome"" for both of us.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and negotiation.

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise while staying within my acceptable price range. It demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
