"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being positive and emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, setting the stage for a back-and-forth.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for compromise.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation ($10,000), it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000. This still gives you a great price, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000. 
* **Reiterating value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit.
* **Continuing negotiation:** I'm keeping the conversation open and giving Bob an opportunity to respond.

By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,200 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's still lower than my ideal price, it's a good deal considering I have limited rounds left.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing Bob entirely and being forced to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Time Factor:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to secure a deal, even if it's not the absolute best outcome.

Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $15,200."
