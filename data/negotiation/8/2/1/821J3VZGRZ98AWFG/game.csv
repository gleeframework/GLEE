"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,000,000. I understand it's worth less to you than to me, but I believe this price still represents a good value for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price.  ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
