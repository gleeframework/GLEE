"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product! It's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My starting price is $1200000. Let's discuss and see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1100000? This gives us both a good deal and allows me to recoup some of the value I placed on this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
