Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $8,000 as John provides that safety net.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting high allows you to potentially capture the most value. If you start too low, you leave money on the table. By offering it at $11,000, you leave some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for yourself. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup gives you leverage. You don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
