"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I can do $95, which is closer to my minimum price than $90. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $92.50. This is a fair price considering how close we are to a deal.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can do $92.75, which is just a bit above your latest offer. What do you think?",92.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to my budget. How about we settle on $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",90.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $90, Bob. I think we've been over that price already. I'm willing to make one final offer: $92.50. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,9,
