Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can do $92.75, which is just a bit above your latest offer. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. Although we're getting closer, I'm determined to get the product for $80 or less. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, but I'm also keeping in mind the option of buying from John for $80 if I can't get a better price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to my budget. How about we settle on $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go back to $90, Bob. I think we've been over that price already. I'm willing to make one final offer: $92.50. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5.

```

Alice is unwilling to budge below $92.50, and I've already made several counteroffers.  I'm getting tired of this negotiation, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Alice. I'm going to buy the product from John for $80."
