# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $15,000. My proposal is to offer this exceptional product to you for $12,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between its worth and the price. This opportunity won't last long, so I encourage you to consider my offer promptly. Should you have any questions or need more information, please let me know. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
