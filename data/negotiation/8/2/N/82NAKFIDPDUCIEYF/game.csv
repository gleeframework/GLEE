"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  Let's split the difference.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $11,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
