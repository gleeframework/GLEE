Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Language:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not satisfied with the initial price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good price and a sale.
* **Bob Rejects and Makes Counteroffer:** I'll analyze the counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable or if I want to make another counteroffer. I'll also consider if it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob or if it's time to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000 provides me with leverage in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still within a range that could be acceptable to Bob. 
* **Monitor the Negotiation:** I'll closely watch how Bob reacts to my counteroffer and be prepared to adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Selling to John:** If the negotiation with Bob stalls or I feel like I'm not getting close to my target price, I'll sell to John for $10,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 for the product. This is still a fantastic value for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the ""fantastic value"" the product represents for Bob, even at the lower price.
* **Call to Action:**  I'm asking Bob for a clear response, encouraging him to accept or make another counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**
