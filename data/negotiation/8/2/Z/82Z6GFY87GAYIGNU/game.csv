"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While the product seems valuable, $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $7,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'll meet you at $7,100. This is the last concession I'm willing to make. If you're willing to meet me here, I'll sell the product to you.",7100.0,Alice,7,
