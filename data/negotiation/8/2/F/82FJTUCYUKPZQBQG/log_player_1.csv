Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $100 is less than Bob's value of $120, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **It's a fair offer:** The offer is within the range of potential prices, making it a starting point for a friendly negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is less than my initial offer, it's still a profit for me, and accepting his counteroffer means a quick sale and avoids further negotiation."
