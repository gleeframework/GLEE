"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next rounds, and selling to John guarantees me the same amount."
