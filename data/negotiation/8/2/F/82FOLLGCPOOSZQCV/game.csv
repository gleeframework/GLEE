"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget of $15000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $10000. How about we compromise at $10500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",10400.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target.
