"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
