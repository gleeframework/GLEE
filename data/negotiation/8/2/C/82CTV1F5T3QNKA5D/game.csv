"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $16,000? This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
