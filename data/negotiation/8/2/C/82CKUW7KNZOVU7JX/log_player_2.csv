"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You are trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is far above your $800,000 limit.  You should reject and counter-offer to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you a decent profit margin. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,200,000 is still above your budget. You should reject and make another counteroffer, trying to push her closer to your target price. There's still room for negotiation, and you don't want to settle for a price that's too high."
