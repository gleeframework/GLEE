Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find something similar for a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is at the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $150 is really my bottom line. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $162.50? This way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 162.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of your product, I still believe I can find a comparable item for a lower price. I would like to stick to my original offer of $150. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his $150 offer, and while I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing more time.  John is a guaranteed sale at $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on."
