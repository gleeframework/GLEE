Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of immense value to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the significant returns you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and we have a guaranteed sale at that price with John. This gives us significant leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a higher price ($1,500,000), we anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to our desired outcome than starting lower.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique"" nature and ""significant returns"" adds perceived value, making the higher price more palatable. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  There's room for negotiation based on Bob's response. The key is to remain firm on the product's value while being open to a mutually beneficial agreement."
