"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  $11,000 is too low, and I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $12,500? This price would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to purchase the product immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum threshold of $12,000 and a decent compromise. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
