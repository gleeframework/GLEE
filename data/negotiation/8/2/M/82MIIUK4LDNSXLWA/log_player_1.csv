"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  This is the most I can afford right now. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and doesn't seem willing to budge significantly.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll reach a price close enough to the $15,000 John is offering. It's better to take the guaranteed offer now than risk getting stuck in a stalemate with Bob."
