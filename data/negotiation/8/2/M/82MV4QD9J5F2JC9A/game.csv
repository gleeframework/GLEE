"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,250?  This would still leave you some room to profit and would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
