Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,250?  This would still leave you some room to profit and would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer matches your maximum budget. There's no benefit to trying to negotiate further or going with John, as both options will cost you $8,000."
