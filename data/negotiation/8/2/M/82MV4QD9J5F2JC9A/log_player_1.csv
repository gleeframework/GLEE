Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for my budget though. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$7,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,250?  This would still leave you some room to profit and would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
