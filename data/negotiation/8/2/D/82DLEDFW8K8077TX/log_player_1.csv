Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still allows me to make a profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $10,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it still ensures I make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
