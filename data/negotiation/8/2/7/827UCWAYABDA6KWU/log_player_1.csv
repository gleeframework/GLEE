"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening offer, and I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better understanding of his valuation and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise, as it's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum value. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and might be enticing enough for Bob to accept, especially considering he already rejected a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'll reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round. There are still several rounds left, and I'm not yet ready to settle for a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum value of $800,000. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I believe he might be willing to pay this amount.  It's a fair price, considering my minimum, and with John as a backup, I'm confident in holding my ground."
