Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. It also gives Bob room to negotiate if he's willing to pay more than his estimated value of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $9,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product above his offer. This gives him a small amount of room to negotiate further while still keeping me closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum.  It's also a higher price than I initially expected to get from Bob.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a higher price, but it's also possible that Bob will walk away, leaving me with no sale. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but it's lower than what I can get from Bob right now.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most beneficial decision in this situation."
