Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Starting High:** A higher initial offer gives you bargaining room if Bob tries to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While aiming high, the message also acknowledges Bob's potential perspective (""you'll find it worthwhile"") and leaves the door open for discussion.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time and flexibility. If you need to sell the product quickly, a lower, more competitive offer might be more suitable."
