Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I would sell it to John for. This is a good starting point because it shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price, but it's also a price that I'm willing to negotiate down from if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is still higher than what Bob offered, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. It's also a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, which gives me some room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still too low, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.  Since I can get $150 from John, I'll sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
