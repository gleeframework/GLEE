Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $90. It's a steal at that price!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers.  I'm also trying to be persuasive by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $65 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $75, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $75, which is still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise for Bob, and I'm trying to keep the negotiation moving forward by being flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product. How about we meet in the middle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $70 is a good price for me, considering my minimum is $80 and I've already spent some time negotiating. It's important to be realistic and not always hold out for the highest price, especially when you have a backup buyer like John."
