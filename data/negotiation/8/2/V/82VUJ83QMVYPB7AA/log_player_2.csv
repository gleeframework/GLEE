It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $75 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $60. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  I'll see if she's willing to negotiate further."

$70 is still a bit high.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm still holding out for a lower price.  $72 is better than $75, but I'm not yet ready to accept."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to meet Alice halfway again and offer $68. This is a good compromise and hopefully, she'll finally accept."

Alice is being stubborn and not budging on her price. I've already tried to negotiate a fair price for several rounds and it's not working.  I'm going to buy the product from John to avoid wasting more time."
