"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to consider purchasing the product for $850,000. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, though $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $900,000. Would you be willing to go down to $875,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",875000.0,Bob,4,
