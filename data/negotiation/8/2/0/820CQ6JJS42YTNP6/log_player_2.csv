"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your profit margin. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum price of $1,000,000.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is offering the product for your maximum price. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps you in a better position to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,030,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than your maximum price, and with only 5 rounds left, there's a risk of not being able to close the deal at a price you're comfortable with. Buying from John guarantees you get the product for your maximum price, saving you time and potential frustration in further negotiations."
