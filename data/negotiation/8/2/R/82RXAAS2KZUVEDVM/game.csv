"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for $600,000. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the potential savings you'll have by closing the deal quickly.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly. ",750000.0,Bob,4,
