Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too far below what I need to make this deal work.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's find that common ground and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  You can also consider buying from John as a backup option if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
