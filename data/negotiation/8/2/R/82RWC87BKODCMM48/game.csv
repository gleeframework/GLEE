"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,250,000 at this time. This price is still above my maximum budget, but I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000, reflecting the value this product brings and the opportunity for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's find that common ground and make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
