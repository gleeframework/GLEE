"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```explanation: Alice's first offer is only slightly below my maximum price. I should reject and counter-offer to see if I can get a lower price.```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategy:**  Start with a counter-offer significantly below Alice's asking price but still well above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal.
* **Reasoning:** 
    * Alice's starting price is very close to my maximum.  There's little incentive for me to accept it.
    * By countering aggressively, I signal that I'm serious about getting a lower price. 
    * Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets a lower anchor point for future rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Explanation:**

* Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still too high. 
* We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and buying from John is still an option.
* By continuing to reject, I signal that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it work if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}

**Explanation:**

* **Split the difference (almost):**  I'm moving closer to Alice's price, but not by a huge margin. Splitting the difference between the last two offers would be around $1,012,500. Offering $975,000 keeps me below $1 million, which feels psychologically important.
* **Express budget concerns (again):** By reiterating my budget limitations, I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency for Alice to make a deal.
* **Show willingness (with conditions):**  I want Alice to know I'm serious but only at the right price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $1,010,000, which is a compromise that I'm comfortable with. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Explanation:**

* **""Final offer"" tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her final offer. It's likely not her true bottom line, and there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Slow progress:** The price is moving down, but very slowly.  I need to increase the pressure.
* **John as leverage:**  I haven't used the John option as leverage yet. It might be time to signal that I'm seriously considering it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but honestly, at $1,010,000, I might as well buy from John. He's offering the same product for $1,200,000, and while I prefer to work with you, the price difference is becoming too significant to ignore. To make this work, I need you to come down a bit more. How about $990,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 990000}

**Explanation:**

* **Introduce John:** I'm putting John on the table as a credible alternative. This adds pressure on Alice without being a direct threat to walk away.
* **Justify the price:** By mentioning John's offer, I'm implicitly justifying my lower counteroffer.
* **Firm but fair:**  I'm stating my final offer while still acknowledging Alice's efforts and leaving a small window for her to meet me in the middle.
* **Strategic positioning:** By taking a strong stance in this round, I aim to either secure a favorable price or push Alice to reveal her true bottom line in the upcoming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're considering John's offer, and I don't want to lose the sale. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $990,000. I can meet you at $1,005,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping you'll see the value in this product and be willing to make the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Minimal gains:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has shown very little movement in her price and is now only $5,000 away from my previous offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has a high risk of failure at this point. Alice might hold firm, and I'd be forced to either buy from John at a much higher price or risk not getting the product at all.
* **Good enough deal:**  $1,005,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly less than my maximum budget and a decent saving compared to John's offer.

It's time to accept the deal and avoid potentially losing out on the product altogether."
