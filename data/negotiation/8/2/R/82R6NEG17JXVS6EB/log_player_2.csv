Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $11,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about $11,625? That's a small step closer to your goal, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.
