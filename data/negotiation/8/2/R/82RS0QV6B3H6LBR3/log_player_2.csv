"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, there's no benefit to negotiating.  Buying from John immediately guarantees the product at his maximum price.  Any negotiation with Alice risks ending up paying the same price or even more."
