"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is my maximum for this purchase. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum. It's worthwhile for Bob to continue negotiating in hopes of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still higher than his maximum. Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate, and there are still several rounds remaining. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further, so rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation seems like the best option for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I still think the product's value is higher. I'm counteroffering at $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has already offered $12,000. There are still rounds remaining, and there's a possibility that Alice might be willing to come down further to close the deal. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to continue the negotiation and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're very close to a deal! I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I hope you'll accept my offer, so we can finalize this purchase. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're close to a deal, but I still think the product's value is higher. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $13200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still unwilling to budge much, and Bob is only one round away from having to buy from John. Given that Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept Bob's counteroffer in the final round, it's more prudent for Bob to buy from John. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially losing more time and effort in the negotiation."
