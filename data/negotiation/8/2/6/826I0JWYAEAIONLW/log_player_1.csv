Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something that will truly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** The offer is significantly higher than your minimum ($1,000,000) but still provides substantial profit. It suggests value to Bob while conveying a sense of fairness.

This approach aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer if needed."
