"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $14,500, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,500 is a bit low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. Accepting this offer will save him $1,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly lower price."
