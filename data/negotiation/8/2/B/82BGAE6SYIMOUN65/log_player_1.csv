Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential return on investment.  I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to come down a bit more.

Bob is firmly rooted at $850,000 and unlikely to budge. It's not worth further negotiation when I have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000 from John."
