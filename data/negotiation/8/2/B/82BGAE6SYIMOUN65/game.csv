"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. I'm confident that with its unique features, you'll see a substantial return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential return on investment.  I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to come down a bit more.",850000.0,Bob,4,
