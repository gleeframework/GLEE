Alice's offer is way too high.  It's time to counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. I'm confident that with its unique features, you'll see a substantial return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Alice is still asking for too much.  $1,900,000 is more than double what I'm willing to pay.  I'll make another counteroffer."
