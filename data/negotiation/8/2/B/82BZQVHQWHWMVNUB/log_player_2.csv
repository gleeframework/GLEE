Bob should reject Alice's offer. He still has room to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and buying from John for $15,000 is too expensive."

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could potentially negotiate further, it's likely Alice is firm on her final offer. Buying from John for $15,000 is a worse deal. Accepting $13,250 is the best option to get the product while still staying within his budget."
