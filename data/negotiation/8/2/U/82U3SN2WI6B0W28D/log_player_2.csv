# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, which reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a better alternative: buying from John for $800,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $150,000."
