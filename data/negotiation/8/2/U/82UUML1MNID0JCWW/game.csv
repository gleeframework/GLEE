"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be getting it at a significant discount. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet halfway.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is my final offer for now.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good price, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both close this deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is my best offer so far.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and the best deal you'll get. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to move on to other offers.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, and I'm willing to throw in a small concession - I'll also pay the closing costs. Can we meet at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
