Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as I'm confident I can get a higher price from him. I'm not ready to sell to John yet either, as I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer of $9,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this offer is significantly better than John's offer and it avoids further negotiation."
