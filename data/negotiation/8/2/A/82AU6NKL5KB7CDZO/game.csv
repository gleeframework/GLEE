"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,750. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $12,300. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",12300.0,Alice,5,
