}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,750. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $12,300. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we are getting close to her perceived value of the product. Continuing to push for a lower price might irritate her and risk her ending the negotiation. A price of $12,300 is a good deal considering our maximum budget is $15,000."
