"Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you've placed on it, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,200,000. I believe this aligns better with what I am able to invest while still recognizing the product's potential.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This still allows for a reasonable return on your investment, while also fitting comfortably within my financial limits.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it shows my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort you're making to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with a price of $1,400,000. This still represents a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while keeping within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
