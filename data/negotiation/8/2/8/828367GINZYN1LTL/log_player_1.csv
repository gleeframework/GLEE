{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you. My initial offer is $1,750,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and potential benefits. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my starting point."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you've placed on it, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,200,000. I believe this aligns better with what I am able to invest while still recognizing the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This still allows for a reasonable return on your investment, while also fitting comfortably within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer again and try to reach a deal that's closer to my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it shows my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort you're making to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with a price of $1,400,000. This still represents a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while keeping within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,400,000 is tempting, I'm worried that we're getting stuck in a cycle.  I'm not confident that Bob will go any higher, and I've already come down from my initial price significantly.  John is a sure thing for $1,500,000. It's time to move on and secure the sale."
