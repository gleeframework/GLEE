Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to consider selling. I believe the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing that we're not quite on the same page yet. I'm willing to compromise further but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product. Let's split the difference again - I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $950,000, so how about $975,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $975,000 is close to my minimum price, it's still below what I consider the product to be worth.  With John offering me $1,000,000, it's a safer bet for me to sell to him.  I'm not willing to risk going any lower with Bob and potentially losing more money."
