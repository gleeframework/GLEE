"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $1,400,000.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob aims for a significant discount, so he offers a price that's $200,000 less than Alice's offer. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to Alice's desired $1,000,000. 
* **Alternative:**  Bob is aware of the $1,500,000 offer from John, so he's not willing to settle for anything too close to that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $1,300,000 is a good price for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $1,500,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While there's room for further negotiation, it's likely Alice won't drop her price significantly lower.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob keeps rejecting, Alice may decide to sell to someone else.
* **Saving money:** Accepting the offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John."
