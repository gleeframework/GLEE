Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price point to make it work. Would you be willing to consider $1200000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also leaving room for both of us to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
