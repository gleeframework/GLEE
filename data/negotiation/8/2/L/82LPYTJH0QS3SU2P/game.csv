"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I believe holds significant value, for a price of $1500000.  I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price point to make it work. Would you be willing to consider $1200000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also leaving room for both of us to benefit.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider.  This product is truly unique and its value is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly, though. How about $1350000?  This price allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - how about $1275000? This would be a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1275000 is an improvement, it's still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1300000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
