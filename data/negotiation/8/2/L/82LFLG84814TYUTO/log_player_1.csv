"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point you've presented is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. We have plenty of room to negotiate and John provides a strong fallback option."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the initial price, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $2,000,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $2,000,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Could we settle on $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still below our minimum. We'll counteroffer again, but keep John in mind as we progress."

Round 5

Round 6

We are still significantly away from a desirable outcome.  Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts. It is time to increase the pressure and make him aware of the alternative."
