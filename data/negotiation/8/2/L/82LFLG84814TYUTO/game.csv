"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the initial price, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer who values the product at $1,500,000.
