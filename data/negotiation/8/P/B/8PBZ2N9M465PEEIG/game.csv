"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $100, which is the maximum I can afford. If you're willing to accept that, I'd be happy to make the purchase.",100.0,Bob,4,
