"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as the product is worth significantly more to you.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you'd like to proceed.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000, so this is your chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
