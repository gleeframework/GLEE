Alice's offer is way too high.  It's more than my maximum budget, and I can get the product from John for a much better price. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, I'm still comfortable rejecting and counteroffering. I'll aim for a lower price, knowing I can always go to John if needed."
