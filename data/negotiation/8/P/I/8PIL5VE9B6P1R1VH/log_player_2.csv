"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is valuable, $975,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we settle at $900,000?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $900,000.  While we have rounds left to negotiate, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $925,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's starting price and John's offer."
