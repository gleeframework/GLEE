Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,900,000.

Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
