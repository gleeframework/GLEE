"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000, so I'm offering $775,000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $812,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $812,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,
