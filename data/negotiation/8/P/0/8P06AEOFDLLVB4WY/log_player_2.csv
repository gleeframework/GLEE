Bob is offering $1,200,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and still within Bob's budget. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating with Alice, as he still has room to lower the price further."

Bob is offering $1,400,000. This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows Bob is willing to negotiate while staying within his budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his ideal price, it's still a bit high. He should continue negotiating with Alice, as he's only $200,000 away from his goal and might be able to get a better deal."

Bob is offering $1,600,000. This is a bold move, pushing the negotiation further. He's getting closer to his maximum budget, but still leaving room for a possible compromise if Alice is truly interested in selling."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. At this point, Alice's offer is only $150,000 lower than John's price.  The negotiations have gone on for a while, and it's unlikely that Bob will be able to negotiate a significantly lower price with Alice. It's better to secure the product at John's price and avoid further haggling."
