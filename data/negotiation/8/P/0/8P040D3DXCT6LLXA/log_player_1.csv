``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price higher than your minimum value, but still within the potential range of what Bob might be willing to pay.  It also sets a positive tone and leaves room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000. Can you consider $14,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is still a bit below my ideal price, it's above my minimum.  It's also a compromise that shows Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
