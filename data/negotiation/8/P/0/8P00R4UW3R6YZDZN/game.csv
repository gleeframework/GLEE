"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to sell, $9,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I understand that you're motivated to sell, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
