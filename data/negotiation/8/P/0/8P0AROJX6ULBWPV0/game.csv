"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $700,000.  I think that's a fair price given the value we're both seeing in it.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your feedback and understand your desire to get a better price. However, I have to consider the value I've put into the product and the potential it has to generate revenue. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $725,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm now offering the product to you for $760,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",760000.0,Alice,5,
