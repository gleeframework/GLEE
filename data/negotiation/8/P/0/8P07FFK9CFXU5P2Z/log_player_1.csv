Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:**  You need to make at least $150 because you have another buyer lined up (John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product between $120 and $150 leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.  A price of $135 gives Bob a chance to get it for a perceived discount while still netting you a profit. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow room for bargaining.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** Offering it at $135 carries a small risk that Bob will reject it. You could offer it closer to $150 to ensure you get the best price, but that might scare Bob away."
