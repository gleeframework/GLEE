Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**The Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too greedy might make Bob reject the offer.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and Bob's potential gain.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while staying reasonably below Bob's perceived value. This gives you room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Relationship:** Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a good relationship with Bob could be beneficial in the long run. Consider if a slightly lower price is acceptable if it fosters a positive future interaction."
