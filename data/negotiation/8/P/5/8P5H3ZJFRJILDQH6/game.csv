"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a very fair price considering both our positions.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,250. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10500.0,Alice,7,
