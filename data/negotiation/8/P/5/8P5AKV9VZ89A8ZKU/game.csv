"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need something closer to my value.  How about $1050000?  This allows both of us to get a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still feel that $800000 represents a fair value for the product. Let's aim for a compromise at $950000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000. This is my minimum price, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you. Let's close the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
