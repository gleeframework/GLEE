"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum of $100 but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging Bob's potential value of $150. It's also a round number, making it easy to understand and potentially counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $110. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value Bob places on the product and leaves more room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This still leaves a good margin for you and allows me to get closer to the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can agree on this!"", ""product_price"": 120}
