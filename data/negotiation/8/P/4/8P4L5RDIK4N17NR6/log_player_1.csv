Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,200,000) than your minimum.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential profit margin between $800,000 (your minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's valuation). Your goal is to capture as much of this as possible.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to maximize your potential profit but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Aiming slightly below his maximum valuation can be a good strategy.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still securing a substantial profit.
* **Value-Focused:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly reminding Bob why he's interested in the first place.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the offer is firm, the tone suggests you're open to discussing it further, leaving room for Bob to feel involved in the process. 

**Important Note:** Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'd rather walk away and sell to John."
