{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum threshold. It's a good starting point for negotiation.  If Bob rejects it, I'll be ready to counter and potentially even move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum threshold of $150.  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to try one more time to push for a higher price.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go any lower than $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've tried my best to negotiate with Bob, but he's stuck at his price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get more for the product, $150 is still a reasonable profit."
