"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $100 from Alice.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $120 from John is the absolute worst-case scenario, so you have room to bargain with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's lower than Alice's offer, but it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. This gives Alice some incentive to accept, while still allowing for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to her. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer. While $110 is closer to your maximum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a little higher than your previous offer, but still lower than Alice's offer. This shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate but also signals that you're serious about buying the product.  It's a fair compromise that gives Alice some room to agree without losing too much money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $105, which is within your budget and only $5 more than your last counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation will result in a price closer to $100, but it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to buy from John for $120. It's a good compromise, and you can save $15 compared to buying from John."
