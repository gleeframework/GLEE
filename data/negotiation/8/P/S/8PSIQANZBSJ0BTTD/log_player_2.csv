"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $9,500. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($9,500 vs. $8,000).** This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup option with John at $10,000.** This gives you leverage to try and get a better price from Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or wait to see if Alice lowers her offer to get a deal closer to your desired price range."
