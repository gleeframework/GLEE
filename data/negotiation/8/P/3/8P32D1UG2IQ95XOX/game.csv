"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for your product.  This price is still fair considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1350000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1300000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1325000 as a final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I will have to explore other options. Let me know your decision.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1325000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1312500. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1312500.0,Bob,6,
