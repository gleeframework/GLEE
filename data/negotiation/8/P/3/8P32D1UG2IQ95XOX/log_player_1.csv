"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for your product.  This price is still fair considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. I'm confident I can secure a better deal, especially with the option of selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting. I believe I can push for a higher price, and I'm still confident in the possibility of selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000 as a final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I will have to explore other options. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1325000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1312500. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable amount and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's better to secure a sale now than risk further rejection and possibly having to sell to John at a lower price than I would like."
