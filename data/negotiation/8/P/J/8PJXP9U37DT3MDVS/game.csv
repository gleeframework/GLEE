"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500 again? I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
