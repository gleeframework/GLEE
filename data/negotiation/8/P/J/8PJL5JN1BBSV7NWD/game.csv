"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your honesty about your valuation. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you. However, the value of this product is significantly higher for me, and $2,300,000 is a fair reflection of that. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
