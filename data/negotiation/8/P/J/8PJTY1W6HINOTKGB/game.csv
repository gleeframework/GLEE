"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500. This price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  This is a fair price that is in the middle of our two offers, and I think it would be a good deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $10,900.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",10900.0,Alice,5,
