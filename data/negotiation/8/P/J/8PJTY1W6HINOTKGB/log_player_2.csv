# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,500 is too high for Bob.
* **Strategy:**  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500. This price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **Strategy:**  While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will budge. There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  This is a fair price that is in the middle of our two offers, and I think it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $10,900.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $10,900 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than John's price and closer to Bob's ideal price.
* **Strategy:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer.  It's better to accept this offer than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more from John.  There is a high chance Alice will stick to her offer, and continuing the negotiation could lead to a worse outcome for Bob."
