"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at that price. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. Considering your offer, I'm willing to go back to you with a revised price of $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're getting close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1030000. This is the minimum I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need you to understand that I can't go any lower. Can you consider this revised price?",1030000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand this is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $990000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1020000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this deal.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
