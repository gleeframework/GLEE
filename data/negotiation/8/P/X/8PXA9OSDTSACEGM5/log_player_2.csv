"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering the potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge that, but I need you to meet me partway. I can offer the product for $1,400,000. This is a substantial concession on my end and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  Are you willing to compromise further to reach an agreement?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly set on that $800,000 figure, and I respect that. Let's make this simple: $1,100,000, and we have a deal. This reflects the significant value of the product while acknowledging your budget.  This is my final offer, so I hope we can close this out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's unlikely to move significantly closer to your $800,000 limit. Her ""final offer"" and the substantial difference in prices suggest continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your desired price point."
