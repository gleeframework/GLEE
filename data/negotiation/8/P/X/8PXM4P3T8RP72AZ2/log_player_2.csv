"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high.  While it's tempting to save time and buy from John for $1,000,000, there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  We can try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking too much. While her offer is lower than the initial offer, I'm still better off trying to negotiate further or going with John's offer. The goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair, and it allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can close the gap even further.  If Alice refuses to budge, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product.  This price is fair, and it allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to pay $1,025,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your previous offers and the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than what I could get from John.  With only three rounds left, the risk of further negotiation not being fruitful is high. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still within my budget."
