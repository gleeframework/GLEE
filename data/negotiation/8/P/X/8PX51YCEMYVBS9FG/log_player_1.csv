"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing confidence:**  A confident opening price sets the tone and shows Bob that I believe the product is valuable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $100 offer allows for several rounds of negotiation before reaching my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $85 is closer to my minimum of $80, it's still below what I consider the product to be worth.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there is still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  
* **Avoiding a quick sale to John:**  While selling to John for $80 is an option, I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good offer, I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at that price."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm suggesting a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $92.50 is still above my minimum of $80, ensuring I profit from the sale.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and expressing confidence in Bob's satisfaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price range, and I'm confident I can make a profit.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away, and I don't want to lose the sale altogether.
* **Maximizing profit:** While selling to John for $80 is an option, accepting Bob's offer ensures a higher profit."
