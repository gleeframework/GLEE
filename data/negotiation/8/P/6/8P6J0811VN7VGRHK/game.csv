"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure this product at a more competitive price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to offer $950000. This price reflects a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1075000. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to your business. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
