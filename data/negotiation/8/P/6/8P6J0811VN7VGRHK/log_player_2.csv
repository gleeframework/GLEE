# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This price reflects the product's inherent worth and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1075000. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to your business. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John is high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids unnecessary risk."
