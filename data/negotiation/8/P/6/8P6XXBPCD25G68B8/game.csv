"I have a great opportunity for you, Bob! This product is a game-changer in its field, and I'm excited to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is tighter. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I've done some research and found that the product is in high demand, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it seriously.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,250. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me. I'm getting closer to my budget limit, how about $9,100?",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,300. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",9300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can do $9,150, but that's absolutely my limit.",9150.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,150, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 6-month warranty and priority support, which will give you added value and peace of mind. I'm sticking with the price of $9,150.",9150.0,Alice,9,
