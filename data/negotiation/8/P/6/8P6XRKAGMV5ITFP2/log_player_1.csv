I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, or if he'll come in with a lower counteroffer."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal, and he'll come closer to my price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price. It's still below my initial goal, but it's only $50,000 less than my last counteroffer.  It's time to accept and avoid risking further negotiation."
