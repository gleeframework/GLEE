``` 

This offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a strong starting point, demonstrating your confidence in the product's value. 

This approach balances the need to get a good price while keeping the negotiation open and allowing room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth.  I believe I can do better."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal, potentially by pushing further with Bob or by selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is still not a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's try to bridge the gap.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

While $980,000 is a decent offer, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for my desired price, so I'll go ahead and sell it to him."
