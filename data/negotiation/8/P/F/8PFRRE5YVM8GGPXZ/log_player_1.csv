"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to consider my offer, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $95. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This would give you a good deal, and ensure I can still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to close the deal, Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm getting closer to my desired price, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $100 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that benefits us both.  How about $108? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. I'm comfortable with $105 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer more, I'm aware that we're nearing the end of the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the sale.  I'm going to accept his offer to secure a sale and avoid selling to John for $120."
