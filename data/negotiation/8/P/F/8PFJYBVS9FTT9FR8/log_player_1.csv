Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial price provides a cushion for potential counteroffers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** A collaborative and positive message helps establish a good foundation for the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have a strong alternative in John, so it's worth negotiating further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.  This product is truly exceptional and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  By stating your minimum acceptable price, you establish a firm boundary while still signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value helps justify the price and potentially sway Bob's perception.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer represents a significant concession from your initial price while still aiming for a price above Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident the product will be worth the investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $900,000 is a significant improvement and represents a reasonable compromise. While it's less than your ideal price and less than John's offer, consider these points:

* **Profitable:**  $900,000 is still a substantial profit margin. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation time and the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Prolonged negotiations can be tiring and potentially damage the relationship.

Accepting Bob's offer at $900,000 is a pragmatic choice that secures a good return."
