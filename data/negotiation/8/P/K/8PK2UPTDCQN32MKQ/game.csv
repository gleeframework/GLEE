"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,250,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,300,000?  This would still leave you a good deal of value while allowing me to make a fair profit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more around $1,275,000.  Would that work for you?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position and I'm happy to keep working with you.  $1,275,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,287,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
