Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a price that's still very beneficial for me.
* **Alternative Option:** I have a fallback option with John ($8,000), so I'm not desperate. This allows me to confidently aim high with Bob."
