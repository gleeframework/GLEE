"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $10,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
