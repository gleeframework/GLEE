"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $1500000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
