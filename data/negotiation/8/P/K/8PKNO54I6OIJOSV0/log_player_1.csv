Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a reasoned offer to Bob, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible. Offering it at John's price guarantees the sale but leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $1,200,000 sets a lower bound. Going below this is pointless.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $1,350,000 offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer.  It signals willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't *just* state a price. It emphasizes ""unique value"" to make the price seem more justified, even if Bob doesn't fully agree.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, a lower price might be more appealing to avoid delays with John.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, starting even higher might be a tactic."
