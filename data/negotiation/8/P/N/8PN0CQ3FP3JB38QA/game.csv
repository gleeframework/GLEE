"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split, but I was thinking more along the lines of $142.50. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that works for you.",142.5,Alice,5,
