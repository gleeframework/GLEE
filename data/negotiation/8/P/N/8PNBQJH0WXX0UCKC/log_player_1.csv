Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $16,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  A higher offer will help you gauge Bob's interest level. If he's willing to negotiate, you know he's serious. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it emphasizes the product's ""significant value"" and positions it as an ""investment."" This might encourage Bob to reconsider his initial valuation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize profit, so try to find a price point agreeable to both of you. Remember, you always have John as a guaranteed sale at $12,000."
