Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $90.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $90, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard limit, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is still below my minimum price of $100.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer.
* **John as backup:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is a little lower than what I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go to $88?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:** $88 is a compromise that's closer to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm staying friendly and emphasizing compromise to keep Bob engaged.
* **Keep John as a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $100 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still looking to save a bit more.  How about $86?  That's a good middle ground and would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $86 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $100.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  I've already made a counteroffer, and Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to his perceived value rather than mine.
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is willing to pay $100, which is a significantly better deal for me than accepting Bob's offer. 

It's more profitable and less time-consuming to sell to John."
