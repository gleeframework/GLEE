"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly lower than John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better deal before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Could you do it for $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming low to see how much Alice is willing to budge. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The tone is friendly and suggests I'm genuinely interested but need a more attractive price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will give me a better sense of how much lower Alice might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved from $120 to $105, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, $105 is still significantly higher than my target price. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming slightly below the midpoint between our last offers to incentivize her to settle closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about $98?  That's a pretty good price, and I'm ready to buy right away if you're okay with it."",
 ""product_price"": 98
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm aiming slightly below the midpoint between $90 and $105 to nudge Alice closer to my desired range. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I added ""ready to buy right away"" to subtly signal I might be considering other options if we can't agree soon.  
* **Firm but Fair:** The tone remains respectful while showing I'm serious about getting a good deal."
