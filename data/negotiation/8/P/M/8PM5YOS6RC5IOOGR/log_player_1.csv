Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$200:** This is a starting point that is higher than your minimum value but allows room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  A friendly and engaging message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.  Mentioning the product's value to him can pique his interest. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! You've made a successful sale.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You'll have to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth accepting or making a counteroffer.
* **Stalemate:**  If you feel the negotiation isn't going anywhere, you can always choose to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the [product name]. I'm interested, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum value, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit higher.  Since your goal is to maximize your profit, it makes sense to try and get closer to your desired $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $185. That's still a great deal for this [product name] and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 185}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowered Price:**  I've lowered the price slightly to show flexibility while still aiming for a better price than Bob's offer.
* **Positive Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Negotiation Space:**  A price of $185 leaves room for a potential compromise if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, could we possibly agree on $170 for the [product name]? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $170 is just below your minimum price of $150. However, it's very close, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale entirely.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John for $150, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice to maximize your earnings in this scenario."
