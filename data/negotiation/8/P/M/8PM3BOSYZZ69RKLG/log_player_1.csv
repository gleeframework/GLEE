Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum value, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially trigger a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than half of my minimum value. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it demonstrates flexibility in the negotiation. I hope this counteroffer will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value and far below what I'm hoping to achieve. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $900,000. This is still a substantial profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise that might finally convince Bob to come to terms."
