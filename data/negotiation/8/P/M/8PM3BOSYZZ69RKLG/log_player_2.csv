Alice's offer is far too high.  It's time to counteroffer and see if we can get a better price."

I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. Let's see what Alice thinks."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to pay more than my initial counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's try to negotiate further."

This counteroffer is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  However, it's still lower than Alice's current price and leaves some room for negotiation before I reach my maximum.  Let's see if this time Alice is willing to meet in the middle."

Alice is still too high, and while I could counteroffer again, I'm not sure we'll reach an agreement. To be safe and avoid any further risk of spending more than my budget, I'll buy the product from John."
