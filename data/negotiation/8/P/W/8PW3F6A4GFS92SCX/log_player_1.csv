Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:** I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still being open to a deal. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer and potentially push the price higher. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  It's possible that I can negotiate a price closer to my desired range with Bob or, if he continues to refuse, I can sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000. 

**Next Step:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, attempting to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000,  which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer, showing flexibility but also demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  $11,000 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This increases the chances of reaching a deal.
* **Maintaining Profit:** While $11,000 is lower than my ideal, it still allows me to achieve a substantial profit.

This approach aims to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while maximizing my potential earnings. If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll have to weigh the risks of continuing the negotiation against the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $10,500 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower final price, especially considering his persistent desire for a lower price. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a significantly higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Final Decision:**  Given the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and the guaranteed profit from selling to John, it's best to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
