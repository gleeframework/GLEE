Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

Bob's offer is too low. I will counter with a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

While $130 is closer, it's still below my minimum. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $140, but that's my absolute final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
