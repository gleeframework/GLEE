"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value.  I'll see how Bob reacts before adjusting my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to make a deal,  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm countering with $180. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable price, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still a bit low. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm countering with $160. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but also that I'm not willing to go too far below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is now my minimum acceptable value.  Since I have the option to sell to John for the same price, there's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
