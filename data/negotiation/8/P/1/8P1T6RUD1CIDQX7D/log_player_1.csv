Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only willing to pay up to $1,250,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,600,000 for this product. Let's try to bridge the gap.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I am still not able to go above $1,250,000. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer hasn't changed. We've gone through several rounds and he's unwilling to budge. This deal isn't going to work out, so I'm going to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
