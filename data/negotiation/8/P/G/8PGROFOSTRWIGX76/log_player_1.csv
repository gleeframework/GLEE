Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. $130 is still below my minimum, and I have a few more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great deal for a product you value at $150, and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $132 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a bit more. I've already conceded a bit and have a few more rounds to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
