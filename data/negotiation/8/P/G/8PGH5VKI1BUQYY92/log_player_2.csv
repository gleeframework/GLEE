"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can lower the price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial asking price of $100 to $90, which is a good compromise. Since I'm comfortable spending up to $150, accepting this offer is a good deal and saves me money compared to buying from John."
