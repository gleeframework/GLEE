"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still a significant amount above the product's value to him ($8,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000), but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and Bob is trying to find a price that's fair to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a lower price than Alice's first offer, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $12,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. There are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise.  He's still below Alice's latest offer, but it's a good middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a lower price than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $12,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can potentially save a significant amount of money by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below his maximum value. This is a good strategy to try and find a meeting point with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $12,000. However, with only three rounds remaining, the risk of not finding a better deal with Alice is increasing. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer to $10,000, which is closer to Alice's latest offer and still within his budget. With only two rounds left, Bob needs to make a substantial move to show his serious interest in buying. This counteroffer reflects a willingness to compromise and potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, Alice's offer of $11,050 is still above Bob's maximum value of $12,000. It's highly unlikely that Alice will significantly lower her price in the final round. To avoid the risk of not securing the product, and to stay within his budget, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000."
