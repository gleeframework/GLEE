"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is of great value to you.  I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial.  My asking price is $1,150,000. This represents a significant value to you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to her ($1,150,000 vs. $1,000,000). There's a good chance we can get a better price by rejecting this offer and seeing if she'll come down.  While John offers it at $1,200,000, there's no harm in seeing if Alice will drop her price closer to its value to her."
