"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product to you. Let's find a compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,250,000. How about $1,200,000? That's the price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
