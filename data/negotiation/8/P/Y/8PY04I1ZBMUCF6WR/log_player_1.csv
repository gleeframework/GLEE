Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in.  I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and open to discussion.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, allowing the negotiation to begin. 
* **Leaving the door open for John:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $120, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a compromise by splitting the difference, making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, encouraging further dialogue. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm still keeping the possibility of selling to John open if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $110 was a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Can you do $112? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $112 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum.  I've already made a concession by lowering my price to $115, and Bob's offer shows that he's not willing to budge much.

Rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially get stuck with a lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $120. This guarantees me my minimum price and ensures I don't lose out on a profitable deal."
