"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm only interested in paying a price that's fair to both of us.  Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and the value it can bring.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,900,000 is still too much for me.  I understand you want a fair price, and I'm trying to be fair as well.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. I've tried to be flexible, but the $1,100,000 offer is still too low for me to accept. This product has significant value that goes beyond its price tag.  To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for it.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach a deal on this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
