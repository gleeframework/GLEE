# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While $95 is within your budget, you can get the product for a better price from John ($100). By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with your backup option of buying from John."
