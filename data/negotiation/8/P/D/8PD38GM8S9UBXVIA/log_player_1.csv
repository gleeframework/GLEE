Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and leaves room for us both to walk away with a win. What do you think?
