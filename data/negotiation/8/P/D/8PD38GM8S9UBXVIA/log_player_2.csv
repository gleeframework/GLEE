# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price. There's room for negotiation, and you can likely secure a better deal. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above my ideal price.  I want to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,150,000 is still above my ideal price. I've already counter-offered twice, and she's made it clear she's not willing to go lower. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,000,000. This ensures I get the product at the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
