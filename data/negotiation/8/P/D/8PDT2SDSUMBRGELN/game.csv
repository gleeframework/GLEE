"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12000.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  $14000 is closer, but I'm only willing to go up to $13000. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to go with John's offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $13500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,7,
