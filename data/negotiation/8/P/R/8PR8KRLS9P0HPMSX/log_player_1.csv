{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $88? That would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  I understand you're looking for a good price, but $82 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 6

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $81
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he'll walk away.  I'd rather secure the sale now, even for a slightly lower price, than risk losing the deal altogether."
