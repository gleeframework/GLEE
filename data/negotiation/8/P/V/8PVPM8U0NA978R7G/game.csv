"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't fully reflect the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a good compromise considering the value to both of us. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
