"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
