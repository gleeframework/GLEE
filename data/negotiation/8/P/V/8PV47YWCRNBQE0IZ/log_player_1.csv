Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him a potential incentive to accept.  However, it's also well below my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate if he rejects.  I'm also leaving the door open to a potential sale with John if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I can still sell to John for $12,000, so I have some leverage in these negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
