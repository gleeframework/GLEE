"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to own a valuable item, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Since John is selling the product for $800,000, Bob should buy it from John."
