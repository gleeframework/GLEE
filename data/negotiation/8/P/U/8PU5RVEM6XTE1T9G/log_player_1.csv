Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable price. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  It highlights the value of the product and tries to establish a positive tone for the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get Bob to think seriously about the offer.** 
* **Leave room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing your minimum desired profit.**
* **Show that you are willing to be flexible but are also serious about getting a good price.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell for such a low price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price and a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate for a sale. 
* **Message highlights the compromise:** This emphasizes the value I'm offering while also being firm in my position. 
* **Open-ended question encourages response:** This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
