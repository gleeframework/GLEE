"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a significant profit.  I'll keep an eye on how Bob reacts to see if I can push for an even higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to my initial offer of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

I'm counteroffering with $925,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also  that I'm confident in the value of the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal range. I'll keep negotiating and see if I can push him a little higher. There are still several rounds left, and selling to John would be a last resort if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. We're only halfway through the negotiation process, and I'm confident I can get a higher price if I continue to counteroffer strategically."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept because it's close to John's offer, I'm not ready to give up yet. We only have two rounds left, and there's a good chance Bob will come closer to my price range if I hold firm."

```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is a final attempt to close the deal with Bob.  It's a significant compromise on my part, but it still allows me to earn a profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid losing the sale entirely."

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but with only one round left, it's time to cut my losses. Bob is unwilling to budge further, and I've already compromised considerably.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $800,000 is better than risking no sale at all."
