"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to pay a premium for something unique, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $7500 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8100.

"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to sell the product for $7800. I think we've reached a stalemate. I'm going to have to consider other options. If you're still interested, I can sell it to John for $8000. It's up to you to decide what you want to do.",8000.0,Alice,7,
