Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'm hoping this initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and potentially lead to a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like to get. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counter-offering at $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd prefer to get $140, it's unlikely he'll budge further, and selling to John for $100 is less attractive. Accepting Bob's offer at $135 ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
