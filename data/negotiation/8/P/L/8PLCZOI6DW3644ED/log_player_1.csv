Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially going even higher than $1,400,000.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have John as a backup who will buy it for $1,000,000. This approach guarantees a substantial profit either way."
