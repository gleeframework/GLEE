# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for you. Given its significance to you, I understand its worth is estimated at $1,000,000. After careful consideration, I propose to offer you this exceptional item at a special price of $950,000. This represents a significant saving for you while still allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's true worth and the resources invested in it. I believe this offer presents a favorable deal for both parties and looks forward to discussing this further with you.
