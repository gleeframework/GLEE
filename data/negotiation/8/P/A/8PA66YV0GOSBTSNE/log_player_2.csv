"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  It's unlikely Alice will accept a deal at $600,000 when it's worth $800,000 to her, but it's worth seeing how the negotiation unfolds.  Rejecting the offer will allow us to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

This counteroffer is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still shows you're serious about buying the product. This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your price, but it's still above your target. We can try to get her even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
``` 
This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows you're willing to compromise while also pushing for a price closer to your goal."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering a price that is very close to our desired price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting the offer ensures we get the product while saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
