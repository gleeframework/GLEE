"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $105. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95. I can offer it to you for $100. This is the last time I'll be willing to negotiate, and I think it's a fair price.",100.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $98?",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you halfway and offered the product for $100, and now you're asking me to go even lower. I'm not willing to go below $100, so I'm going to have to make a tough decision. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $100. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I think I'll have to look elsewhere for the product. I appreciate your time and effort in negotiating with me, and I wish you the best in finding a buyer.",80.0,Bob,10,
