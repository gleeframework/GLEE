"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know the value it brings is well above that. Let's start our negotiation here, and see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This allows for some savings on your end, while still being a fair price for me. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, $1,080,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. That's a significant concession on my part, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can close this deal, I'm ready to move forward.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
