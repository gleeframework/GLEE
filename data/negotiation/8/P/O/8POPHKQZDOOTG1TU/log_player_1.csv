Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know the value it brings is well above that. Let's start our negotiation here, and see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).  However, I believe I can get a better price. I have 9 rounds left and am confident I can negotiate a more advantageous deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This allows for some savings on your end, while still being a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still have time to negotiate further. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me leverage to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, $1,080,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. That's a significant concession on my part, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can close this deal, I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1110000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,110,000, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm concerned that we're getting bogged down in a stalemate. There are only 4 rounds left, and I'm unsure if I can secure a significantly higher price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a sale, and with 4 rounds remaining, I don't have enough time to risk pushing for a better price from Bob."
