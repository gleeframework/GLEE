Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for profit above John's offer. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer,  Alice aims to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price."
