"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I know it's worth even more. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $10,000 and Alice's offer is exactly $10,000, there's no potential to save money by accepting her offer.  Therefore, it's better for Bob to go with John, who is also selling the product for $10,000."
