"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  $900,000 is still a significant amount over what the product is worth to Alice. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by significantly lowering the price.  It's a bold move, but it's likely Alice won't accept it immediately. The goal is to get Alice to come down from her initial price and start a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Alice has already moved down from her initial price, so there's a good chance she'll continue to come down with another counteroffer.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, showing you're willing to meet Alice halfway, but still lower than her latest offer.  It's a reasonable step towards a deal, and hopefully, Alice will see that and be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially ending up buying from John for a higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal while leaving room for potential future profits if the product's value increases beyond your current estimate."
