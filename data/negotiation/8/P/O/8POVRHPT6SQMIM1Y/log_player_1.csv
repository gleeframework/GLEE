"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $11,000}

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than what the product is worth to me, but still above what it's worth to Bob. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500, as it's still below what it's worth to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $10,800}

I'm increasing the price slightly from my initial offer, trying to get closer to the value the product has to me. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
