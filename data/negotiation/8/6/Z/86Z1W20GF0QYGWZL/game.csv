"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is a good starting point, it's a bit below what I believe this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, but I'm confident this product will generate much more value for you in the long run.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product has a lot of value, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to take on the risk of the product not meeting my expectations.",950000.0,Bob,4,
