Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.
