Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be acceptable.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $8,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to sell at a loss. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
