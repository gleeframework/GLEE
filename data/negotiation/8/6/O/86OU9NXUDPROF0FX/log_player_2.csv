"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can potentially get the product for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still higher than John's price, but it's getting closer to your budget. It's worth accepting this offer as it saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.  You're also likely to get the product faster by accepting the offer, rather than continuing to negotiate."
