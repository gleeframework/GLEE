"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000, as that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can offer $9,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is the absolute highest I can go. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. $11,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can go as high as $10,000, which is a significant compromise for me. I'm hopeful we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,7,
