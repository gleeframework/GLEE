Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is possible range from $1,200,001 to $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below Bob's maximum value. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's worth.
2. **Justification:** Provide a brief, plausible reason for the price (e.g., market value, unique features).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and market demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal given its potential return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The $1,450,000 starting point is below Bob's maximum but leaves you significant profit potential. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language implies you're open to discussion, allowing Bob to feel involved and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or risk losing the deal."
