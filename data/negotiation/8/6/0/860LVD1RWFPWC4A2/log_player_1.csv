"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $160. That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 160} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be a more acceptable offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think $160 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $140 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm proposing $150, which is exactly my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm willing to be flexible, while also ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is too low for me, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to sell to John for $150 and ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."
