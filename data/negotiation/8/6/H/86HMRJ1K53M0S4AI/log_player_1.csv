{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal and I believe you'll find it to be of great value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle on a price higher than your minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A price slightly below a common round number like $15,000 can sometimes feel more appealing to buyers. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and any further information you gather during your interaction."
