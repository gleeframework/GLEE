Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,250. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.

While I could push for more, getting $8,250 from Bob is still a decent profit over my minimum ($8,000). It's better to secure a deal now than risk him walking away in future rounds."
