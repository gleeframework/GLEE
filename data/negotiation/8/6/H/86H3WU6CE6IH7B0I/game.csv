"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1200000.  This price is fair and reflects the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum price point for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1300000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to acquire the product at a value I'm comfortable with.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
