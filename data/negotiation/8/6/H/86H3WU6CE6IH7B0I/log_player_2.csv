"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product for $1400000. It's a significant value proposition, and I believe it aligns well with your needs. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You're still getting a good deal at $1,400,000, but there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup option with John.**  This gives you leverage to try and get a better price from Alice.

**Next steps:**  You should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to $1,000,000 (her minimum acceptable price), but leave some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This price is fair and reflects the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a bold move to show you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Value-based:**  The message highlights the product's value to you, justifying your offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  Emphasizing a mutually beneficial agreement can create a more collaborative negotiation tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum price point for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your price.**  She's dropped from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, which is a positive sign.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is now at $1,300,000.  There's a $100,000 gap that can potentially be bridged. 
* **The backup option with John provides leverage.**  You don't need to settle immediately.

**Next steps:**  You should counteroffer again, ideally closer to $1,250,000. This demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to acquire the product at a value I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.

* **Focus on Value:**  The message reaffirms that you're trying to acquire the product at a good value for yourself, without being overly aggressive."
