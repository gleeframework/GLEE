Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be highly beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we want to start by aiming higher than both. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message includes a brief justification for the price, emphasizing the product's value. While this might not directly convince Bob, it frames the offer in a positive light. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering it at $19,000, we have room to potentially come down in price if Bob negotiates, but still secure a profit above our minimum and Bob's perceived value.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have limited information about Bob's negotiation tactics and willingness to pay.  If we had more information, we could potentially tailor our approach for a more optimal outcome."
