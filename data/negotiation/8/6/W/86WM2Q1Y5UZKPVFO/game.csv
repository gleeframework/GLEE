"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $14000 to make this worth my while. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $13000. That's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm afraid $13000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $13500 to make this deal worthwhile. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Alice,5,
