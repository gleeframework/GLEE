Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While you want to maximize your profit, setting the price too close to $150 might make Bob immediately reject the offer.  $140 is a significant markup from his perceived value but might still be tempting.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John buying the product for $150. This knowledge allows you to be firm with Bob and not settle for less than your desired profit."
