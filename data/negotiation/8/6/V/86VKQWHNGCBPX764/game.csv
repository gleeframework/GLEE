"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
