"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it valuable and worth the investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. There are 9 more rounds, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but there is still room for negotiation. It's worth pushing for a lower price, as Bob still has 7 more rounds to potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm still open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now just $80,000 above Bob's maximum price.  However, Bob only has 5 rounds left.  With the risk of Alice potentially raising the price again, it's more prudent for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum price point.  It's a guarantee and avoids further negotiation risk."
