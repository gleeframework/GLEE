"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation.  Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price in subsequent rounds.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down a bit, especially since she wants to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget and above her minimum value.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further compromise. It's a good starting point for finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still higher than what I believe is a fair price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to continue to see if I can get her to drop the price further. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise considering our positions, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. This counteroffer is still within my budget and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate while showing a genuine desire to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and her current offer is close to my target price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or having the negotiation stall for too long outweighs the potential savings of a few thousand dollars. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids any further complications."
