"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can gauge his interest and adjust our counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I believe we can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000.  This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to close the deal at a price closer to my ideal while still appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $920,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  $920,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000."
