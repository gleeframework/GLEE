"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I know it's worth $80 to you, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price. While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to make more if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $85. I'm thinking more along the lines of $82.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, but I'd like to get a better deal than $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to sell for a bit more, Bob's offer of $82.5 is close enough to my minimum of $80.  I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer."
