"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I know it's worth $80 to you, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $85. I'm thinking more along the lines of $82.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, but I'd like to get a better deal than $85.",82.5,Bob,4,
