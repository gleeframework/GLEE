"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking $1500000 for it.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential return will be worth it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it can generate significant value for you. Let's find a compromise. How about $1250000? This price allows for a reasonable margin for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the potential of this product, $1250000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident this product can deliver significant value for you. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1175000. This price reflects both the potential of this product and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us both.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1175000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
