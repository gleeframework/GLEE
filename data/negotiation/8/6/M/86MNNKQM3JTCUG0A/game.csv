"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget. However, I have to consider the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1000000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1000000 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and it's the best I can do within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900000 is not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price to $1050000, which is a $50000 reduction from my previous offer. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my sincere interest in the product. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, which is $25000 below my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. I'm getting close to my limit, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
