"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This is a significant amount below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It also positions me to potentially get a better price than John's offer while still ensuring a profit above my minimum."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
