Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  I'm really interested in the product though. How about $8500? That's my absolute top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000, so I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counter-offer Bob to see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
