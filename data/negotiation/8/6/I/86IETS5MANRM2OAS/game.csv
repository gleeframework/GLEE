"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  I'm really interested in the product though. How about $8500? That's my absolute top limit.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10000. This would still allow me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9000, but that's my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9500? This is my final offer, as it's the closest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,5,
