"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at $10,000, but knowing your expertise in this field, I'm confident it would be worth even more to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a significant discount, as I'm sure you'll appreciate the value it holds.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",11000.0,Alice,1,
