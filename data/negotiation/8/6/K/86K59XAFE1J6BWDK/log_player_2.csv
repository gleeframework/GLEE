**Reasoning:**

Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly from her price. At this point, her offers are getting closer to John's price of $12,000.  Rather than risk the negotiation dragging on and potentially ending up with a price closer to or even at $12,000, it's more strategic to cut your losses and buy from John. This ensures you get the product at a price you know is reasonable within your budget."
