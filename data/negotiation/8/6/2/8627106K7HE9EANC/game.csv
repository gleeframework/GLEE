"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $110, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $115. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
