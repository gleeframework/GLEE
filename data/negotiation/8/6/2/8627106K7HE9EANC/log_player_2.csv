Alice's offer is too high. The product is only worth $120 to you, and you can always buy it from John at that price. You should try to negotiate a better deal with Alice."

Alice is coming down, but the price is still higher than what you can get from John. There's room to negotiate further."

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and you're now at a point where you'd lose money compared to buying from John. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
