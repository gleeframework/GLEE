"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $140 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $130. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $150, and Alice is now offering it for $135.
* **Savings:** This is a significant saving compared to buying from John for $150. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the risk is that Alice might reject and the price could go back up. At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure a good deal."
