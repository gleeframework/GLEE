"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's better to negotiate and see if you can get a price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to John's price, it's still worth negotiating further. I'll try to get Alice closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target. It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'll offer it to you for $8,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $8,500 is a reasonable price compared to John's $8,000 offer. It's best to accept now and avoid the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
