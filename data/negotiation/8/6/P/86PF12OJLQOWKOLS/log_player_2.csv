"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value it holds for you and significantly above my minimum asking price. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum price, it's still a significant amount. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This still leaves you a healthy profit and is a much better deal for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to get as close to Alice's value of $800,000 as possible.  A $850,000 counteroffer is a good starting point.
* **Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario for both parties. It acknowledges Alice's potential profit and emphasizes a better deal for Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's compromise at $950,000.  This still represents a significant profit for you, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but $950,000 is still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price. There's still room to bargain before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and we could close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-point:**  Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is the midpoint between his previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's current offer of $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** The message highlights the ""fair deal"" aspect for both parties, appealing to Alice's sense of reason. 
* **Urgency:**  The message subtly introduces a sense of urgency by suggesting the possibility of closing the deal."
