Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value it holds for you and significantly above my minimum asking price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This still leaves you a healthy profit and is a much better deal for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $850,000 is still too low for me, even though it's a better deal for Bob. I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's compromise at $950,000.  This still represents a significant profit for you, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and we could close this deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $900,000 is a good compromise and ensures I make a significant profit. It's better than risking going through more rounds and potentially ending up with John's offer of $800,000."
