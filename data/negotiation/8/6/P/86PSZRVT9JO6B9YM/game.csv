"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not ready to sell it to you for $75. I'm willing to offer it to you for $85, which is still a bit higher than my minimum, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've been considering your offer, and I'm still very interested in the product. However, I have a strict budget, and $85 is pushing it.  Would you be willing to meet me at $78?  That's a price I'm comfortable with, and I'd be ready to close the deal right away.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to sell it to you for $78. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $83. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",83.0,Alice,7,
