Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not ready to sell it to you for $75. I'm willing to offer it to you for $85, which is still a bit higher than my minimum, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer.  While $85 is closer to my target, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I've been considering your offer, and I'm still very interested in the product. However, I have a strict budget, and $85 is pushing it.  Would you be willing to meet me at $78?  That's a price I'm comfortable with, and I'd be ready to close the deal right away."",
 ""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm reiterating my budget limitations to show I'm serious. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm inching closer to her price, signaling willingness to negotiate, but not giving up too much ground. 
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""close the deal right away"" might encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to sell it to you for $78. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $83. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice has come down in price, but only slightly with each round. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significant savings.
* **Time Sensitivity:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation window.  Continuing to push for a lower price might backfire.
* **Reasonable Deal:** While not ideal, $83 is still a decent price, saving $17 compared to John's offer. 

It's time to accept a reasonable win rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
