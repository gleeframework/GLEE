"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This price reflects its worth and allows for a healthy margin for both of us. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both parties.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value while offering you a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 still leaves me too far from my desired price.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal, as I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
