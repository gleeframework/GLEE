Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more aggressive offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, his aggressive haggling and threat to walk away suggest he might not be willing to meet the minimum price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of continued negotiation with Bob, which might not result in a better offer."
