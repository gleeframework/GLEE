"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $160 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $130?  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tight.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $145 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your final offer of $135. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $140. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
