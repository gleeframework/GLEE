"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $18,000 is above your budget."

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and signals I'm willing to walk away if necessary.  We'll see if she counters or accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $16,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to take the risk of another counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, and I'm confident I can get it for a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 15500} 
``` 

This time, I'm raising my offer slightly, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but still emphasizing that I won't go over my maximum budget. This should hopefully encourage Alice to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice has rejected my last two offers, and I'm starting to feel like she's not going to budge much further.  While $16,000 isn't a terrible price, I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation and possibly get stuck with an even higher price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John, who's offering the product at my maximum budget."
