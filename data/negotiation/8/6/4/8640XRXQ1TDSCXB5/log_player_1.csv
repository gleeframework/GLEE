"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's not, we can negotiate down from there. 

I'm also keeping in mind the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me some leverage in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,750,000. This is still a significant amount above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob, and I'm confident that I can reach a better deal with him.  I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a lower price than my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's closer to what Bob is willing to pay.  I'm still aiming to earn as much as possible, but I'm also considering the possibility that Bob may not be willing to pay significantly more than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is very tempting, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer with Bob.  I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob, and I'm confident that I can reach a better deal with him.  I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm dropping the price again to $1,400,000. This is my final attempt to get Bob to agree. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, it's better to accept the sure thing from John rather than risk getting nothing at all from Bob in the remaining rounds."
