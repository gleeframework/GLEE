"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This is a good compromise that I think we can both agree on.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go lower than $1,500,000. This is my bottom line, and it's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  I know it's a great deal for you, and I believe the product will be very valuable to you. Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
