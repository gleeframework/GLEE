"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This is a good compromise that I think we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go lower than $1,500,000. This is my bottom line, and it's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had a few rounds of negotiations with Bob, but we haven't been able to reach an agreement.  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,500,000, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to go higher. To avoid further haggling and ensure I get my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
