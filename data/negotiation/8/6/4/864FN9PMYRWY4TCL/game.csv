"Alice, your offer is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I've invested significant time and resources into this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 right now. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for a quick sale.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,025,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can close the deal a little lower.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price considering both our positions. Let's see if we can finalize this.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and meet you at $1,000,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
