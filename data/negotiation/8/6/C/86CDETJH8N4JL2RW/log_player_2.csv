# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still secure the product from John, albeit at a slightly higher price."
