"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $22,000. Considering its worth to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $18,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",18500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial ask. Would you consider $20,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial ask, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'm proposing a counteroffer of $19,000.
