``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of a possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, so I'll offer $10250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price of $15,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,750. This price is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10750, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $10375. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This negotiation has gone on long enough, and Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John and get my desired price."
