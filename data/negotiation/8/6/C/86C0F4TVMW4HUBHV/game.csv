"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can see you're willing to meet me at $750,000, but I'm not quite there yet. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $760,000? That's the lowest I can go.",760000.0,Alice,5,
