"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I know this product is valuable to you, and I want to give you a fair chance to acquire it. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
