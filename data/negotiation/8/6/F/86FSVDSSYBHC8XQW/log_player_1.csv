Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You need to find a price that's higher than your minimum but also attractive enough for Bob to choose your offer over losing the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I know this product is valuable to you, and I want to give you a fair chance to acquire it. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offered price is just below Bob's maximum valuation, creating a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message implies scarcity and competition, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **""Fair"" Negotiation:** While the price is heavily weighted in your favor, framing it as a ""fair chance"" might make Bob more receptive.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your guaranteed price from John. If he knew, he'd have no reason to offer more than a price very close to $1,500,000."
