Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit. I'm confident that he'll be willing to negotiate, and I can always fall back on John's offer if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd rather sell than not, I'm not willing to go that low, especially since I know John will pay $80. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  It's a fair offer that hopefully will make Bob want to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, but I'm not interested in spending more time negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer from John.  I'll take John's offer and avoid any further negotiation."
