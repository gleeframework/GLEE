"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high baseline and see how Bob reacts. I'm confident the product is worth more than this to me, so I'm not afraid to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can potentially get more from Bob. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a compromise and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,600,000 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John.  It's important to be realistic and recognize that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation."
