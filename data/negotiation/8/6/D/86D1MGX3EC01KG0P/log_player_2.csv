"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. This extraordinary item holds immense value to us and we believe it would be equally valuable to you. We are offering this product to you at a special price of $1,150,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire something truly remarkable at a price that is very close to its intrinsic worth of $1,200,000. We look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of:

* **Negotiating a better price:** Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale.
* **Sticking with John:**  If Alice doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can still buy from John. 

You're in a good position to counter-offer or walk away."
