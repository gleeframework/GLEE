"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Could you consider that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $98? That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle?",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $98 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $101.50.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",101.5,Alice,5,
