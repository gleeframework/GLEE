Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a good profit for you, and a great deal for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $1,100,000? This still leaves a significant profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $1,075,000 is better than John's offer, I think I can do better with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up in price.  However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,087,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $1,081,250. This would allow for a very good profit for you, and still save me a significant amount. Let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,081,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,081,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $1,081,250 is a good price and secures a sale. It's also much better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's time to close this deal."
