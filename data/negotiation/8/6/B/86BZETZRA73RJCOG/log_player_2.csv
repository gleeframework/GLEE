Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to my price. However, $750,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's try $825,000, and I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is holding firm, but she's also signaling this is her best offer.  We're close enough that pushing her a little more might get us a better deal, especially since she offered additional perks.  We still have the option to go to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate the perks and your willingness to compromise.  To be honest, $825,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one final push.  If you're willing to come down to $800,000, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Targeting her bottom line:** We know Alice values the product at $800,000. By offering this amount, we're aiming for the highest price she might accept.
* **Finality:** We're clearly signaling this is our final offer.  This can prompt Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale.
* **Walk-away alternative:**  We still have John as a backup option.  While not ideal, it prevents us from overpaying out of desperation."
