"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $800,000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to negotiate to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1800000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this price reflects a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now showing more flexibility, but his offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer. I'll push for a higher price in the next round, keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is encouraging. Let's aim for a win-win situation. How about $1,600,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part, acknowledging your interest while ensuring the product's value is recognized."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob seems fixed at $1,200,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap significantly.  Selling to John guarantees the $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than potentially getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob."
