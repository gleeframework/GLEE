"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $800,000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to negotiate to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this price reflects a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is encouraging. Let's aim for a win-win situation. How about $1,600,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part, acknowledging your interest while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
