Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  Offering it at $20,000 leaves room for him to negotiate down while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's less risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If negotiations fall through, you always have the safety net of selling to John."
