Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling at $150 to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your $150 goal.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is only worth $80 to Bob, offering it at a price slightly above his perceived value might still be tempting if he perceives it as a good deal or has a pressing need for it. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best price from Bob while still ensuring the sale."
