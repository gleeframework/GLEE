I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price."

I'm counter-offering with $135. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum."
