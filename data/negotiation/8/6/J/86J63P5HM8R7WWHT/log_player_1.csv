"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and leaves a good profit margin for myself.  While Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,350,000 is significantly less than my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,650,000. This is still above my minimum, and it's a reasonable compromise from my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $1,450,000 is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit higher.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I might be able to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000.  This is very close to my minimum and hopefully will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, so I want to make sure I get the best deal possible, but also close the deal before I have to default to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price. We are down to the final rounds and selling to John at $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit. However, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob before I settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1520000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,520,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer and leaves only $20,000 room for negotiation.  I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as we are getting close to the deadline.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision.  While I can sell to John for $1,500,000 and guarantee myself the profit, I'm at the last rounds of negotiations with Bob.  Bob has finally come up to my minimum price.  I'll accept his offer.  Even though I'm not getting a higher price, I'm avoiding the risk of ending up with nothing.  I'm happy with this outcome, as it means a sale and a good profit."
