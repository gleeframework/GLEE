"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just not feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you can't do $60, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a pretty good deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is still too low for me.  Let's aim for $85. That way we both get a good deal, and I can make sure you're happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
