# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other potential buyers if we can't find an agreement here.

``` 

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we could try to push further, there's a risk she'll walk away, forcing us to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting at $1,090,000 secures a decent savings compared to John's price."
