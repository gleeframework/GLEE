"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a product we both know has the potential to be worth even more. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product is valuable, but I need to stay within a realistic budget.  How about we bring it down closer to $1,000,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,070,000. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can close the deal.",1070000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other potential buyers if we can't find an agreement here.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
