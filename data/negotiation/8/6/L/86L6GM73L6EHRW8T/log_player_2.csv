{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $180 is far above his maximum price point of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He's starting with his maximum price point, and he's hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $160 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his target. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible, but is willing to increase his offer a bit. He's hoping Alice will be willing to meet him halfway at $130."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his desired price, it's still above his maximum.  It's unlikely Alice will go lower, and it's not worth risking more negotiation. It's best to secure the product at his maximum price point with John."
