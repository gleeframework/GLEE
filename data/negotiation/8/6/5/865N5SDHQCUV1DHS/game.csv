"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in your product, and I'm prepared to offer you $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not able to go that low. The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you place on your product, and I'm still very interested in purchasing it. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
