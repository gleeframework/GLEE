Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still staying above your minimum price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you get more than John's offer if he declines.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119.  He might try to negotiate further down, or he might decline outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still ensuring a sale."
