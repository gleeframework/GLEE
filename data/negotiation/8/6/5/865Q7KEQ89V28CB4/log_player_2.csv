"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low as possible, ideally under $120.  Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price.  Therefore, it's logical to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $120?  That's my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $160. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum of $120. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'll make another concession, and offer it to you for $155. This is my best price, so let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price below $120.  While Alice has moved closer, $155 is still above Bob's maximum.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $145.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'll make another concession, and offer it to you for $152. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $152 is still higher than Bob's maximum of $120.  With only 3 rounds left, it's highly unlikely that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $120, as it guarantees him the lowest price."
