"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $1,000,000, to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. This sets the initial negotiation point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a good amount, I'm aiming for more and believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us are comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get more, $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's what John is offering. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next rounds, and it's better to secure this sale now."
