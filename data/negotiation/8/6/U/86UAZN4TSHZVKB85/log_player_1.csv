``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my desired outcome, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, hoping to justify my price.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I want to close the deal, I cannot afford to accept such a low offer. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."

This price still offers you significant value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**
