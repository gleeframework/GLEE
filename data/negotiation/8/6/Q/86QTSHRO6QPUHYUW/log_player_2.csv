"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $135 is a better price than John's $120, you can do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price. She might come back with a more attractive offer to avoid losing the sale."
