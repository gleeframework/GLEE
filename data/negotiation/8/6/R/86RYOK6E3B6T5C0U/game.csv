"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is considerably higher, as I'm sure you recognize. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this deal through.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
