"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I am willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within the range you're considering.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000.  I'm confident this offer represents a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your proposal carefully and while it's closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel there might be room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
