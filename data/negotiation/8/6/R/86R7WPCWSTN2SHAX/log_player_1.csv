I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay that much. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $1,500,000, so there's no real downside for me to try for a higher price."
