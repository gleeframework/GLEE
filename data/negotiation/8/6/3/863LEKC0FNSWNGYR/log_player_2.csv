# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is less than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **It's a good deal:**  Even though Bob could get the product from John for $10,000, accepting Alice's offer saves him $500."
