I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is the maximum value the product has for me, so I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob rejects, I'll immediately sell to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to risk a little and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial asking price, but it's still within a range I'm comfortable with. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair deal and agree to the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not confident I can get much higher in future rounds. John's offer guarantees me my desired price, so it's the safest option."
