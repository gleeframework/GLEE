"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go any lower than that. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm confident that this price is fair considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $1,000,000. If you're able to come down a little further, I'm ready to close the deal today. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $975,000. I'm confident that this price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
