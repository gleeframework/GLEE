"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it can bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be around $750,000 for this to make sense. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, but I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $775,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",775000.0,Alice,5,
