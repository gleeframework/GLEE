"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $95? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can meet somewhere in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $100 for this product.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair one considering its value.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $97? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go all the way to $100.",97.0,Bob,6,
