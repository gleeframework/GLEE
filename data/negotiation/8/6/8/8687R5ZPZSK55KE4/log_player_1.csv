Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, and I have 9 more rounds to work with."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about $1,275,000?

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I still have some room to negotiate and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can close a deal with Bob at a better price than that."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,302,500 is very close to my minimum price of $1,300,000.  We're running out of rounds, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer from Bob.  It's time to secure the sale and avoid risking a deal with John."
