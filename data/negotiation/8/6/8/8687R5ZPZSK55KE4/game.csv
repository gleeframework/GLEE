"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you in the middle at $1,325,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to finalize this deal. ",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about $1,295,000?",1295000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,310,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs, and I'm confident it's a number we can both agree on. Let's get this deal done.",1310000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,310,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to think about it. Can you meet me at $1,302,500?",1302500.0,Bob,8,
