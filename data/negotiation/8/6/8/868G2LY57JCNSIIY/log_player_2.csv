"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price from John. It's a great deal, so accepting it saves Bob $200,000. There's no need to risk losing the product by counter-offering and potentially having Alice reject it."
