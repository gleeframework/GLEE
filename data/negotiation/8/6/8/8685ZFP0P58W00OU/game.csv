"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $8000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9500? It's still a great deal for you, considering its value.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $9500. Would you be willing to consider $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $7500.  It's clear we're both eager to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $9000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,5,
