"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its worth to you. I understand it may not be your ideal price, but it's a fair compromise considering its value to me.  Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can move to buy from John and save $200,000."
