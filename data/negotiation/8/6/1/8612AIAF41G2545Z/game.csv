"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to come down a bit, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,300,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000?  I believe this price is fair and still allows you to get a great deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to come down to $1,325,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, and I think this price is more reasonable for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I'm willing to consider your offer, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $1,350,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and allows us to make this deal work.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000 again, but I think we can do better. Would you be willing to come down to $1,325,000, and we can discuss the terms of the deal?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
