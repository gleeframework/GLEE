Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $2,200,000 represents a significant gap from the true value of this product. It offers unique advantages that go beyond typical market valuations.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.
