"Alice, your offer is quite high for me.  I'm very interested in the product but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $2,200,000 represents a significant gap from the true value of this product. It offers unique advantages that go beyond typical market valuations.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate that.  Let's find a solution. While $1,200,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm really determined to buy this product, but I can't go higher than $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise and represents the most I can afford. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
