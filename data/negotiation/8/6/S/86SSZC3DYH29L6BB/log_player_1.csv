"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm confident it can be a valuable asset to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. This factors in its potential for growth and return on investment. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable offer. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential for growth and return on investment,"" Alice is subtly anchoring the high price to potential benefits for Bob, even though the initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. His response will provide valuable information for subsequent rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high for me.  I'm very interested in the product but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and Alice could potentially secure a better deal than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $2,200,000 represents a significant gap from the true value of this product. It offers unique advantages that go beyond typical market valuations.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Alice begins by acknowledging Bob's offer and constraints, showing that she respects his position.
* **Reiterating Value:**  She reiterates the product's unique value, subtly pushing back against Bob's lower valuation. 
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  Alice makes a significant concession from her initial offer but remains well above both Bob's offer and her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:**  She frames the new price as a ""middle ground"" and emphasizes fairness, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is now closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price but remains significantly below it. 
* **Potential Upside:** There are still several rounds of negotiation left, and Alice might be able to push Bob closer to the $1,500,000 mark.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John's offer as a guaranteed backup gives Alice leverage. She can continue negotiating with Bob without the pressure of potentially losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate that.  Let's find a solution. While $1,200,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** Alice acknowledges Bob's seriousness and aims for a collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Concession:**  She makes another significant concession, bringing her closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above both her minimum and John's offer.
* **Finality and Compromise:**  The phrasing implies a degree of finality. By saying ""this reflects the true value,"" she's subtly anchoring the price while offering a compromise that's still beneficial for her. 
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, this offer creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm really determined to buy this product, but I can't go higher than $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise and represents the most I can afford. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer is now very close to John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, especially considering the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching Alice's desired price, while John's offer provides a certain and acceptable outcome.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now with John saves time and potential hassle compared to further negotiation rounds with Bob."
