Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $12,000 is a significant discount from your minimum price, but still leaves room for you to make a profit.

I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the information we gain from our conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  While $10,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** I can still counteroffer and aim for a higher price, potentially closer to my minimum. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000. 

I'll counter with an offer closer to $12,000, keeping in mind Bob's budget limitations but also ensuring I get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between his offer ($10,500) and my previous offer ($12,000).
* **Signaling flexibility:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Remaining above my minimum:**  $11,250 is still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I won't lose out on this deal.

I'll continue to analyze Bob's response and adapt my strategy accordingly."
