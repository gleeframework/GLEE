"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $80 for the product. Would you consider this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $90 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $85. This would allow us to reach an agreement within my budget while still providing you with a reasonable return for your product.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $90?  It's a fair price considering the quality of the product, and it gives you a good deal too.  Let's close this out.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've been considering our previous discussions and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $87 for the product. This allows us to stay within my budget while also providing you with a fair return for your efforts.",87.0,Bob,6,
