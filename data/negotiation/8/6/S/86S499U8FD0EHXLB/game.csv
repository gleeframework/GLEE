"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $14,000.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still give you a great value, and allow me to get a bit closer to my target. Let's make this happen! ",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you want to be closer to your target, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  Let's see if we can bridge this gap. I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.  What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,
