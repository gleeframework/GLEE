Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you want to be closer to your target, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
