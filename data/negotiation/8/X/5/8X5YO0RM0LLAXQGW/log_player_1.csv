Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider this my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to go above $10,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures you get your minimum acceptable price without the risk of Bob walking away."
