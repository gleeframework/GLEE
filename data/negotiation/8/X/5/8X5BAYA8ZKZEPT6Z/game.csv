"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While I value your business, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a significant advantage while allowing me to receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and generate substantial returns for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
