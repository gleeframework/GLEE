"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer of $135 is decent, you know you can get the product for $150 from John if necessary. There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
