"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $11,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is too low, and I have a better alternative with John.
