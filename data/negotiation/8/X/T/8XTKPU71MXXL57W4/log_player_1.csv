Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,100,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly better price. Would you consider $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

While $1,175,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to secure a better price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we settle at $1,225,000?  This price is a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,200,000? This seems like a fair price we can both agree on.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

At this point, I'm happy to accept Bob's offer of $1,200,000. This is a good price, and we're running out of rounds. It's better than selling to John and closer to my desired price."
