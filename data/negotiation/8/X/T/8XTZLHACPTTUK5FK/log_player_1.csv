Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more to Bob.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" and offering it to Bob before a public listing, you subtly imply the product is in high demand and he's getting a special opportunity.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), allowing Bob to counter-offer rather than just flatly accepting or rejecting.

**Important Note:** While John represents a ""safety net"" at $12,000, this strategy aims to maximize profit with Bob. There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of a higher sale price makes it a calculated risk."
