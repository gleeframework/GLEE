"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go.",9800.0,Bob,4,
