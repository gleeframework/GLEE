* It's worth attempting to get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

**Reasoning:**

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come back to her original offer of $900,000. 
* While it's still higher than my ideal price, it's lower than John's offer. 
* Accepting this offer saves me $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
