**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting $16,500 now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling completely. It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer or losing the sale to John."
