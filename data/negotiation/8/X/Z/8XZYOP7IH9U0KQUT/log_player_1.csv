Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $120, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to value:** I highlight the potential benefit Bob will get from the product to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can lower the price slightly, but I won't go below my minimum of $150.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving the door open for negotiation and ensuring I don't lose out on a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $90 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down to $110, reflecting both the value of the product and your interest. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I've lowered my price from $120 to $110, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Maintain a buffer:**  $110 is still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

This approach balances my need for a decent profit with the desire to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I am still committed to finding a fair price for your product. I would like to counter with an offer of $100. This is my final offer, as I am also considering purchasing the product from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's statement that he's considering other sellers suggests he may not be willing to go higher.  

Rather than risk further negotiation that may lead to a lower price, I'll secure the guaranteed $150 from John.  This ensures I meet my minimum profit goal and avoid potential losses in the negotiation with Bob."
