"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his $80 value as possible. Starting with a $5 reduction is a reasonable opening move.  It shows he's serious about buying but isn't willing to accept the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product closer to his $80 value. While $87.50 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still a chance to get it even lower. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $87.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be happy to close the deal at $86.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  He's showing flexibility by moving slightly closer to Alice's offer, but still remaining firm in his desire to save money. A small offer like this keeps the negotiation going while signaling that he's serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I can offer the product to you for $88. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget and has more room to negotiate. While $88 is tempting, Bob can still try to secure a lower price. He's shown that he's willing to negotiate and that he's not afraid to walk away if he doesn't get the price he wants.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a better deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $87 for the product.  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price and knows Alice is likely to accept at this point.  He's demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while staying firm on his price point.  By making it ""final,"" he is putting the pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go down to $87, Bob. But I'm willing to meet you halfway between $88 and $87. I can offer the product to you for $88.5. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is getting very close to his target price.  $88.5 is still a good deal for him, especially considering he has only 3 rounds left. There's a risk of Alice not accepting any further counteroffers, and Bob could end up paying $100 to John. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's well within his budget, while still securing a good deal."
