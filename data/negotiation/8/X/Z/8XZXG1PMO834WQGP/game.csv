"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
