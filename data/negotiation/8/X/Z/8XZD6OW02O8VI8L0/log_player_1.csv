Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help Bob feel more inclined to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  A $14,000 starting point allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $12,500?  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $12,500 is tempting, it's still very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in a counteroffer. 
* **Time is on my side:**  As long as I don't sell to John, I have time to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250? It's a fair compromise and I believe it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering $13,250  is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  The message emphasizes that the offer is a ""great deal"" for both of us. This subtly reinforces the value of the product.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $13,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me a little buffer if Bob needs to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us and would allow us to finalize the sale quickly.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the middle:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to the middle ground between my previous offer of $13,250 and his offer of $12,500.
* **Quick finalization:** Bob is emphasizing the quick finalization of the sale, which is a strong incentive for me. 
* **Slightly above minimum:**  $13,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would have liked to get closer to $14,000, this is a solid outcome. 

It's important to note that if I reject this offer and try to counteroffer again, there is a risk that Bob will walk away or continue to bargain.  Accepting his offer gives me a good profit with minimal risk of losing the sale entirely."
