"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer saves you $400,000."
