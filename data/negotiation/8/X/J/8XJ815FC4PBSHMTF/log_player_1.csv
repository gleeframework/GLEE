Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  What do you think about a price of $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Even if Bob rejects your offer, you have a fallback option with John at $80, ensuring you don't lose money. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit by starting with a strong offer while acknowledging Bob's perceived value and leaving space for a potential deal."
