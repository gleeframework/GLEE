Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Gauge Interest:** The initial offer of $19,000 helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counter-offers, you know he's interested but looking for a better price. 
* **Potential for Profit:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's a potential for him to see a price significantly lower than $19,000 as a good deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is prone to walking away from deals, you might want to start slightly lower.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer. Having a clear understanding of your bottom line ($15,000) will help you in the negotiation."
