"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13500? It's a fair price considering the product's potential value to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16500 is still above my budget.  I'm firm at $14000. It's a reasonable compromise that allows us both to make a deal. What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $18000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",18000.0,Alice,7,
