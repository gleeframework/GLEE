"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for $2000000 for it. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on it, my budget allows me to spend no more than $500000 on this purchase. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer the product to you for $1200000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still feel that $1200000 is slightly above my budget. Could we perhaps aim for something closer to $900000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $900000, which would be $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I believe $1050000 is still slightly out of reach for me. Could we possibly aim for $1000000? I think this would be a fair compromise for both parties involved.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price below $1200000. I'm willing to make one final compromise: I'll meet you at $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
