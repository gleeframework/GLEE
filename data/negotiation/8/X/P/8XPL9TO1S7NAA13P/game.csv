"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  How about $7,750? I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
