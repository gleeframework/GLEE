"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $80 to us. I'm starting our negotiation at $120. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price before settling. There's no immediate urgency to buy from John as Alice's offer is already within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value to you. While I'm interested, I'd like to start with a lower price point. How about $100? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to consider it. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still reflects the value we place on the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. Accepting her offer at $110 saves you $10 compared to buying from John and is still within your budget. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
