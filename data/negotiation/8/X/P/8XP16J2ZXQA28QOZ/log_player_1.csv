This offer starts with a relatively high price, but it's still less than my minimum desired value. It also conveys a friendly and enthusiastic tone, which might encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $870,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000.

While $870,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still not enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before selling to John."
