"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $870,000. Can you consider that?",870000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $870,000 is just not feasible for me. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to go down to $890,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about acquiring the product, let's make this happen.",890000.0,Alice,5,
