I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $105, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Would you be interested?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced I want to pay $105. I'd be willing to pay $98 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go.,98.0,Bob,6,
