"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $9,750.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll make the deal",9500.0,Bob,6,
