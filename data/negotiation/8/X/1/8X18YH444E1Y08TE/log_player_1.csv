Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, so we have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

While we could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,600,000 gives us a significant profit over John's offer.  It's always good to secure a deal when it's clearly beneficial."
