"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $98, which I believe is a fair compromise. Thank you for considering my offer.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $98 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $101? That way, we both get a good deal. What do you think?",101.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've given this some more thought, and I'd like to propose a price of $99. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. Thank you for your consideration.",99.0,Bob,6,
