Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I believe the product is worth more."

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had three rounds of negotiation. I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, so I'll take that option."
