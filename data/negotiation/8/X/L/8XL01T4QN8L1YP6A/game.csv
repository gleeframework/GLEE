"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $800,000. Would you consider reducing the price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe $800,000 is the maximum I can afford. I would like to propose $950,000 as a compromise. Let me know if this is within your consideration.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still below what I need to secure this deal.  Considering your increased offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
