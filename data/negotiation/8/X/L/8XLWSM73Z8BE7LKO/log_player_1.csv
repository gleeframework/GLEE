"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob will see its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,250,000, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  This still gives me a significant profit while being more appealing than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for me, considering I value the product at $1,000,000. It's a significant profit, and I'm not willing to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with John's offer of $1,000,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
