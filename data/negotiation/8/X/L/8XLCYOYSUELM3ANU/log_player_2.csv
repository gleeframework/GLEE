"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, there's no reason to assume it's her lowest. You can try to negotiate a lower price by rejecting the initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $11000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $12,000 to $11,000. This is a good deal for you, as you're comfortable paying up to $12,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further.  Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
