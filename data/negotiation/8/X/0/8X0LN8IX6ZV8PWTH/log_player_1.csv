"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept on the first round. This establishes a high baseline and allows me to gauge his interest.  It's also important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any point, so I'm not taking a huge risk with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good amount, I'm confident I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise, while still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's the same as his previous offer, I believe I can still do better. I'm hoping to get him closer to my desired price range. The rounds are ticking away, so I need to act quickly but not be too hasty."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,300,000.  This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.  The pressure is mounting to close the deal, so I need to make a move that is both reasonable and keeps Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, time is running out.  $1,250,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and ending up with only $1,000,000 from John. It's time to lock in the profit."
