"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's offer is $12,000, while John's is $15,000. 
* **It's within Bob's budget:** Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's offer fits within that. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer to save $3,000."
