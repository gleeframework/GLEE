"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room for a good deal.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000. That's the lowest I'm comfortable going.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
