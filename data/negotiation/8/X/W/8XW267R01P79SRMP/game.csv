I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a very competitive price. I think you'll find it's worth every penny.,1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1800000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least 1600000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $1400000, which would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at 1500000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
