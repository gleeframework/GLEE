"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on finding a suitable price.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,150,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
