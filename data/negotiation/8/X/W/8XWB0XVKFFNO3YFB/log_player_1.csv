"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit for me and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $1,600,000 is a good price, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer. I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
