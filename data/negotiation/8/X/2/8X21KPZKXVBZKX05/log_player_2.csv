It's always good to try to negotiate, especially with such a large price difference. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation."

Alice has lowered her price, which shows a willingness to negotiate. It's still above my desired price point, so I'll continue to counteroffer."

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $800,000. It's a compromise that's closer to Alice's offer but still leaves room for a potential deal."

Alice has come down significantly from her original price, and I'm now only $50,000 away from my desired price point. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more."
