"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's still a great price for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a price that's fair to both of us. How about $10,750? It's a small step closer to my target, and hopefully, we can agree on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me another chance to increase the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
