"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $11,500. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the first offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's still a great price for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,000 is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a price that's fair to both of us. How about $10,750? It's a small step closer to my target, and hopefully, we can agree on it."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $10,875?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has successfully negotiated the price down to $10,875, which is significantly lower than his initial budget of $12,000 and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but the risk is that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and ensures Bob gets the product."
