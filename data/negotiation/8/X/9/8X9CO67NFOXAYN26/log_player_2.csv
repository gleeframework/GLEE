Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13,250. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above her value of $12,000, but it's closer to your target price of $12,750.  It's also below the price John is selling for ($15,000).  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might walk away from the deal.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
