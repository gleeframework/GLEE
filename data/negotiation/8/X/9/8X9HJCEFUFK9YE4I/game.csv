"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $2000000 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1200000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount of $200000 from my original price, so I'm now looking for $1800000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1800000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'd be willing to go to $1400000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a discount of $300000 from my previous offer, so I'm now looking for $1500000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally meet at a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
