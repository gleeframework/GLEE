"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $2000000 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiations and attempt to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount of $200000 from my original price, so I'm now looking for $1800000. Is this a more comfortable price for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still above my budget. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a lower price. Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'd be willing to go to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a discount of $300000 from my previous offer, so I'm now looking for $1500000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally meet at a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly what I'm willing to pay, and it's also the same price as buying from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate when I can get the product for the same price with Alice."
