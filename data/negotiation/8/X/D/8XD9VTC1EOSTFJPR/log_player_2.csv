"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $95? I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still more than I want to pay. I've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like she's not willing to go lower.  I'm better off just buying from John at this point."
