"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000? This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.  How about $14,250? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both some room to negotiate. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
