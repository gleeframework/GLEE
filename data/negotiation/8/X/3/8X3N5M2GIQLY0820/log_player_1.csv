"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I understand his perspective, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000? This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.  How about $14,250? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both some room to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum price, Bob's offer is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Given the limited rounds and the risk of further negotiations going south, I'm going to accept John's offer. It guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further risk."
