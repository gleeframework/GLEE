"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that's sure to benefit both of us.  I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle. How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price reflects my budget and the value I believe the product will bring to my business.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price point. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price is closer to your offer and still allows me to achieve a fair return on the value of the product. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $900,000 just isn't enough for me. This product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a strong asset for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $975,000? This price is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable solution for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,7,
