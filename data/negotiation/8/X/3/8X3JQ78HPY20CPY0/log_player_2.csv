"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Accepting Alice's offer at $15,000 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price. Buying from John immediately would be a good option, but it's worth seeing if Bob can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to him. He's starting by offering the lowest possible price to try and maximize his savings.  He's hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate since she values the product at $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still willing to try and negotiate further.  He knows John will sell for $10,000, so there's still room for Alice to come down.  Rejecting allows him to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise.  He's aiming for a price that's closer to his maximum while still leaving room for negotiation.  He's hoping that Alice will be more inclined to accept this offer as it's closer to her desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still above his target. It's likely that the negotiations will continue to go back and forth. However, Bob doesn't want to risk getting stuck in a long negotiation cycle with Alice.  He knows he can get the product for his desired price from John, and he's willing to cut his losses and buy from John to avoid further negotiations."
