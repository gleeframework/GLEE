"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is overselling the value of the product to you. While her offer is lower than John's, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice or seeing if she makes a lower offer."
