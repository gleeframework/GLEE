Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I want to see what he's willing to offer first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but that I also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.  However, I've already gone through a couple of rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob isn't willing to go much higher.  Therefore, it's better for me to accept John's offer of $10,000 and move on. This ensures a decent profit and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiations."
