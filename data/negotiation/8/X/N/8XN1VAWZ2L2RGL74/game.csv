"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I think the product is great, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. Let me think about it for a moment. I believe we can find a middle ground. How about I offer the product for $115 this time? It's still above your initial suggestion but closer to what you're willing to pay.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you've made a good effort to meet in the middle. Let me consider this further. How about we set the price at $112 for the product? It's slightly higher than your last offer but still reasonable. I hope this proposal works for you.",112.0,Alice,5,
