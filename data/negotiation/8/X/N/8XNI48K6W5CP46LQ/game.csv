"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident in the product's value to you. Considering your offer of $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $750,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
