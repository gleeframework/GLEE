"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
