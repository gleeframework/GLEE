"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $750,000 is a good compromise.  It's still significantly less than buying from John, and Bob can likely resell the product for a profit.  Accepting the offer is the best option at this point."
