"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save a substantial amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget. This allows for potential negotiation and reduces the initial price gap.  While $850,000 is still higher than my ideal price, it gives Alice some room to negotiate and shows my serious interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the first round, it's still above my budget. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. To make this deal work, I can offer $900,000. This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows continued negotiation while still being within my budget. Increasing my offer to $900,000 signals my willingness to compromise and demonstrates that I'm seriously considering the deal. This should encourage Alice to come closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and your willingness to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to this deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows continued compromise while staying within my budget. Increasing my offer to $950,000 signals my willingness to negotiate and demonstrates my serious interest in the deal. This should encourage Alice to consider a price closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. Considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and your willingness to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to negotiate significantly lower than $1,000,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely that I'll be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  It's more beneficial for me to purchase the product from John at $800,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and don't waste any more time on negotiations."
