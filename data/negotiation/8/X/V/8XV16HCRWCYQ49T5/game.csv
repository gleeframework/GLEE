"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still above my target price. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $750,000. This would be a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
