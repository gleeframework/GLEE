"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by you. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe we can reach a fair deal. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $110. This price not only reflects the value of the product but also allows us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
