Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a price higher than your minimum.  It's important to remember that:

* **Bob's worth:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $12,000 is your safety net. You can always accept it if the negotiations with Bob fail.
* **The art of negotiation:**  By starting slightly higher, you open the possibility for a mutually beneficial deal. You'll need to be flexible and ready to counter-offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get more than $12,000, it's important to remember:

* **Bob's limit:**  Bob is firm on $12,000, which is his maximum value. 
* **John's offer:** John is also offering $12,000, meaning I have no risk of loss by accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting now saves time and ensures a guaranteed sale at my minimum price. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision in this situation."
