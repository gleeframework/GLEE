Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in discussion and potentially make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. Based on his response, I can adjust my strategy and either accept his counteroffer or make a new counteroffer to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. I am rejecting his offer to explore further negotiation with him. I am not yet ready to sell to John for the minimum price, as there is potential to gain a higher price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to compromise, how about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This still gives you a great deal, and I can ensure a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's constraints:**  I show I'm listening to his concerns, making him feel valued and increasing the chances of agreement.
* **Compromise and middle ground:**  I propose a price that is halfway between our current positions. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Reinforcing the value:** I reiterate the worth of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its potential value.

This counteroffer aims to find a more favorable price while still keeping the negotiation open and maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $12500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's also significantly higher than John's offer.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to maximize my profit while ensuring a sale."
