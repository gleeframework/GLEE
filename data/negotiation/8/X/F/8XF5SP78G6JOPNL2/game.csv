"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 doesn't quite cover the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to compromise, how about we meet in the middle at $12500? This still gives you a great deal, and I can ensure a smooth transaction.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $12500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
