"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $800000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $500000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

I've already compromised a lot, and I think this price is fair considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm open to negotiating further. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",675000.0,Alice,5,
