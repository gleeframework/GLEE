"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
