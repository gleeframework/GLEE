{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I'm confident I can make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer to Bob while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also just slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping that this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also ready to accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $1,500,000, it seems like Bob is unlikely to meet my price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the best course of action at this point."
