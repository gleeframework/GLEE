"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leverage the fact that he wants the product. This will likely get us into a negotiation, allowing me to explore options and potentially secure a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round.  While John's offer is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm countering with $12,500. This is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to my minimum.  I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting lower, and it's getting risky to keep going.  While I'd prefer to get a better deal, John's offer of $12,000 is within my minimum and guarantees a sale. It's time to secure the sale and minimize the risk of Bob continuing to lower his offer."
