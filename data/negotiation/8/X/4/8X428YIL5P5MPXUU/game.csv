"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make a smart business decision.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  That's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is my absolute maximum. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
