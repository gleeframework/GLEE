"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. This strategy balances the desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged and potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's worth risking another round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product.  However, Bob's ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to budge further, and I've already had three rounds of negotiations.  To avoid potentially going through more rounds with uncertain results, I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $800,000. This ensures I get my minimum and saves time and potential frustration."
