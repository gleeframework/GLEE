"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a bit higher than what it's worth to him, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and how many rounds are left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell it for that low of a price, especially since I have several rounds left.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $85. This is still a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's closer to my minimum price.  I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility, we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum price, so I'm going to accept it.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer or we'll run out of rounds before we reach an agreement. It's better to secure the deal now, especially since John is also willing to pay $80."
