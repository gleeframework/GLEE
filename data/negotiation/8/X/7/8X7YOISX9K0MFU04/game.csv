"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
