"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and potential benefits. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue this conversation. However, $12000 is still significantly below the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $14000 is the lowest I can go. This price still reflects the value of the product while accommodating your budget.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'm willing to offer $11500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",11500.0,Bob,6,
