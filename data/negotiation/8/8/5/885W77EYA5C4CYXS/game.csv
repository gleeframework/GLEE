"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $10,500 is still a bit below my current value for the product.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,750.  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,600, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this revised offer?",10600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,600 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,650. This is a very small difference, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  It's time to close this deal. What do you say?",10650.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this revised offer?",10500.0,Bob,8,
