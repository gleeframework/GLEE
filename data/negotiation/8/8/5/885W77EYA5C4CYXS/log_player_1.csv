"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using open-ended questions to invite Bob to counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible. 
* **Keep Options Open:** I can always switch to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Be Flexible:** I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's counteroffers, but I'll be firm on my minimum value."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to push for a better deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Stay Firm:** I won't settle for a low price just yet. 
* **Counter-Offer:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:** If Bob becomes unreasonable, I'll move on to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,600 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,650. This is a very small difference, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  It's time to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10650}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this revised offer?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob has shown willingness to compromise, his offer of $10,500 is still significantly lower than my desired price point.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob will remain steadfast at $10,500, and I'm running out of time.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $15,000, which is more secure than continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure Profit:**  John's offer provides a reliable and profitable solution. 
* **Time is limited:**  With only two rounds left, the chances of getting a significantly better deal from Bob are slim.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiations and potential losses."
