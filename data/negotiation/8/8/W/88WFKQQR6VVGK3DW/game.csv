"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's close this deal and make it mutually beneficial!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking something closer to $700,000 would be a fair deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $850,000 is my absolute minimum.  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",775000.0,Bob,4,
