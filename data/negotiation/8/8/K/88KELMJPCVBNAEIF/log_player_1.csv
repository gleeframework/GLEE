Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your minimum, hinting at the product's value to Bob can make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price further, allowing Bob to feel involved in the process.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest in the product."
