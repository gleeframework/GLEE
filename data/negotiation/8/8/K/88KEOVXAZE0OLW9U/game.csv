,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,875?  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,875. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,6,
