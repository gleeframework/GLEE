"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a substantial discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a good deal for both of us. Let's settle this now.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
