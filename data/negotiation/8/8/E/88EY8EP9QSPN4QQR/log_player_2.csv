"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a substantial discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Even though Alice has come down to $1,300,000,  Bob can still try to lower the price further. 
* **Close to John's price:**  $1,300,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,500,000, so Bob doesn't want to rush into accepting just yet.
* **Strategic counteroffers:** By rejecting and making another counteroffer, Bob can potentially get a better deal and avoid buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a good deal for both of us. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,250,000.
* **Close to Target:** This price is significantly lower than John's $1,500,000, and closer to Bob's desired price range. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate, forcing Bob to either buy from John or walk away empty-handed. 

It's likely that Bob can't get a much lower price, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
