"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $120. Would you like to make it yours?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, so how about $102.50? I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a bit of a concession to get the deal done.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $98. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you at $99, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",99.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $99, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $96. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",96.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $99, and now you're asking me to go down to $96. I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $97. That's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",97.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $97, but I'm still not sure if that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a good deal. I'm going to make one final offer of $95. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",95.0,Bob,10,
