"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go up to $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $12,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. How about $9,000? I think that's a fair offer considering my budget constraints.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
