Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,700,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This amount still allows me to invest in the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a significant compromise.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us to both benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. This amount still keeps the deal within my financial limits while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's very close to what I'd get from John.  It's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely."
