"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,800 is the lowest I can go right now. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,400. Can you consider that?",8400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,400 is simply too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $8,600 as a final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I might have to consider other options.",8600.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,300 is still too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,450. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere.",8450.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really close to my budget, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",8200.0,Bob,8,
