"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product.  Considering its value, I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a good tone for the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $9,500 is a good starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate lower if needed.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" Option:**  At this stage, I want to see if I can strike a deal with Bob.  The ""John"" option is my fallback if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's tempting to take $8,200, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 8 rounds left, which gives me time to try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll need to counter with a price higher than $8,200 but lower than my initial offer, to keep negotiations moving.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,800 is the lowest I can go right now. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I've lowered my price to $8,800, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to give away too much too early. 
* **Show Flexibility:** By acknowledging Bob's perspective and lowering the price, I demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also setting a clear limit.
* **Keep Negotiations Moving:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,400. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** We have 6 rounds left, and I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal.
* **Counter with a Higher Price:** I'll need to counter with a price above $8,400 to see if we can reach a compromise.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,400 is simply too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $8,600 as a final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer signals that I'm nearing my limit and am serious about getting a deal done.
* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a small concession, dropping the price by $200 from the previous round. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate but also sets a firm stance.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly hints at the possibility of selling to John, adding pressure to Bob.
* **Closing the Gap:**  $8,600 leaves a small gap that might incentivize Bob to make a final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I still need to save a bit more. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,300. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have 4 rounds left, and while I'm tempted to take $8,300, I think there's still room to negotiate a better price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer to see if we can reach a compromise in the remaining rounds.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,300 is still too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,450. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 8450}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my absolute final offer, emphasizing urgency and leaving less room for further negotiation.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a slight concession, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""looking elsewhere"" subtly reminds Bob of the limited rounds remaining and the possibility of me selling to John.
* **Reasonable Price:** $8,450 is closer to Bob's budget and is still significantly higher than his initial offer, giving him a good deal.

This counteroffer puts the ball in Bob's court. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to sell to John or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We only have two rounds left.  It's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will budge much further.
* **Risk of Settling Too Low:**  Accepting $8,200 would mean I'm selling the product for significantly less than my minimum acceptable price and less than what John is offering.
* **Better Option:** Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is a much better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point.

It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John."
