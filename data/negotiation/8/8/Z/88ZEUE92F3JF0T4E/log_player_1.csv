Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer Alice could send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing Alice a great deal.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies that if Bob waits too long, he might miss out, subtly encouraging a quicker decision. 
* **Confident but not Greedy:** The tone is confident in the product's value but doesn't explicitly demand the full $12,000, making Bob feel like he might be getting a slightly better deal.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He could:

* **Accept:** Great outcome for Alice!
* **Counter Offer:** Negotiation begins.
* **Reject:** Alice sells to John for her minimum acceptable price."
