"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer the product for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about $800,000?  That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
