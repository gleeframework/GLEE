"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer the product for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.
