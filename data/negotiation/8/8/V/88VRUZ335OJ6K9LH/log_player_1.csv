Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and I still stand to make a good profit. I'll also be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low and accept John's $1,000,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, but I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be a sweet spot that Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low. It's closer to John's offer than my desired price, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will yield a better result.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to secure a safe profit."
