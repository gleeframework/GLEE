"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly less than its true market value. While I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a very competitive price. Let me know if you're interested.
