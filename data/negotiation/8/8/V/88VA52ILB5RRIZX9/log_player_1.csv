Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have another interested party."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer that still provides you a significant profit margin.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning another interested party creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate a slightly lower price."
