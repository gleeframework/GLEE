{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is less than the price from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $1,050,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for potential negotiation. This offer is also within Bob's maximum budget and provides a good starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still a chance to push for a lower price. Rejecting allows for another round of negotiation to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible, but recognizes that Alice is unlikely to go significantly lower.  This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a higher price than Bob's previous offer while still remaining below Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while aiming for a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is only $30,000 above Bob's last counteroffer and is significantly lower than John's price.  Further negotiation could take more time and may not lead to a substantially better deal. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a favorable price within Bob's budget."
