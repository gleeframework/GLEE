"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your limit. There's no immediate reason to accept.  By rejecting, you open the possibility of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $130 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about we split the difference at $140?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price.  $140 is still within my budget and a good compromise.  There's a chance she'll come down further, but it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely."
