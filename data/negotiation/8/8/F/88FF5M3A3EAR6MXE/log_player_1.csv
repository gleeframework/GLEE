Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm also aware that John is a guaranteed buyer at $150, so I can afford to be a little firm in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept it and sell the product, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob, because I have the option of selling to John for $150 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value.  I think this is a fair compromise, and Bob might be more likely to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely.  It's also possible that John might not be available if I reject Bob's offer. So, I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob for $130."
