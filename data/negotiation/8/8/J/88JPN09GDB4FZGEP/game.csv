"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  While $1,350,000 is certainly appealing, the value this product represents is significantly higher for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
