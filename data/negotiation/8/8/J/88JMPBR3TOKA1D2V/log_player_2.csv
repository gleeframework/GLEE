"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, making it an attractive starting point. However, there's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price. It's always beneficial to try and negotiate, especially when you have a clear upper limit in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a strong negotiating position and signals my willingness to bargain.  A 25% reduction is a significant drop, and I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to engage further. If she rejects this offer, we can continue to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I believe there's still room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  There's no need to rush into a deal, especially since I have the option to purchase from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to meet Alice halfway by offering $800,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'm willing to move slightly higher in the next round but I'll aim to stay below $850,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and we're now within a reasonable range. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that she could become more stubborn and we could end up back at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal without risking further haggling."
