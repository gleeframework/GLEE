"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $11,500.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price slightly above that, giving Alice a little profit while still getting a good deal himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Since Bob has more rounds to negotiate, he should continue to try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. He's still below Alice's offer, but closer to a potential agreement. This gives Alice a chance to consider, but Bob can still walk away to John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now above Bob's maximum price. It's better for Bob to buy from John at $12,000.  While he'd prefer to save a little more, it's more important to not overspend his budget.  This decision ensures Bob gets the product within his price range."
