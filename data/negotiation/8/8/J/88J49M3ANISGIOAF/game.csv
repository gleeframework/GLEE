"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $15,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
