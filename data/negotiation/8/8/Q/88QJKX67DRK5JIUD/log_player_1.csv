"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can get him closer to that in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I think is still a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I'd like, I still feel I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial asking price, but I want to ensure we can finalize a deal. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but no higher. Is there any room for further negotiation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me and gets me closer to my goal.  It's also better than selling to John at $1,000,000. With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing this deal completely."
