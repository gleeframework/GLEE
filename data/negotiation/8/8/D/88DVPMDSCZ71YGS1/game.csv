"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle at $16,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This would give you a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
