Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit and leaves some room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $9000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could you consider $9100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target,  $9,100 is a decent compromise.  It's closer to my minimum and accepting this offer allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially losing the sale to Bob altogether."
