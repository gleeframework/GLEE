"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still quite attached to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not willing to go below $130, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $130. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'll offer it to you for $129. That's as low as I can go. Take it or leave it.",129.0,Alice,7,
