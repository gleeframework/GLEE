Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point that gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that the price is below what the product is worth to Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By not going all-in on the highest possible price, I allow for counteroffers and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer of $8,000, which acts as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is still a good profit for me, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to potentially push for a higher price.
* **Avoiding the ""Sell to John"" Trap:**  While $8,000 is a guaranteed profit, I'm aiming for a better deal.  Selling to John would mean settling for the minimum, which is not my goal. 

I will proceed with a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further and meet you at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but proposing a counter-offer of $11,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value Again:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him,  emphasizing that $11,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can make this deal happen!"" subtly adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

This counteroffer maintains a balanced approach, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement while keeping my profit margin in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is the highest I can go. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:**  $10,500 is significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000 and still provides a substantial profit.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a lower offer.
* **Avoiding Risk:** While I could try to counter-offer again, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I would be left with only the $8,000 offer from John.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit with minimal risk, considering the current stage of negotiation."
