"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further and meet you at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can make this deal happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is the highest I can go. Can you consider it?",10500.0,Bob,4,
