,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,5,
