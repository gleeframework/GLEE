"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can do better than $950,000. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still in a better position to negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is still more than you want to pay, but you can likely get Alice down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $885,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is offering a price that's still below your maximum threshold of $1,000,000, and it's getting closer to your desired price. It's likely you won't be able to negotiate much lower, so accepting her offer is the best option to save money and secure the product."
