"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $13,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way too high, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price. There's no need to waste rounds negotiating with Alice when a better option is available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is capped at $8,000. Let's start there and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Bob can still get the product from John for a much lower price. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet.  It's better to continue negotiating with Alice, but always keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
