"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is capped at $8,000. Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
