"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting because it's close to my maximum, it's still above my ideal price. I can try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still gives you a decent profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is still above my maximum price point of $10,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely that I'll be able to convince Alice to go lower.  John's offer of $10,000 is the best deal available, so I'll accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
