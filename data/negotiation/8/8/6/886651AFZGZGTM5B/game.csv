"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still gives you a decent profit.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
