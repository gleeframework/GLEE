{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to make this transaction worthwhile for both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you significant leverage in the negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 allows you to capture a substantial portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a $100,000 gain. 
* **Backup Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, ensuring you don't settle for anything less than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By phrasing the offer as time-sensitive and exclusive, you create a sense of urgency and importance, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
