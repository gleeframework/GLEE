"Hi Alice, $200 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $200 might be a bit high, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find a solution.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but I need to get at least $140 for it to be worth my while. This is a final offer - what do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,
