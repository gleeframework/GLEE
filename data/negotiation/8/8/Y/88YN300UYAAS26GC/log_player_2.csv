Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $200 might be a bit high, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice is willing to come down a bit, her final offer is still above my $100 limit.  I'm going to go with John's offer.  It's a good deal and it keeps me within my budget."
