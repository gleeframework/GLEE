"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I'm not sure if it's worth it for me. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Let me know what you think!",9200.0,Bob,4,
