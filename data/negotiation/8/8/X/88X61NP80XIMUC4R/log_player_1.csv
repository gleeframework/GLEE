"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get a better offer than $100 by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110 in this round. I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's initial offer of $100, and I'm still above my minimum of $100. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
