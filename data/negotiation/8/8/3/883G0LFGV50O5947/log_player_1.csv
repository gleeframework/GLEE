I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $1,400,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement!"

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,350,000 is a good price, considering that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000. It's time to close the deal!"
