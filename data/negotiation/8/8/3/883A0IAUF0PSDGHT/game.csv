"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
