Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'd like to resolve this deal today.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly signaling that he won't go much higher. He's mentioned an alternative option at $800,000 and is giving a ""take it or leave it"" vibe.  While $900,000 is a good chunk of money, we have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John. It's better to take the sure thing and maximize profit than risk Bob walking away in the next few rounds."
