Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I believe we can close the gap slightly. I propose a final price of $10,750 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $10,750, which is only $250 more than my target price of $10,500. It's likely that we won't get a better deal with further negotiations.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid risking getting stuck with John's higher price."
