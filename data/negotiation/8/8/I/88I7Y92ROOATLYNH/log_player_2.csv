This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the same product from John for $800,000, saving you $200,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better choice."
