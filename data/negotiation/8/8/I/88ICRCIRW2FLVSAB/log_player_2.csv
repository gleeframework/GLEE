# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $920,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and getting the product for $920,000 is a decent deal compared to John's $1,000,000 offer. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk losing out by pushing too hard."
