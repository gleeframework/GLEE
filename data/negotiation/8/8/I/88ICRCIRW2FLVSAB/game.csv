"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $920,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further.",920000.0,Alice,5,
