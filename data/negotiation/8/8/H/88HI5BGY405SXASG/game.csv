"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 falls a bit short of what I'm aiming for.  I'm confident this product can bring you significant value exceeding that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? ",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm definitely interested in this product.  However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $975,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen. How about $1,000,000.  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value this product brings.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, and $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction.  However, to make this deal work for me, I need to stay at $975,000.  It's a fair price, and we're both close to a deal.  Let's finalize it at that number, and I'll be happy to close immediately.",975000.0,Bob,6,
