"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $800,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, it is a great product!  Let's make this happen. How about $737,500?",737500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $742,500. This is as close to my target as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",742500.0,Alice,7,
