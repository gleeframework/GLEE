Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,750,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a price of $1,750,000 aims to capture some of the perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 provides Alice a strong fallback position, allowing her to confidently negotiate for a higher price with Bob."
