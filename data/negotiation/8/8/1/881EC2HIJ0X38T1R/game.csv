"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000. How about we try $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000 again, as I was willing to do in Round 4. Can you reconsider and meet me at this price?",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This shows my commitment to working with you, but it's really as low as I can go.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's make this deal happen.",1325000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,275,000 and $1,325,000. How about we try $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
