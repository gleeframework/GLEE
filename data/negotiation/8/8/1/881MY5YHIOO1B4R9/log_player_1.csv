Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's value of $12,000, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but still closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's a better price than selling to John.  It's also a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's previous rejection.  I'm confident that I've maximized my potential profit in this situation."
