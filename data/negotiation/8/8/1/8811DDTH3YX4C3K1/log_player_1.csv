Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's still a good profit margin for me.  If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to counter or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $130. It's still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but that I'm also confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter again. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to offer $115. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and accept, but I'm also prepared to go to John if necessary."
