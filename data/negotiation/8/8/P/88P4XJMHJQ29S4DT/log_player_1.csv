"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be prepared to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me with a reasonable profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal quickly and accept this offer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer, potentially closing the deal at a price closer to my target."

{""product_price"": 850000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $820,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since we've both been moving closer to each other in the last few rounds.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 835000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $835,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm confident that it will be attractive to Bob.  At this point, I'm hoping to close the deal quickly before we reach the end of our negotiation rounds."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I don't want to risk a counteroffer from him that could be even lower.  John is a sure bet at $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. I'll sell to John and avoid the risk of a lower price or a stalemate."
