I am extending this exclusive offer to you at a special price of $950,000, aiming to create a win-win situation where we can both benefit from this transaction.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I am confident that you will find the product to be a valuable addition to your endeavors.

This is a no-brainer. Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly less than your $1,200,000 maximum and the $1,200,000 John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you a considerable amount of money."
