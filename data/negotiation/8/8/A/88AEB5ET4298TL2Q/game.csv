"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for the product. Would that be something you'd consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  This product is truly top-of-the-line, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a great product, but $17,000 is still more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about we settle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
