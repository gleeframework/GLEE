I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's interested, $11,500 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer of $11,800 is still too low for me, and I'm not sure how much more we can negotiate.  I'd rather guarantee myself a good price by selling to John."
