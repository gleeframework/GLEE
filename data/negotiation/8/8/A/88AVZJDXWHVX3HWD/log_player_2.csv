"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move, but it aims to quickly establish a lower price range and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. If Alice is willing to sell at a lower price, this counteroffer will likely lead to a quicker deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  While it's higher than my initial counteroffer, it's still a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price and minimizes risk."
