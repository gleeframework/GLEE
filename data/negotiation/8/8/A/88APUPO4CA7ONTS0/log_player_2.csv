(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get a better deal by counteroffering again. You're still better off with John's offer at this point, but there's a chance you can squeeze out a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a significant increase from your previous offer but still below Alice's current offer.  This shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate but also have a limit. You're hoping this will be a sweet spot where Alice might accept to avoid further haggling."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and she's showing no signs of budging significantly. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John. You've negotiated with Alice and demonstrated your willingness to pay a fair price, but she's not being reasonable.  It's time to secure the product at a price you can afford."
