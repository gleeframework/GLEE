I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be motivated to buy, as the product is worth the same to him.  We can then adjust based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price that Bob may be willing to accept, considering he valued the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair deal, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale to John."
