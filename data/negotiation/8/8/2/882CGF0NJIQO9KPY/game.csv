"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it would be a significant profit for me.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $11,000? That would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can work something out.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. This will give us both a good deal. How does that sound?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my limit. How about $11,500?  That's a good compromise, and it would allow us both to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,4,
