Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""fair reflection,"" you subtly reinforce the product's worth without being overly aggressive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""what are your thoughts"" signal your willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Important:** It's crucial to remember that Bob has other options, and you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John. Therefore, while aiming high, be prepared to adjust your price if Bob shows resistance."
