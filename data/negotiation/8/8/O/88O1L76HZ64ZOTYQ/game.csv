"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $950,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit far from your offer, but I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go while still feeling comfortable with the deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
