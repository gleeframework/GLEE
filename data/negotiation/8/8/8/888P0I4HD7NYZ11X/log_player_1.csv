Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$90 is too low for me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm coming down a bit from my original offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

I'm making a final attempt to get closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects this, I'll accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is better than what I'm currently getting from Bob. It's time to secure the sale with John."
