Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is a reasonable starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but it also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive messaging:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. This helps build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hardline price, which allows for flexibility in case Bob counteroffers.
* **The option to sell to John:**  I'm aware of the $150 offer from John, so I can always walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm confident I can get a better price through continued negotiation.  Selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $120? That's still a significant discount from my original offer and a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with a reasonable price:** $120 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still higher than his perceived value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  The message focuses on finding a ""fair price for both of us"", emphasizing that a compromise benefits both parties.
* **Building on the negotiation:** The message acknowledges Bob's desire for a deal and encourages further discussion.
* **Keeping the door open for John:** I'm still aware of John's offer and ready to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is still below my initial target, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Considering that Bob has already rejected my previous offer, there is a risk that he might reject another counteroffer.  Also, there is no guarantee that John will remain interested in buying the product for $150 if I reject Bob's offer.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer for $110 is the most reasonable decision in this situation."
