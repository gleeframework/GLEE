Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a similar product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay up to $100 for this product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob, as he's already shown interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $110. That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I'm still looking for a product within my budget. Could we possibly come to an agreement at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is now offering $105, which is closer to my minimum price of $100.  While I'd love to get closer to $110, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close the deal."
