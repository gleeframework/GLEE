"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $12,000 is just too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still leaves you a good amount of value, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $14,000, but it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and gives you a valuable product.  Let's close this deal!",15000.0,Alice,5,
