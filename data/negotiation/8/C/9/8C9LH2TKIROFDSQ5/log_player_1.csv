"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price ($18,000) because:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $15,000**:  This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Bob's value is $10,000**: This means there's potential for a deal where we both benefit. 

I'm also framing the offer positively, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **There are more rounds:**  I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident I can get a better price than $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $12,000 is just too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still leaves you a good amount of value, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards Bob's offer:**  I've lowered my price from $18,000 to $16,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $16,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will still get at $16,000. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $16,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **I'm confident in getting a better price:** I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. There's still room to increase the offer.  
* **Selling to John is an option:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum but also try to understand Bob's budget constraints to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $14,000, but it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and gives you a valuable product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I've reached my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Strong message:** I've made it clear that this is my absolute minimum and I'm ready to close the deal.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept or reject:** Bob will now either accept my offer or reject it.
* **Final round:** If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer or sell to John for $15,000."
