"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he has plenty of time to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $12,000 is just too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still leaves you a good amount of value, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $16,000 is still a bit too high. He can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy from John for $10,000, which is his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $16,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $14,000, but it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and gives you a valuable product.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is at his limit:** $15,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* **Time is running out:** There are only 5 rounds left, and each round decreases the potential for a better deal.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  John is offering a guaranteed price within Bob's budget.

While there's a chance Alice might come down further, it's a risk.  Bob has already tried negotiating and has a reliable alternative.  It's smarter to secure the product at his desired price than to gamble on further negotiations."
