I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer, but I believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more.  If he rejects, I'll still get my minimum price of $1,000,000 from John.  This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while still having a fallback option."
