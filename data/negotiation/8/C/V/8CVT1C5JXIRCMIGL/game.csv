"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  It's the most I can afford, and I think it's a fair price considering your value for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to the product's value for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $13,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.  Otherwise, I'll be forced to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,6,
