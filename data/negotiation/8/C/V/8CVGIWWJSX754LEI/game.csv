"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $10000. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
