Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 if Bob accepts. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $14,000 is a price point likely to be tempting to Bob (saving him $2,000 compared to his perceived value) while still being highly profitable for you. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential reward of the higher sale price outweighs the risk in this scenario."
