Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offering price:** $13,000 is a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my reservation price (the price I'd sell to John). This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still getting me a decent profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It emphasizes the value of the product to him and highlights the potential savings. 

This strategy allows me to potentially maximize my earnings by getting a price closer to my reservation price while still having a backup buyer in John."
