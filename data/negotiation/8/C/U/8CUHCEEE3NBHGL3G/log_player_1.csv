Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start a dialogue. 

This strategy balances my need for profit with the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then assess his counteroffer and continue the negotiation, or choose to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a nice product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below Bob's perceived value of $80.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  While I could sell to John immediately for $120, I have room for negotiation with Bob. It's possible I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.  

I will now proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85 to make this deal work. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility. $85 is a middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and assuring Bob he'll be ""happy"" with it. This helps to build trust and potentially increase his willingness to pay more.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.

By rejecting Bob's initial offer and making a counteroffer, I'm increasing the chance of a successful deal while still protecting my profit margin."
