Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum. I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While you can try to negotiate further, Alice has already lowered her price from $900,000 to $875,000. This is close to your maximum budget of $800,000 and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a reasonable price."
