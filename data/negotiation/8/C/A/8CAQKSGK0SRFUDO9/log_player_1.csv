{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000. This reflects a significant discount for you, and it's still a good profit for me.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

* **Exploring Counter-offer:** There's still room for a counter-offer that would be more beneficial to me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterating Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's efforts to negotiate but reaffirming my position that his offer is too low.

* **Still a Decent Profit:**  While $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my initial goal, it's still a better price than selling to John. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I want to see if I can push Bob just a little bit further.  If I accept this offer, I might regret not trying to squeeze out a little more. 
* **Potentially Reaching an Agreement:** There's still a possibility that I can convince Bob to increase his offer slightly in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential to get a better price outweighs the risk of losing the deal completely."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Goal Reached:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 meets my minimum goal of earning at least $800,000 for the product.
* **Last Round:** This is the final round of negotiations, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer if I reject Bob's proposal.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Accepting this offer is better than selling to John for $800,000, as I'll earn an additional $50,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, a successful transaction with Bob could lead to potential future business opportunities."
