,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000. This reflects a significant discount for you, and it's still a good profit for me.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,050,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
