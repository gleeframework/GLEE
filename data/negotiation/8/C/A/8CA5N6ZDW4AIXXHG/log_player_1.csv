Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

While $1,550,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can reach an agreement before I have to consider selling to John."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. We're already in the latter half of the rounds, so I need to try to secure a better price before I have to consider selling to John."

While $1,585,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little more before I have to consider John's offer.  We're down to the wire, but I still have a chance to get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer of $1,590,000 is very close to my minimum, and he's made it clear that this is his final offer.  If I reject it, he'll go to John, and I'll only get $1,200,000.  It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale, even if it's just a little bit above my minimum."
