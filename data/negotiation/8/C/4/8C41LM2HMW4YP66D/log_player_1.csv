Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable in the right hands. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with him for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000?  This is a compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's fair considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although I'm running out of time, I still believe there's room for a better deal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us. If you're truly interested in this product, I believe this is the best we can do."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at my offer of $1000000. Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob seems unwilling to budge from his $1,000,000 offer, and I'm running out of time. While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  I don't want to risk losing out completely. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do under the circumstances."
