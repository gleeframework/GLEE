"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable in the right hands. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1250000?  This is a compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's fair considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This is a fair price for both of us. If you're truly interested in this product, I believe this is the best we can do.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at my offer of $1000000. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
