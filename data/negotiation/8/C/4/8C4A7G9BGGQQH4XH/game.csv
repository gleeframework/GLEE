"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? Let's make this happen.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit higher than your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,500? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I see we're getting closer.  $12,500 is still above what I'm willing to pay, but I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,250. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,250. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we do $12,375? It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",12375.0,Alice,7,
