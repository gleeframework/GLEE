"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
