Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but not overly aggressive.  It gives us room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to risk further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to my minimum price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick sale, I'll sell the product to John for $100. It's a guaranteed profit and a faster transaction."
