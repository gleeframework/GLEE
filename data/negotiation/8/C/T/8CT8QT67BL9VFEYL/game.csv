"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Can we meet in the middle and discuss further?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $2,300,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your budgetary constraints.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, taking into account the value you've placed on the product. I'm thinking of $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
