"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm  prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,750,000.  I'm confident this is a price that reflects its worth and potential.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand the product is valuable to you, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
