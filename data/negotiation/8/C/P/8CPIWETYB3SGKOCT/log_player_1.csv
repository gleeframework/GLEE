Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm  prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand the product is valuable to you, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still significantly below John's standing offer. It's unlikely Bob will reach $1,500,000, so it's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John."
