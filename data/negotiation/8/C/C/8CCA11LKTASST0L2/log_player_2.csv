"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's also very close to your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  This suggests there's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget at this time.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd like to start with an offer of $700,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to move forward with a deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer. I'm going to reject it and try to push for a lower price.  It seems like we're getting closer to a deal, and there's still some wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  To finalize this deal, I'd like to offer $775,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the effort we've put into the negotiation so far, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good outcome for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is her minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, as I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance she won't go lower, so it's better to accept the offer now rather than risk losing the deal and having to pay more to John."
