Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $100, which is $110. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $110, and it's better for me to get the product for $100 from John than to waste more time negotiating."
