"Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $170 is far higher than your maximum budget of $120. 
* Buying from John for $120 is the best option, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range where I'm willing to potentially buy. 
* This will give Alice room to counter without immediately rejecting my offer. 
* It's a starting point for negotiation and allows me to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $135 is still above my ideal price, but it's close to my maximum budget of $120. 
*  It's worth considering the potential risks of continuing to negotiate.  
* If I reject this offer, Alice may not be willing to go lower, and I may end up having to buy from John at $120. 
* Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product while staying within a reasonable price range."
