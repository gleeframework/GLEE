Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic to start negotiations. I'll be willing to negotiate down, but I'm aiming for a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to sell the product for less than my minimum price of $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while still leaving some room for me to profit."
