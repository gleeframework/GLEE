"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for me.  It's still a significant saving from the original price of $1,000,000, and  it's only $50,000 more than my counteroffer.  I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
