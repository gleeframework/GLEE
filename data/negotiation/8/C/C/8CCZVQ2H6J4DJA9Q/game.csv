"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value it will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business.",10000.0,Alice,5,
