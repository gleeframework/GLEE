Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $135 allows for potential negotiation, as I'm aware Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone can encourage Bob to be more open to negotiation. 

I'm willing to go down in price, but not below my minimum of $150. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I'm open to negotiation, I believe there's still room to find a price closer to my desired range.
* **Sell to John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option. If the negotiation with Bob falls apart, I'll still be able to sell the product for my minimum desired price. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $100, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. I believe this is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $125 is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  This price is still above my minimum of $150, allowing me to make a profit.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  I'm expressing a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on my value for the product.  

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.  I'm also keeping John as a backup option in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
