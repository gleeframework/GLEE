I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $1,200,000, but it gives Bob room to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always work down from this starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than my minimum price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,300,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is just a little over my minimum price, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects, I'll accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price, so I'll accept it. While John's offer is the same, it's always preferable to sell to the buyer who is most motivated, which in this case appears to be Bob after all this negotiation."
