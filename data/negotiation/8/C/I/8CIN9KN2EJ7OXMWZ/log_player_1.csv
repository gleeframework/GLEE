Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is fair to both parties.  It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to go higher.  I am also stating the value to Bob to try and motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly below the product's worth to Bob. I believe I can secure a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a fair deal considering the value of the product to him.  There is no need to continue negotiating further."
