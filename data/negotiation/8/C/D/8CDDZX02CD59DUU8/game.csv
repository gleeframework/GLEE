"Thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to share it. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? This would allow us to both reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to keep your expenses within a certain budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I still believe that $15000 represents a fair price given the value of the product. I am hoping that we might be able to find common ground closer to this figure. I look forward to your response.",15000.0,Bob,4,
