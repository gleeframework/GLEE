Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm asking for $1,800,000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting higher gives room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the value without revealing our hand.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message invites further discussion, signaling we're open to finding a price that works for both parties.

**Worst case scenario:** Bob rejects the offer. We haven't lost anything and can proceed to sell to John for our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
