# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can save $500 compared to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. You save $1,000 compared to buying from John, and it's only $500 more than your initial counteroffer."
