"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price just for you, Bob! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price further.  You're not losing anything at this point by trying to negotiate a better deal."
