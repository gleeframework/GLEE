"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I've set the price at $1,300,000, reflecting its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for both parties to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to make a substantial investment. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:**  $1,200,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is a price Bob can comfortably afford.
* **Time is a factor:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice getting impatient and choosing to sell to another buyer.
* **Jhon's offer:**  Alice's offer is still better than buying from Jhon, which would cost Bob $1,500,000. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a decent deal and avoids potentially losing the product altogether."
