"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the return on investment you can expect. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm eager to strike a deal, $1,300,000 is a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?
