"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to the product's true value. Considering your initial reaction to my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth while still being reasonable for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
