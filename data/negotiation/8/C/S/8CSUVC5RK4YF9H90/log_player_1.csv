"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.  I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but still leaves me room to gain a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, showing that I am willing to negotiate, but also emphasizing that I'm confident in the value of my product.  This offer is a good middle ground that might tempt Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $855,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $855,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to his own valuation, it's still significantly below what I need.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can reach a more agreeable price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $900,000, so if Bob doesn't come closer, I may have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, but I'm still not willing to settle for much less than $900,000.  This counteroffer is a small concession, but it shows I'm willing to meet halfway. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has been going on for a while, and Bob's offers are not getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is a guaranteed profit."
