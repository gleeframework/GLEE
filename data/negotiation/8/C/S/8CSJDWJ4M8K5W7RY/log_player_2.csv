Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target price, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
We're now at a point where Alice is offering the product for $990,000.  While you could try to push for $950,000, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and you risk losing the deal entirely. Buying from John would mean paying $1,000,000. Accepting the $990,000 offer secures a saving of $10,000 compared to your fallback option."
