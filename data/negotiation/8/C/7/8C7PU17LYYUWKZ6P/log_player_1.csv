Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $150 allows room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significant profit. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always lower the price or move on to John."
