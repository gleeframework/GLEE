"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is a bit out of my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is understandable, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential returns this product offers.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
