Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is a bit out of my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,700,000 is still above my maximum. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,450,000.  This is a substantial amount, and I believe it reflects a reasonable compromise.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still less than what John is offering. There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and I'm better off taking the sure thing with John at this point."
