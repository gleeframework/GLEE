"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $95. This is still above your ideal price point.  While it's a better deal than buying from John, you can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and hoping she counters with a lower price."
