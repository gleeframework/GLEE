"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm completely happy with. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to do $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to Alice's price, but still maintaining a position that gives us some bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a better price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95. How about we try $100.50? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$100.50 is a fair price. It's a good deal below John's offer and close enough to Alice's value that it's likely the best we'll get."
