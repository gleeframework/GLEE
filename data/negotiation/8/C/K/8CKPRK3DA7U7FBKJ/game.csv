"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  This gives you a good deal, and I can still get a fair price for my product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800, and I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price point.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $9,900. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9900.0,Bob,6,
