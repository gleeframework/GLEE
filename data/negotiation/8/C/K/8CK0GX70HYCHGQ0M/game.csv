"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. After considering your budget and the value you see in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, while still being within your budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still beyond what I can afford right now.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my commitment to reaching a deal.  I believe this price fairly balances our respective needs.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to see you're committed to finding a mutually beneficial deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value I place on the product and the fact that we're getting close to the deadline, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again if you're willing to meet me at $1,025,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for your product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident we can close this deal if you accept.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to go up to $950,000. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you there yet. Considering the value I place on the product and the fact that we're getting closer to the deadline, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with a price of $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.
