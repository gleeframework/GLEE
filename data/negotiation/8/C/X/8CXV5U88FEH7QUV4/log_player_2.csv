Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer.

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $70 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $70, which would be $85. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price range, her offer of $85 is still higher than John's offer of $80. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice. John provides a guaranteed price that meets your budget."
