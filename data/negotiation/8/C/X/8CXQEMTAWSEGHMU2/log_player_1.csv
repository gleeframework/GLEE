Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,500,000 to be satisfied.  
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you're in a strong position. You don't need to negotiate with Bob below your minimum. The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay more than your guaranteed price.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **Justification:** While you don't need to explicitly justify the price, the phrase ""given its unique value"" subtly implies that you believe it's worth more than Bob might initially think.
* **Open to Negotiation:** You end with an invitation to discuss, signaling some flexibility while not appearing desperate.

**Outcome Scenarios**

1. **Bob Accepts:** You make a significant profit above your minimum.
2. **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to negotiate down slightly while still staying above your $1,500,000 guarantee.
3. **Bob Rejects:** You proceed to sell to John at your guaranteed price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have all the information and Bob is a rational actor. Real-world negotiations can be more complex, with factors like relationships and time constraints playing a role."
