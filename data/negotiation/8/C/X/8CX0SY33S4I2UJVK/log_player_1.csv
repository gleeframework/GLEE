Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate down a bit, but not too far.  I'll keep John in mind as my backup option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price, so I will reject his offer. I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to go up to $90? I'm confident this product is worth that much to you, and I'm willing to compromise a bit to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
