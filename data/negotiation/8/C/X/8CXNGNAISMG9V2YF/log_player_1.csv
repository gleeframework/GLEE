Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Split the Difference:** A price of $12,000 splits the difference between your minimum ($8,000) and Bob's valuation ($15,000). This creates a win-win situation where you get a significant profit and Bob gets a good deal compared to his perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:** While you have John as a backup, it's always better to secure the highest possible price first."
