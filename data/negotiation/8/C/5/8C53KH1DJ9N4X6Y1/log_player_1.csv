"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's really worthwhile and I'm confident you'll find it useful. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is his ceiling price, and he's unlikely to go any higher.  Since I can sell to John for the same amount, it makes the most sense to take the guaranteed sale with John and move on."
