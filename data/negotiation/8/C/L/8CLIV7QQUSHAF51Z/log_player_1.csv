{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm flexible and willing to compromise, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone, making the negotiation more appealing for Bob.

This approach balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to keep the negotiation going and avoid losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation room:** Bob's rejection of my initial offer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I can still make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. 
* **Potential to reach a compromise:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to reach a price that is closer to my target while still being appealing to Bob. 

Selling to John right now would guarantee me $15,000, but there's still a chance to get a higher price from Bob with a carefully crafted counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $16,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's initial counteroffer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Maintaining flexibility:** I'm still expressing a willingness to negotiate, keeping the door open for further compromise.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for countering. $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is just below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might walk away, and I'd only be able to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Potential for future negotiation:** Even though it's slightly below my minimum, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and potentially open the door for future transactions with Bob. 

Given the close proximity to my minimum price and the potential for future business with Bob, accepting his offer is the best choice in this situation."
