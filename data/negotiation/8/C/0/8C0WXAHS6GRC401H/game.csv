"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe it's a great product, but I have to consider my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, the product's value is truly significant, and $600,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $800,000?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $765,000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further than that. Can we meet at that price?",765000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product, and we're almost there.  Let's close this out - how about $770,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",770000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $765,000. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can we finalize the deal at that price?",765000.0,Bob,8,
