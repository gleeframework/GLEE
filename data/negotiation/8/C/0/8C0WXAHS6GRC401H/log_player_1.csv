Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, the product's value is truly significant, and $600,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $800,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

We're still significantly below the product's value and have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $765,000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further than that. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $765,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Bob is clearly willing to pay more than his initial offers.  We have four rounds left and can afford to push him a little further before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $765,000. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can we finalize the deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems to have hit his limit and is unlikely to budge significantly from $765,000. Accepting this offer gives us a profit of $765,000, which is a good outcome considering we have limited rounds left and risk losing a substantial amount if we push further and fail."
