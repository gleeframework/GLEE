"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Being friendly:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport with Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value difference:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's room to negotiate further, and I'm confident I can secure a better price.
* **Risk assessment:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I'm willing to risk another round to potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his offer while still maintaining a profit for myself.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Open to negotiation (again):** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation open and encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer is almost exactly halfway between my last offer ($95) and his previous offer ($90). This shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **Profit margin:**  While it's not my ideal price, $92.50 is still above my minimum of $100 and a decent profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a higher price, but the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale with a good profit."
