Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a clear understanding of my expectations while still allowing for a potentially profitable deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer of $900,000.  While this is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $920,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
