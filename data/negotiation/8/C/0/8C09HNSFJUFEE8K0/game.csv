"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1400000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while staying within my financial constraints.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the value of the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1300000, which is a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can find a common ground at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints.  Let's see if we can split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1325000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1325000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm prepared to offer $1310000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
