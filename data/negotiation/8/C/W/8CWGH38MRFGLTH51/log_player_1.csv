"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it can be a huge asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and John's offer. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a deal closer to my desired outcome.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, assuring Bob that this is a starting point, not an ultimatum. 
* **Value Emphasis:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to me, the message subtly implies its high value by highlighting its potential benefits for Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how serious and flexible he is.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Even if he counters significantly lower, it sets a higher baseline for negotiation.
3. **Maintain the Option of John:**  I retain the ability to walk away and accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob prove unfruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. Accepting at this point would be leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,200,000 is a significant jump, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,700,000. This reflects the true worth and potential this product holds. Are you open to finding a middle ground in that range?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counter-offer and appreciating his willingness to negotiate. This maintains a positive tone and encourages further discussion.
* **Significant but Gradual Reduction:** I've decreased my asking price, but not drastically.  The reduction from $1,900,000 to $1,700,000 signals some flexibility while still aiming high. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its potential benefits and justifying the higher price point.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for further negotiation by asking if Bob is open to finding a ""middle ground."" This keeps the conversation flowing and avoids a stalemate. 

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage Movement:** By lowering my price, I encourage Bob to potentially increase his offer further.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:**  I'm not drastically lowering my expectations, showing I'm serious about a fair deal.
3. **Keep John as an Option:** While engaging with Bob, I retain the ability to walk away if his counteroffers remain unacceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. While I'd ideally like to secure a price closer to $1,700,000, Bob's offer represents a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 

Here's why accepting makes sense now:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,400,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Momentum Shifting:** Bob's offer jumped significantly this round, indicating a possible plateau in his willingness to pay more.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I receive the funds sooner, allowing for quicker reinvestment or utilization.

While there's a chance Bob might offer more, the risk of him lowering his offer or negotiations stalling outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. Accepting at $1,400,000 secures a strong profit and avoids potential complications."
