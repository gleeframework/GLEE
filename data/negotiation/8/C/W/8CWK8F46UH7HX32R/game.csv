"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, $1,000,000 is a bit more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value this product brings is truly unique.  Would you consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $950,000 is still outside of what I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
