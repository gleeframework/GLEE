"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're beginning significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" we aim to anchor the price in Bob's mind at a higher level.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the guaranteed offer from John ($1,500,000) in mind provides a safety net. We don't want to settle too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its value and my potential gains. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is better than John's offer, but there's still a significant gap between his offer and our desired outcome.  We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of undervaluing the product. We will provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of what I consider fair value. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a more realistic proposal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession from our initial price to show Bob we're willing to negotiate and find common ground. However, the decrease is calculated; we're still well above both his offer and John's offer.
* **Firmness:** The language remains firm. We're ""open to negotiation"" but require a ""more realistic proposal."" This reinforces the value of the product. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're mindful of the remaining rounds and want to encourage Bob to move closer to a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to continue our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's guaranteed price, we're still in a position to negotiate for a better deal. We'll continue to make strategic concessions but hold firm on a price above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To keep this moving, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Measured Concession:**  We are making another significant concession, but it's smaller than the previous one. This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Shifting Tone:** The language becomes slightly more conciliatory (""to keep this moving"", ""desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement""). This signals we're getting closer to a point where a deal might be struck. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're still comfortably above John's offer, giving us room for potential further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above the $1,500,000 John is willing to pay.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling negotiations.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
