"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its value and my potential gains.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of what I consider fair value. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a more realistic proposal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to continue our negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To keep this moving, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
