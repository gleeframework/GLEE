"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price of $120. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  $110 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120, but it's closer.  However, Bob can still potentially get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay $120 for the product, and Alice's offer of $125 is getting closer to his maximum price. However, he still wants to save some money. By offering $115, Bob is showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product but still wants a better price. This counteroffer is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $122 is only slightly better than John's price of $120. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her further increasing the price, or refusing to budge.  Since John offers a price that is within Bob's budget and a guaranteed deal, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase from John at this time."
