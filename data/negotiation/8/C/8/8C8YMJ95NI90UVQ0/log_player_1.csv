"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm being positive and encouraging to hopefully get Bob interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for room to negotiate down if necessary, especially if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

This is a good starting point to see how Bob responds and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement from his perceived value, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If the negotiation stalls, I can always sell to John for my minimum price. 

By rejecting this offer, I can control the negotiation and work towards a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that considers your budget and my value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $9,500 is a good compromise point, potentially acceptable for both of us. It shows flexibility while still being closer to my desired price point.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message is positive and emphasizes finding common ground. This keeps the negotiation amicable and open to possibilities.

This counteroffer helps move the negotiation forward and hopefully leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is a fair price that shows my willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have 6 rounds left, and I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my minimum.  
* **John as a fallback:** I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart. 

By rejecting this offer, I maintain my position and continue the negotiation, hoping to reach a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that shows my flexibility while still recognizing the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small concession, but still above minimum:** I'm making a small concession, but I'm still keeping the price above my minimum.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also value the product.
* **Building towards agreement:** This counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's offer, making a deal more likely.  
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message remains positive and encouraging, keeping the negotiation amicable.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 one last time, as it's a fair price that we can both agree on. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  Bob has stubbornly stuck to his price of $9,000. It seems he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Time is running out:** I only have 4 rounds left, and I'm not confident I can convince him to increase his offer.
* **John's offer is much better:** John is willing to pay $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer and is above my minimum price.

This situation calls for a strategic decision. It's better to secure a higher price with John than risk getting stuck with Bob's lower offer. It's time to end the negotiation with Bob and move forward with the more favorable deal."
