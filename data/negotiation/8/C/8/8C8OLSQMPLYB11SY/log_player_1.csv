Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This price gives Bob an incentive to negotiate while still ensuring I get a significant return on my investment.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can always come down a little, but I'm not going to start too low and leave myself with little negotiating power. 
* **The John Option:** The knowledge that I have a guaranteed sale for $15,000 with John gives me a strong bargaining position and prevents me from getting too desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my desired outcome and closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can show that I'm not desperate and maintain my bargaining power.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  Rejecting allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **The John Option:** The option to sell to John for $15,000 gives me a strong safety net, and I can afford to be more selective in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Price:**  $10,000 is a reasonable midpoint between my last offer and Bob's.  It's still a good profit for me, but also more appealing to Bob than my previous offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I haven't dropped my price too drastically, which keeps my negotiating position strong. 
* **The John Option:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm at this price point if Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down to $10,000, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Close Enough:** While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at that price.
* **Maintaining Bargaining Power:** Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not desperate and am confident in the product's value.
* **The John Option:**  I have a solid fallback option with John, which allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation.
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:** I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While I'm willing to work with you,  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $9,750.  It's a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit. 
* **The Final Push:** I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to seal the deal with Bob. 
* **The John Option:** I still have the option to sell to John, giving me the confidence to stand firm on this price.

This offer balances a desire for a good profit with the risk of further negotiation breakdown. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John."
