Round 5

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

**Explanation:** Alice's price is going in the wrong direction. It's clear she's having trouble moving significantly below her initial offer.  It's better to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $1,000,000 than risk further negotiation with Alice."
