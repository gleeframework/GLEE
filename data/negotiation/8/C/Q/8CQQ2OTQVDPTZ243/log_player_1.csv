"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly implies I'm willing to negotiate, setting the stage for a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  While I could accept his offer, I have leverage because I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price. 
* **Strategic Counter-offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, potentially leading to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm using a counter-offer to push Bob closer to my desired price range.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This approach can be seen as fair and encouraging. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation going smoothly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher amount, giving me strong leverage in this negotiation. 
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $9,800 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference again - how about $10,150? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Bridge the Gap:**  I'm using a counteroffer that again splits the difference, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not dropping my price too drastically, reminding Bob that I have a fallback option with John.
* **Positive and Persuasive:**  I'm using language like ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see this as a good solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still far below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Time is a Factor:** While I have 10 rounds, we're already halfway through the negotiation process. It's important to keep moving towards a more favorable outcome.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm still confident I can get a better price, especially considering my fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your concern about finding common ground.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's bridge the gap one more time. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and shows my commitment to working with you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm again using a counteroffer to split the difference, but this time I'm showing a larger concession to signal my willingness to close the deal.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize the ""significant reduction"" to highlight my flexibility. 
* **Time Pressure:** I'm aiming to push Bob towards a decision before the remaining rounds become a risk.  
* **Positive and Direct:** I'm using assertive language to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a substantial profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss compared to selling to John. 

Given the limited time and the guaranteed higher profit with John, it's strategically sound to sell to John and secure the deal."
