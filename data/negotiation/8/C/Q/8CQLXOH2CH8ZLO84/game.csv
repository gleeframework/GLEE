"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on it and the potential savings for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the original price I had in mind.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $850,000 is a good step in the right direction, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for the product. This would be a win-win, giving you a fair profit and allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
