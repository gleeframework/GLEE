"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
