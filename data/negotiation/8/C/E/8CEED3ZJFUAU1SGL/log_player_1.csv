Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. It's also appealing to Bob because it's less than his perceived value.  This strategy aims to maximize my profits while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $8,000 and a decent profit for me. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit without risking a further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a sale to John for the lower price."
