Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $120. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get $120, Bob is clearly sticking to a lower price point. Accepting his offer of $110 is still a significant profit over John's standing offer of $80. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
