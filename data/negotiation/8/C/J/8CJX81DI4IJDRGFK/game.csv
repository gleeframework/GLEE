"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm still aiming for a bit higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $127? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to my budget as possible.",127.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $127 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $129?  It's just a couple of dollars more, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",125.0,Bob,6,
