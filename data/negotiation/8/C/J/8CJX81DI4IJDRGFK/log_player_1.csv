Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit, but it leaves room for counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob understands what you're offering. 

This allows for a potentially successful negotiation with Bob while also having John as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than Bob's initial value of $120, it's still below my minimum of $150. It's more beneficial to try and push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm still aiming for a bit higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate without significantly lowering my price.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  It shows a compromise, which is crucial for a successful negotiation. 
* **Positive messaging:**  A friendly and respectful tone can make Bob more receptive to the counteroffer. 

This counteroffer allows for continued negotiation, keeps the price above my minimum, and keeps the conversation open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $127? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to my budget as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $127 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my ideal price point.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I want to try and push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $127 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $129?  It's just a couple of dollars more, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 129} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not willing to accept Bob's last offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value can encourage him to agree to a slightly higher price. 
* **Positive framing:**  A friendly tone and emphasis on compromise can help keep the negotiation positive. 

This counteroffer aims to achieve a fair price close to my minimum while keeping the negotiation going with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise further.  It's better to sell the product to John for $150 and ensure I get the price I need.  This will also save time and effort since the negotiation with Bob has reached a stalemate."
