"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds tremendous value. I'm confident it could be worth significantly more than $1000000 to the right person.  To demonstrate my confidence, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a price that reflects the potential I see in this product, while still leaving room for you to profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
