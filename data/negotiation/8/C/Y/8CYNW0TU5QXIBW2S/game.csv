"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get a valuable asset at a fair price, and me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can work together to make this happen.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
