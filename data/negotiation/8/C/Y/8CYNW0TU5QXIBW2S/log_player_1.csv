{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get a valuable asset at a fair price, and me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired value.  It's also a good deal for Bob.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more and potentially having Bob walk away or me having to sell to John for less."
