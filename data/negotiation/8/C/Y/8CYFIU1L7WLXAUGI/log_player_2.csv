Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $70, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go down to $80. It's better to cut your losses and go with your sure option of buying from John at your target price."
