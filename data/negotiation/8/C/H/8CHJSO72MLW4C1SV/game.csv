"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for it, which still leaves significant profit for you and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for $900,000. Considering its true value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the profit I'll make and the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
