Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for it, which still leaves significant profit for you and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for $900,000.
