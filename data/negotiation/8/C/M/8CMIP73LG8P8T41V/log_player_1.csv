Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to reflect the value we both see in this product. This price still gives you a significant margin for profit while ensuring I meet my minimum target. Let's continue this conversation and see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be open to discussing a price of $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still determined to get closer to my desired price. I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and it's clear we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference between our last offers. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good profit for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you be open to discussing a price of $1,062,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get even closer to my desired price, $1,062,500 is significantly higher than John's offer and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
