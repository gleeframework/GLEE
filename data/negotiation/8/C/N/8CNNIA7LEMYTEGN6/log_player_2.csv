"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing.**  She claims she'll sell the product for $10,000 to another buyer if you refuse, but that's a $3,000 loss for her. It's unlikely she'd do that.
* **You have leverage.** You know John will sell you the product for $15,000. This is your fallback option.
* **Potential for a better deal.** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to her actual value of $10,000. 

Let's see if Alice comes back with a better offer."
