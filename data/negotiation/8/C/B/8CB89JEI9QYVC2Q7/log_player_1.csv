Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA, as John is willing to pay your full value for the product ($1,500,000).
* **Bob's Perspective:** The product is worth less to Bob ($1,000,000) than it is to you.
* **The Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 (minimum Bob would pay) and $1,499,999 (maximum you could theoretically charge before reaching John's offer) represents a potential deal.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, knowing you have John as a backup.  However, greed could lead to Bob rejecting the offer.  It's a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a deal.

**My Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong but not Outrageous:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for him to see it as a reasonable deal if he values the product's unique aspects.
* **Confident Language:** The message uses positive language (""pleased,"" ""opportunity,"" ""fair"") to frame the offer attractively.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a range in mind ($1,350,000 - $1,450,000) will help you make quick decisions.
* **Don't Reveal John:**  Knowing about your guaranteed sale to John weakens your negotiating position."
