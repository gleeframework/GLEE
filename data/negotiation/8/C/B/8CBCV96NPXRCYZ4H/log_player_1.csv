Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit.  I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by framing the offer as a ""great deal."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my investment under $10,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I need to prioritize my own financial needs. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point."

```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and the potential benefit for both of us. This approach aims to maintain a constructive dialogue while protecting my financial interests."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $10,500? This would allow me to purchase the item without exceeding my spending limit.
