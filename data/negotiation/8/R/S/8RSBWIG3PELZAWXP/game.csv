"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $1200000 is a bit below what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000.  This price reflects the unique value of the product. Let me know if you're agreeable to this offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000, as I mentioned earlier, or I could go up to $1250000. Let's meet somewhere in between.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While $1250000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target.  To move forward, I'd need to see $1300000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to come up to this figure.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit short of $1300000. I'd be willing to pay $1250000, which is the same as my previous offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
