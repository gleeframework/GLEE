Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would be willing to make a deal exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  This is significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly explain the price, allowing Bob to consider its ""unique value"" without a direct counterpoint. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  The offer implies you might be open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate or walk away knowing you have John as a backup."
