"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile for me. I'm offering $1050000. This represents a significant compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
