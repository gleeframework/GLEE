"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should give me a good starting point without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with a price of $130 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $130 again. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still stuck at $130. While I'm tempted to take the deal, I'm going to keep pushing.  I have John as a backup and I'm not losing much by playing it out a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $130 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $132.50.  I think this is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with $132. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then having John change his mind.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and relatively decent outcome."
