"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11,500 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's a fair compromise and would allow us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your spirit, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. It's a sweet spot for me, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
