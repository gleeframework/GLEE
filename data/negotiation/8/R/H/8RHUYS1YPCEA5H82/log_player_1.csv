Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $12,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives him some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to participate in the negotiation. It acknowledges the product's value to me, but also shows my willingness to compromise. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, doing so would result in a significant loss for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's so far below my floor. I will counteroffer and try to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $11,000 is a compromise. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's counteroffer and closer to my desired price point. 
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm. I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate my own value for the product. I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to undervalue what I'm selling. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation going while still maintaining a favorable position for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his final offer of $9,800 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to risk selling the product for such a low price.

Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price of $15,000, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiations with Bob.  This ensures I get the best possible price for my product and eliminates the risk of further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
