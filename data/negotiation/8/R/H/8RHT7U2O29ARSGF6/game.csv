"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the offer, but I'm really looking for a price closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That would be a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
