# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way too high.  It's significantly above your maximum budget and even more than the product's worth to her. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I think it's a fair price given our negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high, but it's a better offer than her initial one.  It's still above your budget, but it's closer to your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This offer is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it is a fair reflection of the value of this product for both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above your budget, and while it's getting closer, it's not worth risking further negotiation. You've already made significant concessions, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further. It's more efficient and financially beneficial to buy from John at $8,000, ensuring you stay within your budget and avoid further negotiation."
