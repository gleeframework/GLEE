# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to see if he can get a better deal.  $85 is still a good profit for Alice, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is a lower offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price range.  He has 7 rounds left and can continue to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.75?"", ""product_price"": 88.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again offering a price that's a compromise, but still closer to his desired price point. It's  a fair offer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $91? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still above Bob's desired price range. With 5 rounds remaining, he can continue negotiating for a better price. Bob is clearly willing to go back and forth, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to go up to $89.50.  Is that something we can work with?"", ""product_price"": 89.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly. He's trying to find a price that's acceptable to both parties. With 4 rounds remaining, Bob is getting closer to his target price and can continue to negotiate effectively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we try $90.25? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price range, but $90.25 is still a bit too high for Bob. With 3 rounds remaining, he has time to continue negotiating for a better price. He can likely get the price down to his target price of $89.50 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum, but I'm also very close to my maximum.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $89.50.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 89.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is reiterating his previous offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product at this price.  With only 2 rounds remaining, he's putting pressure on Alice to accept his offer.  He's also reminding Alice that he's willing to walk away if she doesn't accept.  This could motivate Alice to agree to his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your last offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $89.75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering $89.75, which is very close to Bob's last offer of $89.50. It's a great price for Bob, considering his goal was to save as much money as possible. With only one round remaining, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and Bob risks losing the opportunity to buy the product at this price. It's a wise decision for Bob to accept the offer and close the deal."
