"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also leaves you with a profit of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000).  It's a better deal than buying from John."
