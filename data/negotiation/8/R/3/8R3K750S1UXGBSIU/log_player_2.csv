It's getting down to the wire, and Alice is not budging. I've made several counteroffers, but we haven't reached a price I'm comfortable with. To avoid risking the deal falling apart completely, I'm going to buy the product from John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's within my budget and guarantees I get the product."
