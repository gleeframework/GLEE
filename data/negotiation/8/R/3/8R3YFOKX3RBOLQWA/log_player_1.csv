Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer leaves some room for negotiation but still secures a decent profit for me. I'm willing to go lower if Bob counteroffers, but I won't go below my minimum price of $12,000, as I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep the price below $13000 if possible. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price and still gives me a profit. Accepting it is the best course of action to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick sale."
