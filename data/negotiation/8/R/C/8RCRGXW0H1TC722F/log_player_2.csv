# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer but still higher than Bob's desired price.**  This is a good sign that Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John would be cheaper, but there is a chance of getting a lower price from Alice.**  It's worth accepting Alice's offer and potentially saving a few more dollars.
* **Accepting this offer would mean a $175,000 savings compared to Alice's initial offer.** This is a significant amount of money for Bob."
