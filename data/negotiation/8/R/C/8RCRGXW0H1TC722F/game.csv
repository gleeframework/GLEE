"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $1,175,000.
