"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
