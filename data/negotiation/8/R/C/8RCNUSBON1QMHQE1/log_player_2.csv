"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and John is offering the product for that price. It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer."
