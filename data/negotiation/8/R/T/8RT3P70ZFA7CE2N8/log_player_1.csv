Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly anchoring Bob's mind to a higher price point.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message implies you're open to discussing the price, which encourages Bob to engage if he's interested.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject it outright.
* You have a strong fallback position with John, so you don't need to feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
