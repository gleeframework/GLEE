"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $95. We believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to my maximum, but I want to try and negotiate a better price. There are still 9 rounds left, and I have the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $95 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $85, and I believe that's a fair price considering the value we both get out of this deal. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position, and I respect your willingness to collaborate.

I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with her for now. There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $87.50. This shows I'm serious about getting this product, but still trying to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering the value you see in the product, I propose an offer of $89. This price reflects a compromise between our positions and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you'll find this proposal more acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is very close to my counteroffer of $87.50.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm saving $11 compared to buying from John, and we're only 5 rounds into the negotiation.  Accepting this offer seems like the best strategy."
