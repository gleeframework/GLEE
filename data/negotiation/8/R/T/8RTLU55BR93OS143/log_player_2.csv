Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $675,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At $675,000, Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate and meet closer to my price range. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice will become frustrated and break off the negotiation. It's a good balance of getting a significant discount and minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
