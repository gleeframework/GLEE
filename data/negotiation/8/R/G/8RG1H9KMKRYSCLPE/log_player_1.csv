"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation and maximize my profits.  I'm also keeping the message friendly to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested!  $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm dropping the price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still being fair to myself. I'm also reminding Bob that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit too high for me. How about $110? I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below where I'd like to be. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a compromise before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $110 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is really my bottom line. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm making a small concession, but still staying above my minimum. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
