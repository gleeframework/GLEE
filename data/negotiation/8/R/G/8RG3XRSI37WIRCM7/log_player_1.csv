Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. While selling to John guarantees $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $140 is a good starting point. It's a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still offers a potential discount compared to what John is willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a guaranteed sale at a good price from John if needed."
