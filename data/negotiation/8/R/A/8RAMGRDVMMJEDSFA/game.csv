,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,260,000 as a final offer.  This represents a significant compromise on my part.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price.",1260000.0,Alice,5,
