Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're close, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, so I'm willing to meet you halfway as well. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $10,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Since John is selling the product for $8,000, it's the best option for Bob."
