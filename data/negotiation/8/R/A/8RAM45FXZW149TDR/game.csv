"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only looking to spend around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go down to $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're close, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, so I'm willing to meet you halfway as well. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",10500.0,Alice,5,
