Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $1,600,000 is too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000?  This price reflects a more reasonable compromise while still acknowledging the true value of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be candid, I need to get at least $1,200,000 for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?  It's my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer at that amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her bottom line is $1,200,000. This is above your maximum budget and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000. It's no longer strategically advantageous to continue negotiating with Alice."
