"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,225,000? This accounts for the product's true worth and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While I'm aiming for a higher return, I value closing this deal. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the value you're gaining.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000 is too high. I can do $1,075,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
