"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm confident it's worth more than that to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value Bob will get, which could incentivize him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, indicating I'm willing to negotiate.

**Note:** This is just a starting point. Depending on Bob's response, I'll need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the value of the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob has come up in price, his offer is still $4,000 below my minimum. 
* **I have room to negotiate:**  I still have 9 rounds to potentially negotiate a better price.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale for $15,000, giving me a strong position to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will likely counter with a price closer to my minimum, but I need to carefully consider how aggressive to be. I want to reach a compromise but not lose out on potential profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I can't accept $11,000.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Minimum:** I'm reducing my price by $1,000, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential he'll gain.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I use language like ""meet in the middle"" to encourage a sense of collaboration and a sense of urgency to close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to assess Bob's response. If he rejects again, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or to accept John's offer.  My approach will depend on how much room I believe there is for further compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, but I'm unable to agree to $13,000. Considering the value to me, I'd like to propose $12,500 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is still $2,500 below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:** We've already gone through several rounds, and there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **John's Offer Provides Security:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, giving me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price that is closer to my minimum but still allows for a potential compromise.  I'll likely aim for something like $14,000 to see if we can close the deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer, I need to be at a price that reflects the value of this product to me.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Minimum:**  I'm  moving closer to my minimum, showing flexibility.
* **Focusing on Compromise:**  I'm reiterating ""meet you halfway"" to emphasize a desire for a mutual benefit.
* **Urgency & Closure:**  I'm trying to push for a deal, using language like ""What do you say?"" to encourage a quick decision.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Respectfully, I can't agree to $14,000. Given its value to me, I'd like to suggest $13,750 as a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,750 is still $1,250 below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We only have 4 rounds left, making time a factor in the negotiation.
* **John's Offer Provides a Strong Backup:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, providing me with a safety net and leverage.

**Next Steps:**

I will need to be more assertive in my counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, maybe around $14,500, to try and close the deal in the remaining rounds. If Bob doesn't come closer, I might consider accepting his offer in the next round to avoid losing out on time."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand your position, but I need to be at a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $14,500. It's a fair price, and it's the last concession I can make.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** I'm raising my price to $14,500, only $500 below my minimum, showing I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Final Concession:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my ""last concession"" to create a sense of urgency and put pressure on Bob.
* **Closing Language:** I'm using phrases like ""Let's get this deal done!"" to push for a quick decision.

**Next Steps:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm taking a more assertive approach.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next offer or move on to John.  The decision will depend on how much I'm willing to compromise and how confident I am in getting a better offer from John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the value to me, I propose $14,250 as a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,250 is only $750 below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have two rounds left, and there is a good chance that Bob will not increase his offer in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get closer to my minimum, there is also a chance that Bob might walk away, leaving me with nothing. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk.

**Next Steps:**

I am accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and maximize my potential earnings. While I would have preferred to get closer to my minimum, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential gain from further negotiation."
