"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm confident it's worth more than that to me.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the value of the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I can't accept $11,000.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice's perspective, but I'm unable to agree to $13,000. Considering the value to me, I'd like to propose $12,500 as a compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer, I need to be at a price that reflects the value of this product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. It's a fair compromise that will benefit us both.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Respectfully, I can't agree to $14,000. Given its value to me, I'd like to suggest $13,750 as a fair compromise.",13750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close! I understand your position, but I need to be at a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $14,500. It's a fair price, and it's the last concession I can make.  Let's get this deal done!",14500.0,Alice,7,
