"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. Even though Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum, it's still a good amount above what the product is worth to Alice. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's still below his maximum budget of $15,000, and it's a good compromise considering Alice's initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price."
