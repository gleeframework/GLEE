"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exceptional product to you for $10,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the unique opportunity. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  This reflects the fair value I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $8,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $9,500, Bob is getting a good deal, and it's still better than buying from John. Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high at this point."
