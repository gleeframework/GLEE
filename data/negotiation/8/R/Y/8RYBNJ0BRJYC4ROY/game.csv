"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the unique opportunity. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  This reflects the fair value I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $8,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",9500.0,Alice,3,
