Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $500 of potential profit for Bob, making him likely to consider the offer.
* **It's a clear and direct proposal:** The message is concise and focuses on the price, making it easy for Bob to understand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is more than your minimum, it's still a significant loss compared to your initial offer and Bob's potential value for the product.  Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a reasonable profit for you.
* **Reasoning:** The message clearly explains your reasoning, showing that you're willing to negotiate but also maintaining your value for the product. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and focused on reaching an agreement, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you're already close to your minimum and the negotiation process might be prolonged. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees you a secure and acceptable profit, without the risk of further price reductions from Bob."
