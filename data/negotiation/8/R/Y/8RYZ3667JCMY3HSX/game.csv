"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider it?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, $1400000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1350000. Can you consider it?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit short on budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1350000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1500000, which is my absolute minimum price. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1450000. Can you consider it?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still not willing to meet me at my minimum price, Bob. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $1480000. This is my last offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1480000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1420000, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider it?",1420000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm disappointed that we're still so far apart, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final offer to you, and it's a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1480000, which is the same price I offered in round 7. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options.",1480000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made concessions, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1480000. I've already gone as high as I can, and I'm not willing to go any further. I think we're at an impasse. I'm going to have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000 instead.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
