(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $15,000 is still a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but this is my final offer. I'm confident that the product is worth this price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to close the deal now than to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with less."
