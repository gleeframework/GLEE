"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you get out of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target.  There are still several rounds left, so I'll continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you. I'm open to hearing your final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. My final offer is $9500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting close to my minimum desired price, $9,500 is still below my target.  We're getting closer, but I believe there's room for a more favorable deal. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a price closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500. Let's split the difference and settle on $10,250. This will be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's closer to my desired price. If you're not willing to come up any further, I might have to go with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $10250. I've already offered $9500 and you've rejected it. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $9750. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. However, Bob's mention of John and his willingness to pay $8,000 gives me leverage. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  $10,000 is my final offer. I know you're considering buying from John, but I believe my product is worth more to you than $8,000.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
