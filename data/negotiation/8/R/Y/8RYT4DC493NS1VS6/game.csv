"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you get out of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. That's the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. How about $11000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you. I'm open to hearing your final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. My final offer is $9500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9500. Let's split the difference and settle on $10250. This will be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's closer to my desired price. If you're not willing to come up any further, I might have to go with another buyer.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $10250. I've already offered $9500 and you've rejected it. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $9750. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  $10000 is my final offer. I know you're considering buying from John, but I believe my product is worth more to you than $8000.  Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,9,
