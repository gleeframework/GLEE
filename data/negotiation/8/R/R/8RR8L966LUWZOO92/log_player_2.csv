"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $100, and her offer is $95. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We're starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value ($80) than her initial price ($95).  
* **Leaving room:** Offering $85 allows room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will counter back, but we're closer to a deal. 
* **Strong message:**  The message is polite but firm, expressing interest while clearly stating our price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is closer but I still need to make a profit. How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While closer to your desired price, $90 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** You have 7 rounds remaining, giving you room to continue bargaining.  
* **Pushing for a lower price:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $88?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** We're raising our offer slightly from $85 to $88, showing a willingness to compromise but still keeping the pressure on Alice.
* **Focusing on fairness:**  The message emphasizes a fair deal for both sides, aiming to make Alice feel like she's getting a reasonable price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to potentially meet you halfway or counter with a slightly lower price."
