"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good deal.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as I'm willing to sell to John for $120 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still below my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not giving in too easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $115 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get $120 by continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob keeps refusing to meet my minimum price, and we're running out of time.  I'm going to sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose money."
