Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $750,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I still need to consider my options carefully. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I know I can get a better deal if I can get him to meet me in the middle. I'll decide to reject his offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob $720,000, which is $60,000 higher than his offer. This should be a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to him.
