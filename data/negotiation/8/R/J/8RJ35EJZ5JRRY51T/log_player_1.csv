I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and maximizes my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to make a sale, I cannot accept such a low price. I will counter with a new offer in the next round."

I'm lowering my price from the previous offer, but still keeping it above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while maintaining my position."
