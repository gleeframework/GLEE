"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product.  I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  My asking price is $1,150,000. This reflects the unique value it offers, while still allowing room for negotiation.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1,050,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and what I am willing to pay.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. This still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still interested in working with you, but $1,075,000 is still too far from what I need to accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,090,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach a final agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we are getting closer to a deal. While I appreciate your offer, $1,085,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a final compromise.
