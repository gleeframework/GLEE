"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some leverage and allows for a potential middle ground.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  My message is friendly and invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it shows he's willing to negotiate. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer maintains my position of power and keeps the possibility of a higher price open. 
* **Avoid Selling to John:** Selling to John would be a loss for me. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $11,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a good compromise.  Let's try to find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my offer, but not by much. This demonstrates a willingness to work with Bob without sacrificing too much.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired outcome. 
* **Opportunity for More:** I'm confident that I can still get a better price with further negotiation. There's still room to move before resorting to selling to John.
* **Maintain Control:**  Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to make a counteroffer that could secure a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $11,750 is definitely moving in the right direction. However, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm reducing my price slightly to demonstrate flexibility and signal a willingness to reach a deal.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Losing Deal:** While I'm getting closer to his price, there's a risk of reaching an impasse and potentially losing the deal altogether.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I can still push for a higher price. It also shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,600 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Limited Time:** We are already in round 8, and there are only two rounds left. There's a high risk of not reaching a deal and getting stuck with the product.
* **Secure Income:** Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale and ensures I don't lose money.  While it's not ideal, it's the best option considering the circumstances.

I'm taking a calculated risk by selling to John.  However, I'm choosing to prioritize securing a sale and ensuring I don't lose money on this deal."
