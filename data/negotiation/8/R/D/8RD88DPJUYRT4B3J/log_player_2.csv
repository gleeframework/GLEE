"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $13,500. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are 9 more rounds, and you can try to get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** While $15,000 is your limit, you don't want to buy immediately from John as you might get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** It creates space for further negotiation in the remaining rounds. 
* **Maximizes potential savings:**  If successful, this counteroffer will save you $1,000 compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While closer to your ideal price, it's still above your preferred range. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There are 7 rounds left to explore.
* **John's offer remains a safe option:** If you can't get a better deal with Alice, you have the backup option of purchasing from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. 
* **Moving closer:**  This shows Alice you're willing to negotiate and are getting closer to her price point.
* **Minimizing risk:**  If accepted, this saves you $500 compared to Alice's latest offer.
* **Room for more negotiation:**  There are still 6 rounds remaining to potentially get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer is only $800 above your desired price, making it a good deal.
* **Limited time:** There are only 5 rounds left, and further negotiation might not yield significantly better results.
* **Avoiding John's higher price:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,200 compared to buying from John.

While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing a good deal outweighs the potential for small additional savings."
