"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $13,500}

I'm starting with a moderate offer that's slightly higher than my minimum price of $12,000, but still reasonable given the product's value to Bob. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,500 because it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'd rather wait for a better offer or make a counteroffer to try to get a higher price. Selling to John for $12,000 is not an attractive option at this point, as I'd be leaving money on the table. Let's see what Bob's next move is!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $14,000}

I'm making a counteroffer of $14,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's previous offer and closer to the product's value to him. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price for Bob and we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $13,000 because it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price, so I'll keep negotiating with Bob to try to get a better offer. Selling to John for $12,000 is not an attractive option at this point, as I'd be leaving money on the table. Let's see what Bob's next move is!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $13,800}

I'm making a counteroffer of $13,800, which is slightly higher than Bob's previous offer and still a bit lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob is willing to meet me in the middle and we can come to an agreement."
