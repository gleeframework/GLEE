Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far beyond what I'm able to spend. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's start there. I'm ready to negotiate further if you're open to it.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it seems unlikely he'll reach a number that makes staying in this negotiation worthwhile. John offers a sure $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than potentially getting less from Bob."
