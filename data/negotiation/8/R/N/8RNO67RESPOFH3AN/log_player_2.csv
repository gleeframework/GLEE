{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price creates a more favorable negotiating position. This forces Alice to consider a significant price drop, increasing the likelihood of a deal at a more advantageous price for Bob."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting and counter-offering again keeps the pressure on Alice and maintains the potential for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my ideal price.  At this point, I'm willing to accept the deal to avoid the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a stalemate or a worse outcome. While there's a chance I could get it lower, the potential gain is not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
