"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true worth.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's value and the market conditions.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
