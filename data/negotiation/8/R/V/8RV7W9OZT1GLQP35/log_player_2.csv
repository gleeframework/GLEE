"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fantastic deal, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. While she's trying to convince you it's worth $12,000, you have a guaranteed option to buy it for $12,000 from John.  You should try to get a better deal from Alice."
