Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win situation:
    * **For Bob:** He gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him ($1,000,000).
    * **For Alice:** You make a $150,000 profit, which is more than the guaranteed $200,000 profit from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  

This approach balances profit maximization with the understanding that Bob needs an incentive to buy from you instead of you going with your guaranteed sale to John."
