Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is already a very good price for a product worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
