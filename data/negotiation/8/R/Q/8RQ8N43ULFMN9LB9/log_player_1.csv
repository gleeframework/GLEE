{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is above Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to earn a significant profit while keeping the deal attractive to Bob.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It encourages a positive response and sets a tone for a constructive negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $12,000 is a good starting point, leaving space to negotiate higher.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** By offering a price that's attractive but not too low, I keep Bob interested in the deal.
* **Protect my minimum value:** This price is well above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and continue to negotiate, always keeping John's offer of $15,000 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  It's also well below the initial offer I made.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer.  This allows me to:

* **Maintain my desired profit:** I won't settle for a price that drastically undervalues the product.
* **Explore potential negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I can hopefully reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to a fair deal and maintain leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. My goal is to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us, while still maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $5,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling it for $9,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  My counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer but still below my original offer of $12,000. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.  It also acknowledges his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to:
    * **Maintain Profitability:** $9,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired profit. 
    * **Show Flexibility:**  By compromising, I signal willingness to reach a deal.
    * **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  This counteroffer maintains momentum and avoids a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  I've secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $6,500 is an improvement from his initial $5,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and my initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would lead to a significant loss and wouldn't reflect the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't accept a price that severely undervalues the product.  By rejecting this offer, I:

* **Maintain my position:** I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my desired profit.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  This approach maintains the opportunity to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Preserve the option to sell to John:** John is still a viable alternative, and his offer remains my safety net.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground between Bob's current offer and my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $6,500 is still too low. To make this work, how about we split the difference at $8,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good price. Let's try to finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counteroffer of $8,000 is the midpoint between Bob's current offer of $6,500 and my previous offer of $9,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find a compromise.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It also acknowledges his previous offer and focuses on reaching a final agreement.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * **Maintain Profitability:** $8,000 is closer to my desired profit margin while still being a good deal for Bob.
    * **Signal Compromise:**  By splitting the difference, I show a genuine willingness to compromise and reach a mutually acceptable outcome.
    * **Increase Pressure:**  This offer is the last step before I move to selling to John, adding pressure to Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've achieved a satisfactory outcome and secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll have to decide whether to accept his final offer or move on to John, who is offering my minimum acceptable value."
