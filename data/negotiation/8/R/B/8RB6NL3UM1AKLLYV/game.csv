"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I could consider $2,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. While I understand it's valuable, I need to be realistic about my budget.  I could go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $950,000 is too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000, but that's my best offer. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  I can offer $1,100,000 â€“ it's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are making progress.  Your offer does demonstrate commitment.  While I'm aiming higher, I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000 to try and finalize this.  Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a figure we can both agree on.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000.  I think this represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this, and I respect that.  How about we aim for a win-win?  I'd be willing to accept $1,450,000. This feels like a strong offer, especially with the value this product brings.",1450000.0,Alice,9,
