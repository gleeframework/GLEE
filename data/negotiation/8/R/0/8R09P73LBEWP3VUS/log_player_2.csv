# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by our previous customers. Given its quality and functionality, we believe it's worth more than its actual cost. Considering its value to you, I propose to sell it to you for $95. This price allows us to maintain our business model while ensuring you receive a great deal. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
