"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation.  This allows for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still leaving me room to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

I'm offering a slight compromise by coming down from my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price point that is fair for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $125 as the purchase price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  I'm concerned about running out of negotiation rounds.  I'm going to accept his offer to ensure a sale."
