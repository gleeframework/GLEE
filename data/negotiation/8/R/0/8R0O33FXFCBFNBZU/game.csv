"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $875,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $912,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,7,
