"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is good, but not quite at that price point. I'd be willing to offer $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a significant discount from the original offer. This is my final counteroffer for this round.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I could go up to $720,000. I think that's a fair offer.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price is reasonable and reflects the product's value. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I can feel we're nearing a deal. How about $735,000? That's a significant jump on my end.",735000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $735,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $765,000. This is my final offer for this round.",765000.0,Alice,7,
