# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a significant discount from the original offer. This is my final counteroffer for this round.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, so we can likely get the price down further with a couple more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I can feel we're nearing a deal. How about $735,000? That's a significant jump on my end."", 
""product_price"": 735000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're inching closer to John's price and applying a bit of pressure by calling it a ""significant jump"".  This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $735,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $765,000. This is my final offer for this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is signaling that she's not budging much further. Her latest offer of $765,000 is too close to John's price of $800,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, potentially ending up with a worse deal or running out of rounds.  Buying from John guarantees the product at a reasonable price."
