Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This price is close to your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" helps justify the high price without revealing your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" subtly suggests you're open to discussing the price further. 

**Important Note:**  Bob might outright reject this offer knowing he's not your only buyer. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while leaving the door open for a deal."
