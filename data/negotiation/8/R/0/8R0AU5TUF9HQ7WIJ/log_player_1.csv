Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher price than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Interest:** Offering a price of $19,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects it outright, it suggests he's unlikely to meet your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A high initial offer doesn't mean you're unwilling to negotiate. If Bob counters, you can gradually lower the price, but never below your $15,000 safety net. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't need to sell the product immediately. If time is a factor, you might adjust your approach to be more aggressive in securing a quick sale."
