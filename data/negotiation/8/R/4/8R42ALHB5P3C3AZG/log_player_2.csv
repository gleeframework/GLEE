"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering the value of the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to get as close to Alice's valuation as possible without exceeding his own limit. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate without compromising too much on her end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than buying from John, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows him to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is closer to my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget.  This counteroffer is closer to Alice's offer, making it more likely she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth.  $10,900 is my final offer. It's a great deal for something of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice's offer is $100 lower than John's offer, which is significant.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation going on too long.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal within his budget and minimizes the risk of losing out on the product."
