"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $9,000. Let me know if this is within your consideration.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would still be a great price for you, considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've looked into the situation further and I'm willing to offer $9,200 for the product. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford, given my budget constraints. I hope this meets your needs.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,400? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your proposal. I am willing to consider $9,300 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford without exceeding my budget. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",9300.0,Bob,6,
