Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is fair given its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet halfway between our last offers, at $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price. It makes more financial sense to sell to John at my desired price than to continue negotiating with Bob."
