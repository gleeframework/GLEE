"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's way above his target price of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as he has a good chance of getting a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still above his limit. He can continue negotiating, potentially getting closer to his desired $1,000,000."
