{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still reflects the value of the product to Bob.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to $15,000 but I'm also prepared to potentially accept a lower offer, or to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob, so I'll proceed with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to accept that offer yet. I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $13,000,  $11,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and it avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
