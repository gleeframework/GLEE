# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

This seems like a good point to accept. Alice is signaling this is her final offer and the price difference at this stage is getting smaller. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significant savings."
