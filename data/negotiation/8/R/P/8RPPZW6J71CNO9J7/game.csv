"Thank you for the offer, Alice. $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I have to consider the true value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
