"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  How about $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $800,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
