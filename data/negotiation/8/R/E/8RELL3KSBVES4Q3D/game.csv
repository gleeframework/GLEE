"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate, but $110 is a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $95. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product without breaking my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
