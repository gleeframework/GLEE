"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice. $110 is still a bit higher than what the product is worth to you. You can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate, but $110 is a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $95. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to save as much money as possible, and $105 is still a little higher than your ideal price. You can make another counteroffer and see if you can get Alice to come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product without breaking my budget."", ""product_price"": 100}
