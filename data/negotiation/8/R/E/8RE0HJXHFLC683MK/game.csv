"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value you place on the product at $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer you $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a generous offer, the product's value is substantial. To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and your own valuation of the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that will benefit both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
