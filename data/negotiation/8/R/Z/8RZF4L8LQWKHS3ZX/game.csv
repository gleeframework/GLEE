"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's on offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
