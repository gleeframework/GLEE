"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to let the product go for $20000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $21500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to prioritize my own interests as well.",21500.0,Alice,5,
