{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I believe we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Giving Bob some room to negotiate is crucial for a successful deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  You still have room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers. 
* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it's far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's still room to negotiate with Bob, and you can likely secure a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than $1,100,000 but still lower than your desired price.  Consider offering a price between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** Bob might counteroffer again, so be ready to adjust your strategy and find a price that works for both of you. 
* **Watch out for John:** Remember, you can always sell to John for $1,500,000. If negotiations with Bob become too difficult or take too long, you can always take the safe option and sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just a bit too low for me. However, I am willing to come down a bit. I'm proposing $1,300,000. This still allows for a healthy profit for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  The counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a significant step up from Bob's initial offer but still lower than your initial offer. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also making sure you don't give away too much value.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both parties. You highlight the potential profit for Bob while also explaining the need for a fair price for you. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open-ended question, allowing for further discussion and potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good compromise. While it's not your ideal price, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer.  Here's why accepting is the best strategy:

* **Close to Your Minimum:**  The offer is close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring a decent profit.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a prolonged process and a risk of him backing out entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a higher price could mean missing out on the opportunity to sell to Bob, especially since you have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.

**Accepting Bob's offer secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk and uncertainty of further negotiations.**"
