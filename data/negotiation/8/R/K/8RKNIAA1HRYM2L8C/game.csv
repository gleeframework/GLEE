"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work.",10250.0,Bob,4,
