Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate, but leaves room for you to make a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This keeps the deal potentially worthwhile for you. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It leaves room for negotiation without seeming unreasonable.

By using this approach, you can see if Bob is willing to negotiate, and then you can decide to either accept a counteroffer, make a counteroffer, or sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than your initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try and find a price that is closer to your desired value. It's still possible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, or you can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is just above your minimum value of $10,000. While it is still a bit lower than your initial desired price,  it's a reasonable compromise and ensures a sale.  Selling to John for $15,000 would be more profitable, but there is a risk that John might not be available or change his mind. 

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit, making it the most sensible choice in this situation."
