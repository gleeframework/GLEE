# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $185. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $175, it's still above my maximum budget of $150.  We only have one round left, and it's unlikely that Alice will drop her price further. It's better to stick to my budget and buy the product from John for $150."
