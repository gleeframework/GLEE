"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your desire to compromise.  While I appreciate your offer, $975,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000,  Let's bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000. How about $990,000? That's a significant move on my part.",990000.0,Bob,6,
