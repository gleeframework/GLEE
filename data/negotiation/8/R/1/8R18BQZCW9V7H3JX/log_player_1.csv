"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and can potentially secure a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a backup option:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Although it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept as I'm confident I can secure a better deal.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I have multiple rounds remaining to work with Bob and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Selling to John is a safe fallback:** While I'm aiming for a better price, John's offer is a secure backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to compromise.  While I appreciate your offer, $975,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000,  Let's bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000. How about $990,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though he's moved closer to my price, he's still not willing to meet my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** I'm running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee that I can secure a better price with Bob.
* **Secure deal with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price."
