"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider $8500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you, while also allowing me to make a fair profit.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8750? This would give us both a fair price. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8750 is still below my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,5,
