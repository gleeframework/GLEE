"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's less than your maximum, there's a lot of room for negotiation. 
* **There are 10 rounds.** You have time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  He's offering the product at your maximum price, so you only want to go to him if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  I'm starting with a low counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.
* **Below Alice's value:**  $700,000 is still above Alice's value, giving her a reason to negotiate.
* **Room for compromise:** This gives us a good starting point for negotiation, with potential for a price somewhere in between."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While lower than the previous round, it's still significantly above what I'd like to pay.
* **Negotiation is ongoing.**  We're only in round 3, and there's still room for a more favorable price. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** I'm committed to getting the best possible deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Mid-point negotiation:** This offer is halfway between my last offer and Alice's current offer, signaling that I'm trying to find a middle ground.
* **Leaving room for more negotiation:**  There's still room for Alice to come down a bit more, but this shows I'm serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, and we're getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Risk of escalation:**  If I reject and counteroffer again, there's a chance Alice might get stubborn or the negotiation could drag on. 
* **Good value for the product:** $850,000 is still a good deal, considering the product's worth to me and the potential for a longer, riskier negotiation."
