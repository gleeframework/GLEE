"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10000? It's a fair compromise and a price that would allow me to move forward with the sale.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9000.  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a middle ground. While I value your willingness to compromise, $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9500. This price is a fair compromise and would allow us both to finalize the transaction. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,
