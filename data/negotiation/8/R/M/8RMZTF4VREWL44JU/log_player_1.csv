``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value of $15,000 but acknowledging that Bob's value is lower. By offering a price that is above Bob's value but below mine, I'm creating an opportunity for negotiation and potentially reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While I want to reach a deal, I'm not willing to sell the product at a price that undervalues it. By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to find a more suitable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,000? It's a fair compromise and a price that would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9000.  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still lower than my desired price. I'm confident that I can reach a more profitable agreement with Bob or sell to John for a much higher price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a middle ground. While I value your willingness to compromise, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. This price is a fair compromise and would allow us both to finalize the transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
