Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and showing genuine interest. While $1,600,000 is a strong starting point, the value this product brings to the table, particularly in terms of its long-term benefits,  is considerably higher. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product and presents a fair deal for both of us.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
