"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're starting with an ambitious offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high initial price. We want Bob to think about the potential upside. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception. 

This strategy sets the stage for a negotiation where we can strategically concede while aiming for a final price that is much closer to our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant jump from his initial perceived value, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate, and selling to John right now would mean missing out on a potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and showing genuine interest. While $1,600,000 is a strong starting point, the value this product brings to the table, particularly in terms of its long-term benefits,  is considerably higher. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product and presents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** We start by acknowledging Bob's offer and thanking him for his interest. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Justification for a Higher Price:** We re-emphasize the product's value, focusing on its ""long-term benefits,"" to justify a price higher than Bob's offer.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** Our counteroffer of $1,900,000 is a significant drop from our previous price but still keeps us comfortably above our minimum and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  By using phrases like ""finding middle ground"" and ""fair deal for both of us,"" we signal our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is now below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will be willing to increase his offer significantly. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away from the deal altogether."
