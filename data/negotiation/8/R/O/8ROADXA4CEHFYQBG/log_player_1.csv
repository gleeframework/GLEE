Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal, given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, making it a potentially attractive deal for him.  By leaving room for negotiation, I can maximize my potential earnings while still maintaining a strong chance of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I'd prefer more, accepting $8,750 is a good compromise. It's a decent profit and avoids further negotiation that might risk losing the sale altogether."
