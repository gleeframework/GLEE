Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to $1,200,000 without scaring Bob away. Offering something slightly below his perceived value could make him feel like he's getting a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a $150,000 profit margin, significantly more than your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 
* **Reasoning:** By pricing slightly below Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, you increase the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a substantial profit.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,150,000. He might try to negotiate further.  You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or risk losing the sale to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
