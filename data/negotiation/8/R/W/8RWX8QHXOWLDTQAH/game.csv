"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $800000. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
