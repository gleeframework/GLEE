Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. It seems we're both serious about making a deal.  I could go up to $750,000.  That's a strong offer, and I think it's fair considering the market value.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to meet my minimum price of $1,000,000. He's incrementing his offers in small amounts, and we're still $250,000 apart.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
