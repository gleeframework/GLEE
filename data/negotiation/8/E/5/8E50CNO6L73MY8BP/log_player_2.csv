"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.**  
* **Bob can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within his budget.**

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob to save money."
