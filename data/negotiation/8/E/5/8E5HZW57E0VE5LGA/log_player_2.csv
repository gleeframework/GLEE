"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget. You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for a lower price. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have the option to buy from John for a lower price, and you have more rounds to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,075,000 is still above my target price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This reflects a significant move towards your offer while staying within my budget. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay, and you've already reached the middle ground in previous rounds. At this point, you've only got 5 rounds left, and you're likely to end up paying more than John's price. It's more beneficial to buy from John at a guaranteed lower price."
