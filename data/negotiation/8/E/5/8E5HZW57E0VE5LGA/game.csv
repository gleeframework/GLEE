"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,075,000 is still above my target price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This reflects a significant move towards your offer while staying within my budget. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
