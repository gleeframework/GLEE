{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate a bit. This leaves room for us to find a price we both can agree on. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $120 if I need to, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a fair price, and it gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still lower than my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise."
