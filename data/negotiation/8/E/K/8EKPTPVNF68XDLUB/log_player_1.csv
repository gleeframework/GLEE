"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the high price by emphasizing the product's ""true value and potential,"" subtly suggesting that Bob might be undervaluing it. 
* **Alternative:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000. This gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting would be a substantial loss.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but $750,000 is significantly below its worth. Let's find a compromise. How about $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Still Above Minimum:**  I've dropped the price by $300,000, signaling flexibility. However, I'm still well above both my $1,500,000 minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  My message focuses on finding a mutually agreeable solution, encouraging Bob to engage in more meaningful negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:**  While I have time, I'm aware that each round brings Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I need to balance concessions with maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep. How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. It's too early to accept an offer this far from my target. I'll counteroffer again, attempting to draw him closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a compromise. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant jump down to $1,450,000. This brings me close to my absolute minimum while still leaving a small buffer for potential further negotiation.
* **Signaling Finality:**  My message emphasizes that this is a substantial concession and demonstrates my strong desire to finalize the deal. 
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm applying gentle pressure by highlighting the value of a quick agreement.  
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't meet me near this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,225,000 is still a significant amount away from my $1,500,000 minimum. I need to hold strong and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my range. I'll counter-offer again, but I'm also keenly aware that John's offer is looking increasingly attractive as time goes on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To demonstrate my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm lowering the price by $100,000, showing movement but not too much. This keeps the pressure on Bob to make a significant move.
* **Focus on Fairness:** By emphasizing fairness, I'm subtly reminding Bob that his offer is still considerably below both his own perceived value and my previous concessions.
* **Sense of Urgency:** With only four rounds remaining, my message implies that time is running out to reach a deal. 
* **John's Offer in Mind:**  While I'm still trying to negotiate the best price from Bob, John's standing offer adds significant weight to my position. I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet me closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still too low, and with only two rounds left, it's highly unlikely he'll reach my $1,500,000 minimum.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or dragging out the negotiation further, it makes the most business sense to accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
