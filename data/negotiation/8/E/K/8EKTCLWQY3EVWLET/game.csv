"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the features and the guarantee, $200 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, given its value to me. Would you be open to negotiating closer to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to sell the product to you for $120, which includes all the features you're interested in and still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100.  This would allow me to purchase the product while still staying within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
