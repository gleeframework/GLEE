"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value this product holds for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
