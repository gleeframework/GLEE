Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Not Too High:**  I'm also aware that Bob might reject this offer and I want to keep the negotiations going. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  I'm not going to go below $150, as I have a guaranteed sale to John at that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $150.** I want to maximize my profit and selling to John for $150 is still on the table. 
* **There is room for negotiation.** Bob has shown interest and is willing to go up from his initial value.  

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $135 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous price of $135 and Bob's offer of $125. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $130 is still above my minimum value of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm not going too low, as I can still sell to John for $150 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $150.**  
* **I've already made concessions.**  I've gone down from $135 to $130, and I don't want to keep going lower.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit.** Selling to John for $150 is the most profitable option at this point. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price."
