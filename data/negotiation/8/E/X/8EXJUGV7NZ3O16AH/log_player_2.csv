It seems like Alice is stuck and not willing to budge below $10,500.  At this point, you're only saving $500 compared to John's offer. It's not worth the risk of Alice increasing her price again or the time spent on further negotiation.  Buying from John for $15,000 guarantees you get the product without further hassle."
