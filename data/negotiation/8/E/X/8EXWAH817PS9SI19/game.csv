"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,100,000 for the product. This price still leaves room for you to make a good profit, and it's fair to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,075,000 still doesn't meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. I propose $1,090,000. This price is fair to both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
