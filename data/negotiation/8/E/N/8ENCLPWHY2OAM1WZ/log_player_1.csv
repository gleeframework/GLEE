Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation but ensures I don't leave too much money on the table. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer gives Bob an incentive to negotiate as he can still save money.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer, but my goal is to maximize profit, not just secure the minimum sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting it would mean leaving $150,000 on the table compared to my initial ask. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I acknowledge your budget considerations,  the value this product brings to your specific needs remains significant.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($1,200,000) and my previous ask ($1,350,000). 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's unique value to him, justifying a price above his initial proposal. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,225,000 is a reasonable compromise. While I could push for more, the difference is now relatively small ($50,000). Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit ($225,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate.  It's time to close the deal."
