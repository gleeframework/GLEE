Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is 20% higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit, while also potentially incentivizing Bob to counteroffer.  I'll then be ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  I'm going to reject it. I am confident I can negotiate a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a significant profit. It's also a good starting point for potential further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I'm confident that John is a safe bet for a guaranteed $1,000,000. I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
