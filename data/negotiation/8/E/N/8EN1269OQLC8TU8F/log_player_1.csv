Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, potentially justifying a price above his perceived value.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always come down to $1,500,000 if needed, ensuring you don't lose money. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about Bob's needs and negotiating dynamically would be beneficial."
