Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,100,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and encouraging message increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer or engaging in further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob can make the offer more appealing.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option, which gives me leverage in case Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950000. This price is still within your desired range and would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $950,000 is within my desired range, it's significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction this early in the negotiation.
* **Leverage John:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me strong leverage. I can use this as a bargaining chip to push Bob higher.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $950,000 and $1,100,000, potentially starting around $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price still represents a great value for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value for Bob to encourage him to see the offer as a good deal.
* **Setting a Clear Deadline:** I'm not explicitly setting a deadline, but I'm hinting that I may not be willing to negotiate much lower, leaving the impression that this is a good opportunity. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still keeping John as a fallback option, which gives me leverage in case Bob rejects this offer again."
