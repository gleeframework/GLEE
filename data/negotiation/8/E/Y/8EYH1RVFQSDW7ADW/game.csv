"I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $16000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with a price of $17500. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with a price of $16750. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",16750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $16750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'll counter with a price of $18250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",18250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I was expecting you to walk away. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'll counter with a price of $18000, which is the same as my initial offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",18000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to lose patience, Bob. I've made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make one final offer: $18500. This is my absolute walk-away price, and I expect you to accept it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",18500.0,Alice,9,
