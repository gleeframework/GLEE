Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us.

While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, there's still some room to negotiate. I'm going to counter again and try to get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $882,500, which is just $2,500 above my minimum price.

Alice's offer of $882,500 is very close to my target price of $850,000 and is a much better deal than buying from John. It's worth accepting at this point to secure the product."
