"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I value the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer $875,000 for the product. This price is fair and gives us both a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $882,500, which is just $2,500 above my minimum price. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us.",882500.0,Alice,5,
