"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,400,000 at this point.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm eager to find a deal, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
