"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but unfortunately, $12,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $13,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment. ",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $13,500 is still slightly out of my range, I appreciate the flexibility. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,500? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring a valuable product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum price point, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. Would you consider $13,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal.  ",13000.0,Alice,5,
