Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and the potential for a good deal, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  This leaves room to adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John's offer of $15,000 provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While I'm not willing to accept his offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired amount.
* **John's Offer:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 provides me with a strong backup option, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but unfortunately, $12,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $13,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is still higher than Bob's offer but significantly closer to his budget, indicating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that this offer is a good deal for both of us.
* **Opportunity to Close:**  By proposing $13,500, I am hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price point and close the deal. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still confident in John's offer of $15,000, which gives me the freedom to be more flexible without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $13,500 is still slightly out of my range, I appreciate the flexibility. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,500? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring a valuable product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price point, his offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to bridge the remaining gap.
* **John's Offer:**  With John's offer of $15,000, I have a strong safety net. This gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob, as I'm not under pressure to accept an offer below my minimum.

I will proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum price point, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. Would you consider $13,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal.  "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm offering a final concession of $13,000, which is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is intended to bridge the remaining gap and create a more palatable price for Bob.
* **Fair Deal Emphasis:** I'm framing this as a fair deal for both parties, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  With John's offer of $15,000, I can afford to be more flexible without feeling pressured to accept a price that is significantly lower than my minimum.

I believe this final counteroffer presents a reasonable price point that Bob is likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. Considering the value of the product and staying within my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $12,800. This would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $12,800 is still just above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** I've already made significant concessions, and there's limited room for further negotiation without risking a loss. 
* **John's Offer:**  With John's offer of $15,000 on the table, it makes sense to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  John's offer guarantees a higher profit and provides a more secure outcome. 

By selling to John, I ensure a more favorable price and avoid the potential for a protracted negotiation that might not yield a satisfactory result."
