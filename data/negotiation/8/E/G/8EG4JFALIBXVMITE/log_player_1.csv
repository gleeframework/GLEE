"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy, but for now, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'm hoping for a higher price and have 9 more rounds to work with.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price by $200,000, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This should encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm willing to take a few more rounds to see if I can reach a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time by a smaller amount. I'm showing that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than it's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is tempting, we're getting close to my minimum. However, I still have 4 rounds left and believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is my last counteroffer before considering selling to John.  I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also giving Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing out on a better deal. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so I'll take that option."
