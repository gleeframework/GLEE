"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still allows me to make a profit. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
