"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to buy it for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher than $110.  Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I hear you.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $115?  That's a good compromise, and we can both be happy with that price.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit too high.  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement, but I'm only willing to pay $110.  Let's split the difference and call it a day.",110.0,Bob,6,
