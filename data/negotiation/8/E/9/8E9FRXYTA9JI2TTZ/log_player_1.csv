Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down while still securing a price well above your guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value specifically to Bob (""your expertise"") might make him more receptive to the high initial price."
