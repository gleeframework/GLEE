Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. She knows Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Attractive but Realistic:** The price is attractive to Bob (potentially saving him $50,000 compared to its value to him) while still netting Alice a significant profit above her minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't miss out on a guaranteed sale."
