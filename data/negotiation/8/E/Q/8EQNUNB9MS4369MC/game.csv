"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $145?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Can you consider my revised offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's see if we can find a happy medium. I'm willing to drop my price to $140. This is my final offer, as I'm already below my minimum acceptable price.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.  Let's settle on $137.50. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're agreeable to this final offer.",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",132.0,Bob,8,
