"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $12,000 at this point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, hoping to quickly establish a lower price point. $12,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget.  This aggressive move might encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $13,000 is closer to his target, he has more rounds to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, he can continue to try and push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm ready to close the deal at $12,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer.  Offering $12,500 positions him in the middle ground, suggesting a genuine effort to reach a deal. This strategy aims to make Alice feel like she's getting a good outcome, increasing the chances of her accepting."
