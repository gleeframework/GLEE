"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You are trying to save as much money as possible.
* Accepting Alice's offer for $9,500 would mean paying more than the product's worth to you ($10,000).
* Buying from John for $10,000 is also not ideal as it's your maximum budget.
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially getting a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice is still asking for a price higher than the product's worth to you.
* Buying from John for $10,000 is still not the best option as it's your maximum budget.
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to lower the price further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While Alice's offer of $9,600 is still higher than the product's worth to you, it's closer to your maximum budget than John's offer.
* Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice might walk away, leaving you with only John's option.
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
