Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum value. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again, but I will need to be more flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again to $12,500. This is a compromise, as it's just above my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum value, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will result in a higher price. To avoid the risk of further price reductions, I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000. This guarantees me a profit and saves time on potentially unproductive negotiations."
