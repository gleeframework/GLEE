"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This will give us room to negotiate and hopefully end up with a price that's closer to my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm aiming to get a good deal while keeping open the option to sell to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, as it's significantly below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still keeping it well above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go too low yet. I believe we can find a mutually acceptable price between $1,400,000 and $800,000 in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  We are getting closer to a deal, so it's worth continuing to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,200,000. This is a significant drop, but I believe it's still a fair price considering my minimum and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to get Bob to agree and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a slightly better price. I'm not ready to sell for $1,100,000 yet.  We've only got 4 rounds left, so I need to be strategic about my offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000.  This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to finally get Bob to agree, as we're running out of rounds. If he rejects this, I may have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire and I'm not confident I can get Bob to budge. He's stuck at $1,100,000, which is still below my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not the highest price, it's still a good deal and ensures I meet my minimum goal."
