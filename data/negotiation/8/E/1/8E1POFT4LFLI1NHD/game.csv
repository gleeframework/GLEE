"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of this unique product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $975,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and your budget. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. How about $950,000? I think that's the maximum I can stretch to, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
