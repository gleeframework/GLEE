Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.  She knows Bob won't pay more than that, and she has a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John.

**The Strategy:**  Alice should start with an offer slightly below Bob's maximum price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring Bob sees a potential deal.

**The Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,175,000.  I'm confident we can find an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Why this approach?**

* **Strong opening:** The message is positive and emphasizes mutual benefit.
* **Strategic pricing:** The price is attractive to Bob while still leaving room for Alice to potentially negotiate upwards. 
* **Alternative in mind:** Alice knows if Bob rejects this offer, she has a guaranteed sale to John. This gives her leverage in the negotiation."
