"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I still believe $10,000 is a reasonable price. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 just doesn't work for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's close the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
