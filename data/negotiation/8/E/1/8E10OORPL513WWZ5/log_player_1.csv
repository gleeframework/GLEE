Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:**  This is a compromise offer, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 just doesn't work for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but still above Bob's last offer. It keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a price that is closer to my desired range.
* **Message:** The message is assertive, clearly stating my position while still being respectful. It emphasizes the value of the product and frames the offer as a solution that benefits both parties."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $11,000 as the price for the product. This is a fair compromise between the value you place on it and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what John is offering. I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are minimal, and the risk of continuing is too high. It's more advantageous for me to sell to John at this point and secure the higher price."
