{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial profit.
* The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for both of us. 
* It sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I'd like to exhaust negotiation with Bob first."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer and above my minimum value. 
* **Message:**  The message is positive and reinforces the value proposition for Bob while emphasizing my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for continued negotiation while keeping me in a favorable position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay firm on my minimum price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a good option, but I want to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob before resorting to that."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to find a solution, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a price that reflects both the value of the product and our need to find a mutually agreeable solution.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and his offer of $950,000. It's also still significantly higher than his perceived value but within my minimum acceptable range.
* **Message:** The message is firm but also positive, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob and the need for a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm presenting this as my final offer, hoping to close the deal without further negotiation. However, if Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept his final offer to avoid further delays."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, it seems we've reached an impasse.  Rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially losing out on more valuable offers, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get the best possible price for my product."
