"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter. $1,400,000 is still a little steep for me. I could go up to $1,000,000. That's the absolute highest I can go. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
