"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $112.50. This way we both get a fair price, and I can move on to the next deal.  What do you say?",112.5,Alice,3,
