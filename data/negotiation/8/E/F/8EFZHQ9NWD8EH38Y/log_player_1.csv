Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's worth.
* **Gauge Interest:** The high price will gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, you can always lower the price or walk away knowing John provides a safety net. 
* **Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the $12,000, you make a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind Bob will likely try to negotiate down from the $12,000. Be prepared to adjust your price, but never go below your $10,000 minimum.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower initial offer."
