"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not aiming for the maximum price right away, as I want to give Bob a chance to counter and potentially find a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds.
* **The importance of John:** Knowing I have a fallback option with John for $1,000,000 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response (whether he accepts or counters) to determine my next move. 
* If Bob counters, I'll need to assess his counteroffer against my minimum value and John's offer. 
* Each round will be a strategic decision based on Bob's actions and my desire to maximize profit while maintaining a chance of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my starting point:** While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still lower than my initial offer of $1,500,000. This shows that there's room for further negotiation and potential to reach a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 8 rounds remaining, I can afford to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm committed to getting a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer. This will show him that I'm willing to negotiate but that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my initial asking price.
* I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and my remaining time to determine my next move. 
* My goal is to continue moving towards a price that is closer to my desired outcome while ensuring that I don't run out of time or end up accepting a price that is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  I'm reducing my offer to $1,400,000, showing a willingness to compromise. However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my initial asking price.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  I'm not willing to settle for Bob's low offer, but I'm also not being too aggressive. This keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position.
* **Strategic use of rounds:**  We've already had two rounds, and there are still 8 rounds left. This gives me the flexibility to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll be very attentive to Bob's response. If he accepts, that's a good outcome.
* If he counters, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or make a new counteroffer.
* My goal is to maximize profit while leaving room for compromise and ensuring a deal is made before time runs out."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price:**  While I'm open to negotiating, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not a good deal considering the remaining time.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to stand firm on my price. 
* **Time is on my side:**  We've had four rounds, leaving six more rounds to reach a more favorable agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that is slightly higher than his offer but still lower than my last offer. 
*  I'll aim to bridge the gap while demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* My goal is to reach a price that is mutually agreeable while ensuring a deal is made within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer by reducing my price to $1,250,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Strategic compromise:** This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but it shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Time pressure:**  We're now halfway through the rounds, so I need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of running out of time.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll closely monitor Bob's response.  
* If he accepts, we have a deal.
* If he counters, I'll assess his offer based on the remaining rounds and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* My goal is to close the deal with the best possible price, while considering the remaining time and the risk of losing the deal altogether."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're at Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining. This is a crucial point where the pressure to close the deal increases significantly. 
* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While it's not ideal, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **The risk of a counteroffer:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he will counter with a better price. He might simply walk away.  

**Conclusion:**

Considering the time pressure and the potential risk of losing the deal entirely, accepting Bob's offer is the most rational decision. While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good deal for me given the circumstances."
