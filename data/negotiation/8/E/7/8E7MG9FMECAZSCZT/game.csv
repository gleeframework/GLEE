,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can offer you a compromise at $120. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $90. I can meet you halfway between $120 and $90, which is $105. I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",105.0,Alice,5,
