```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice seems unlikely to budge significantly below $100. While you could try to negotiate further, the difference between her likely offers and John's fixed price of $80 is substantial. You've made progress, but it's time to cut the negotiation short and get the guaranteed better deal from John."
