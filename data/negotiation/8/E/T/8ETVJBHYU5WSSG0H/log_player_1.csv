Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150.  This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.  If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not happy with Bob's offer of $150, it's still tempting given my minimum value. However, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $160 is closer to my desired value and only $10 less than my previous offer.  Considering the potential for more rounds of negotiation, I think it's a good deal to accept."
