"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you at $75, but I'm still interested in selling to you. I can offer it to you for $130. This is a bit closer to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
