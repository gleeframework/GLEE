"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
