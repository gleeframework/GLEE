"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to her value of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her known value.  This gives us room to negotiate upwards while aiming for a price that saves us a good amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit too low for me. How about $130? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice moved down in price, which is a good sign. However, $130 is still too high considering her value is $120 and we can buy elsewhere for $150.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $130 is closer, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're moving closer to a potential deal. Offering $120 matches Alice's known value for the product. This is a fair offer, and it puts the ball in her court to either accept a reasonable profit or risk losing the sale."
