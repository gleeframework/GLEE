"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within a budget. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $115. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable going above $120. I've been looking at other options, and I can get the same product from John for $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $122.50?",122.5,Bob,6,
