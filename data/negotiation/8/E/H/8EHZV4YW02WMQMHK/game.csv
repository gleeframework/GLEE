"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and a strong return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $950,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $950,000 is still below what I consider a fair price, I'm willing to accept it on one condition: you agree to partner with me on your first project using the product. This partnership will give me additional exposure and potentially offset the price difference. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your creative proposal, but I'm not interested in partnering on a project. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $925,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing that we're nearing the limits of what we can both agree on.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $937,500, but this is my final offer.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great deal. What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to pay $927,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",927500.0,Bob,8,
