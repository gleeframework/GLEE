**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently refusing to budge beyond small increments and is still significantly below a price that reflects the product's value to you.  While $927,500 isn't a terrible price, you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
