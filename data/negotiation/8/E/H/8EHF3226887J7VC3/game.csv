"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1200000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
