Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a high price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the value of the product to Bob, making him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** I state that I'm open to negotiation, showing that I'm willing to find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While I'm aiming for a better price from Bob, I'm also aware that John is a backup option at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.  I can likely get a better price by countering and showing I'm serious about a deal.
* **John's Offer:** I still have John's offer as a backup option. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** My counteroffer is firmly above my minimum but significantly below Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also serious about getting a fair price.
* **Focus on Value:** I reemphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Flexibility:** I suggest ""finding common ground"" to encourage further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Control:** This counteroffer gives me leverage. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **No Significant Improvement:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's not a substantial enough increase to justify further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum and a safer option than continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get more than $1,000,000,  the risk of further negotiation with Bob doesn't outweigh the certainty of John's offer."
