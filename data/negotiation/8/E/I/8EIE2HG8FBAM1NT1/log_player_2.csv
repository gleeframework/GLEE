# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm confident you'd find very useful.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you and my need to make a good profit.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
