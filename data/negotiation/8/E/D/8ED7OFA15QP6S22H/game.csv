"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $22000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $20000?",20000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $21000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",21000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $21000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $19500. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",19500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get a bit more than $19500. I can offer it to you for $20500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, Bob.",20500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $20500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'll need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'll offer $19250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",19250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not sure I'm willing to make another one. However, I'm willing to try one last time. I can offer it to you for $19750. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not going to go any lower.",19750.0,Alice,9,
