"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer you $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $12500. How about we split the difference and go with $11250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
