"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It aligns perfectly with your company's needs and I'm confident it would deliver significant benefits.  I'm offering it to you for $1,600,000, a price that reflects its true value and potential.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the returns will justify it. Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
