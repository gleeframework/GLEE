"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a deal done quickly. However, I'm prepared to potentially go lower if needed, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I believe there's still potential to secure a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little higher than that. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer. How about we try $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept this offer since it's the best deal I've received so far.  However, I need to be aware that I'm losing some profit, so I'll need to carefully consider how much value I can add for Bob in the future to potentially make up for this."
