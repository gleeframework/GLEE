Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's maximum value, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **Is higher than your minimum:** It ensures you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Is not overly aggressive:** It shows good faith and allows for a smoother negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10500.  This is still a good price for you, considering your value of $10000. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the profit I'm hoping to make. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair price considering your value for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
