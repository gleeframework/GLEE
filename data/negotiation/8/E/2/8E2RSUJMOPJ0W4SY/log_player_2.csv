"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better price by negotiating further. Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum:** Bob's maximum is $12,000, and Alice is offering $11,500. 
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room for Bob to negotiate a lower price. He can counteroffer, and Alice might be willing to lower her price to make a deal.
* **John as a backup:** Bob has John as a backup option, ensuring he won't be left without the product if negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This is still a good price for you, considering your value of $10,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** Bob is making a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to Alice's value. This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** Bob emphasizes the product's value to Alice, implying that his offer is still fair to her.
* **Open to negotiation:** Bob's message leaves room for further discussion, indicating his willingness to negotiate a final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair price considering your value for the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Improved price:** Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to negotiate.
* **John's price:**  John is still offering the product for $12,000, making Alice's offer the better option.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without risking further negotiation or paying John's higher price."
