"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $850,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still gives you a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident we can negotiate a bit higher.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $875,000 just isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us finalize this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000 again. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest price I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Okay, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, it's getting late in the negotiations and we've reached a point where further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.  $875,000 is a reasonable price and ensures I secure a sale without risking a counteroffer that might push the price lower or lead to a stalemate."
