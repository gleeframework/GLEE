Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Offering $12,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This offer ensures you're making a profit and not selling below your minimum value of $15,000.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It leaves room for negotiation without being too aggressive.

Remember, the goal is to earn as much as possible, but also to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can work within my budget if we can agree on a price of $9,000. I'm looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept an offer that doesn't at least get me closer to my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still allow me to make a profit while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between our interests and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still lower than what I want, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and is getting closer to my minimum. Accepting this offer will allow me to move forward and close the deal, which is valuable as I could potentially lose John as a buyer if I continue to negotiate with Bob."
