"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about we split the difference and I pay $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $125. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product to me. Let's try to meet in the middle.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you $122.50. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",122.5,Alice,5,
