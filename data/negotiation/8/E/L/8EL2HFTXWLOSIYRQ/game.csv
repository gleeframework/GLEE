"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's inherent worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me.  To be frank, I can get a similar product elsewhere for closer to a million.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's a firm limit for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  However, getting a comparable product at that price point is unlikely given the unique value proposition this offers. I'm willing to consider a significant compromise at $1,600,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is unique and valuable, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,100,000, but that's absolutely my limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options, even though I'd prefer to work with you.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you stretching your budget and aligning it closer to the value of this product. To bridge the remaining gap and demonstrate my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth while acknowledging your position.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too rich for me. I can go up to $1,200,000.  I think that's a very fair offer, and it avoids me having to go with another seller.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. I appreciate you recognizing the value this product brings. To close this deal today, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is my absolute final offer and reflects the significant concessions I've made to partner with you.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
