Round 5

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there. I appreciate you recognizing the value this product brings. To close this deal today, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is my absolute final offer and reflects the significant concessions I've made to partner with you.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very firm on her price, and while she's making concessions, she's unlikely to go below $1,300,000. At this point, accepting her offer would mean overpaying by $300,000 compared to John's offer. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
