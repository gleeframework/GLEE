{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm also willing to negotiate. It's important to present a compelling offer that highlights the value Bob will gain. By setting a price that's still attractive to Bob while leaving room for negotiation, I increase my chances of reaching a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial proposal, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept this offer yet. I'll counteroffer to try and close the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000.  This product has a high value for me, and I believe a price closer to this figure reflects that.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground. This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also highlights the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value to you, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is coming closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept this offer yet.  I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to find a price we can both agree on."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to finding a solution.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to maintain a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to agree, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but I need to be realistic about the value I can get from the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $925,000 is still below my minimum. I've reached my limit for negotiating with Bob and am not willing to risk further lowering the price.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
