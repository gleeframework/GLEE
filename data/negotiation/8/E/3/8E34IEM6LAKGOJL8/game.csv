"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $100, which is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. ",100.0,Bob,6,
