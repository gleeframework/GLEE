``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but it might still be attractive to Bob if he values the product highly.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, it's enough to get Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his initial offer, and I'm happy to accept $16,000. It's a decent amount more than my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
