"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $13,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming to keep it closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to do $12,500?  That's the highest I can go.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about we meet at $13,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
