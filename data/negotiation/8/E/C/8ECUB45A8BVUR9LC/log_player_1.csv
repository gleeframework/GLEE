Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards our price, indicating willingness to buy. We're getting close to the point where we might consider accepting, but with two rounds left, it's worth a final push to see if we can get closer to $1,400,000."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to make one last offer. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is my final offer.

(2) Reject Bob's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While we'd prefer a higher price, this is the last round, and Bob's final offer is still significantly higher than John's guaranteed $1,000,000. Accepting now secures a good profit.  Holding out risks losing Bob and getting stuck with John's lower offer."
