"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $8,500. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That way we both get a fair deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,700. Would that work for you?",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $8,700 is just a little too low for me.  How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting close. I could do $8,800 to get this done today.  What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference again and go with $8,900.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,7,
