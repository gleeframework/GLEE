Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $8,500, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
