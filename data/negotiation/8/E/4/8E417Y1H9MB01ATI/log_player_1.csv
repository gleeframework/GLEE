{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I will be moving forward with another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible while still enticing Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward if Bob tries to counter.
* **Deadline:**  Creates a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to make a decision rather than stall or lowball.
* **Not Revealing John's Offer:**  While John guarantees the minimum price, mentioning him could weaken Alice's negotiating position.  

**Why this is better than simply offering at $1,200,000:**

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still make more than her guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Psychological impact:** A slightly lower price might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal, even if it's still very favorable to Alice."
