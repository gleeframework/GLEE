Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob only values the product at $80, it's best to start with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering it at $120 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and you might be able to settle on a price higher than $80.
* **Considering the Alternative:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
