"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly more than your $80 limit and what John offers. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
