Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I'm confident it will sell quickly."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and even your minimum ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning other interested buyers and a limited-time offer, you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Justification:**  While the offered price is high, vaguely mentioning ""value and interest"" aims to create a sense that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 

**Important:**  This strategy involves risk. There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer, leading you to John (your $15,000 guarantee). However, it maximizes your potential profit if Bob accepts or negotiates down to a price still above your minimum."
