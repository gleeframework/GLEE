"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still allows room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible and open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept given the limited rounds, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  The risk of rejecting and going through more rounds is too high, especially considering I can sell to John for $15,000.  It's better to secure a sale at $13,000 than risk losing the deal altogether."
