"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
