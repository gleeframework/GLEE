Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer price of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you room for negotiation if needed.
    *  Attractive enough compared to your backup offer ($1,200,000) to entice Bob seriously.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure that might push Bob to accept.

**Important:**  This is just an initial offer.  You've positioned yourself well for potential negotiation while ensuring you don't leave money on the table."
