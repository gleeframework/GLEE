Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **My minimum:** I value the product at $10,000.  
* **John's offer:** John is willing to pay $10,000.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves me with a negotiation space of $5,000 ($15,000 - $10,000).
* **Risk mitigation:**  Offering $14,000 gives me a good chance of securing a higher price than John's offer while still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate. 

By offering $14,000, I'm aiming to maximize my earnings while also considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
