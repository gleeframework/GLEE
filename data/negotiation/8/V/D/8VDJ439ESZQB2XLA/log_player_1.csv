Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, and I can still make a good profit.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $1,250,000 is significantly less than my minimum of $1,500,000 and is a reasonable price for Bob, especially if he values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup who will pay my minimum, so I don't have to settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000 and is a poor deal for me.
* **Negotiation is Necessary:** Even though I have John as a backup, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **Counter Offer:**  I can make a counteroffer that is more appealing to me and still be reasonable to Bob.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm making a counteroffer to Bob at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $1,250,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.
* **Fair Price:**  $1,050,000 is still a good profit for me and significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. It's likely to be appealing to Bob as well.
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and might be enough to get Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Backup Option:** I'm still mindful of my backup option (John) and ready to walk away if this counteroffer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,025,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though I'm not getting my full asking price,  a successful deal with Bob might lead to future opportunities and a strong relationship.
* **Risk of Losing John:**  While John is a reliable buyer, I risk losing him if I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. There's no guarantee John will still be interested later.

Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good profit, while keeping the possibility of future business with Bob open."
