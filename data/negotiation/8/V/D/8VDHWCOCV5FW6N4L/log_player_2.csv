"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point. You want to see if you can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what you can get from John.  Since you're only willing to pay $1,000,000, you should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that the product's value is still worth more than that. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,020,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Since you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the best option to go with John. You've already tried to negotiate with Alice and reached a point where she's not willing to go lower."
