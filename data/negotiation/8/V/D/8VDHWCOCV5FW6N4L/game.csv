"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that the product's value is still worth more than that. Let me know if you're interested.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
