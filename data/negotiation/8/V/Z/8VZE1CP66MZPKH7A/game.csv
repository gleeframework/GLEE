"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
