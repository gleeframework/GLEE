"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my desired price. Let's meet in the middle - I'm proposing $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
