Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $12,000, I leave room for potential counteroffers and negotiations without risking a deal with John. 
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Although his offer is lower, it suggests he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I can likely get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,500, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $11,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't sell for less than what I deem the product is worth.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language like ""fair price"" and ""value of the product"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe $10,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this revised counteroffer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on $10,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on other opportunities.

Therefore, I will sell the product to John to ensure a profitable sale."
