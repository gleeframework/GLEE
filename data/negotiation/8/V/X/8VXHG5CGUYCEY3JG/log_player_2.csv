"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth negotiating further, especially when Alice is already offering a price significantly lower than her own valuation. There's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good starting point for negotiation. While $900,000 is still a significant price, it leaves room for Alice to counter and find a middle ground, as she's clearly willing to negotiate below her $1,000,000 valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows me to try and close the gap even further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a better deal. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. There's still some wiggle room and rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a better price. It's likely that Alice will accept this offer as it's only $5,000 away from her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $918,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $918,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price. While I could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are now quite small. It's getting close to the price I'd pay John, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice. There's a good chance that if I reject, Alice will counter with an even higher price, and I might end up paying more than $918,000."
