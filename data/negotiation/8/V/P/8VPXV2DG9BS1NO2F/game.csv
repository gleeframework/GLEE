"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $16000 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to consider this price?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Can you consider this price?",16500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet on this one, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further.",15000.0,Alice,9,
