Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if needed. If Bob rejects this offer, it will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product.  I'll then adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the risk of losing out to John's $1,500,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to try and get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm prepared to go down to $1,500,000 if necessary to avoid losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $800,000 offer, which is far too low for me. While I could keep negotiating, I'm concerned about wasting time and potentially losing out on John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more promising buyer."
