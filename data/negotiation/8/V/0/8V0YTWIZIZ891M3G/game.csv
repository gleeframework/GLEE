"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product like this, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $12000, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere. Can you consider $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $16000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to buy the product from John for $12000, but I'd rather buy it from you if we can agree on a price. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
