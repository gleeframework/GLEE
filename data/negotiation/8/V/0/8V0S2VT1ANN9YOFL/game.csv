"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need something closer to my original offer. How about $850,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $775,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit, while still providing you with a valuable product.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $825,000, which is $800,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer $795,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $795,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $810,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",810000.0,Alice,7,
