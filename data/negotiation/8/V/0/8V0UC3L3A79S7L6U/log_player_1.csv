"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $6,000 is far too low for me, and I can get $12,000 from John. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product holds value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I can get from John. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. Let's try $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}
