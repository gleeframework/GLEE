Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1,000,000 to $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good deal. It's significantly more than John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
