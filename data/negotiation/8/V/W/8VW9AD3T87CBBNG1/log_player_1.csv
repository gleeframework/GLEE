Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to be negotiated.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to capture any of that surplus.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but be realistic. While you could try for the full $1,200,000, it leaves Bob with no incentive to agree.  A more balanced approach is to aim for a price that splits the surplus.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You directly address Bob and highlight the product's value to him.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""after careful consideration"" implies you've weighed different factors.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  $1,100,000 gives both of you a $100,000 gain compared to your respective alternatives. This makes it a fair and appealing offer for Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you are in Bob's eagerness to buy."
