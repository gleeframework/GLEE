"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for your product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $13,000 as a potential price for your product. This is my highest offer, and I hope it aligns with your expectations.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $13,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $14,000 to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
