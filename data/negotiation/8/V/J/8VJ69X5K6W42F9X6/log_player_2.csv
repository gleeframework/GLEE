**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand and stated this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, we're already significantly below her starting price and have a good deal at $800,000.  It's unlikely we'll get a much better price without risking her walking away or pushing the negotiation too close to the John alternative."
