"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,250, which is a better deal than John's $15,000. It's also closer to Bob's target price. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer or further lowering the price increases. Accepting this offer ensures a purchase at a good price."
