"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for being willing to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  I'm happy to pay $950000, which is a fair compromise and a good value for both of us.  Please let me know if you're open to this.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is a bit closer to your last offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1050000 is still just a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider my other options.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
