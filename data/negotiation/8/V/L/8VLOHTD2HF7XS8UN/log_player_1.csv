{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $150.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $100 minimum.
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off right away.
* **It's accompanied by a positive message:** You're trying to build a rapport and make Bob feel valued. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price and messaging based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than your minimum of $100, you can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate further:**  You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, potentially getting closer to your target.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Seeing how far Bob is willing to go might influence your counteroffer and overall negotiation strategy. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  You're showing flexibility by moving from your initial $150 to $135.
* **Positive messaging:**  You're trying to keep Bob engaged by expressing your willingness to make the deal work.
* **Fairness:** You're presenting $135 as a compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

This counteroffer balances the need to get a better price with keeping the negotiation open.  You're still above your minimum of $100, but also showing willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is very close to your initial counteroffer of $135 and represents a significant increase from your minimum of $100. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a failed sale. It's crucial to balance potential gains with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
