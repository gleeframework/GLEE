Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming slightly below that maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a profitable range for you.
* **John as Backup:** Having John guarantees at least $800,000, allowing for a bolder offer to Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a fallback option."
