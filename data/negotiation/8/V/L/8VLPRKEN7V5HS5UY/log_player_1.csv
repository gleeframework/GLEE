{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always worth attempting to secure an even higher price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I need to offer a price that's appealing yet profitable for me.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying firmly above Bob's valuation and below my guaranteed sale price. This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a deal if he negotiates down slightly.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value, increasing the perceived worth."
