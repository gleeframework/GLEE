"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with an ambitious but not insulting offer. This anchors the negotiation higher. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" we provide a reason for the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The $2,250,000 price tag allows for significant negotiation downwards while still staying well above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep the John option in our back pocket, giving us leverage if the negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that initial price is way too high for me. I'm willing to start the conversation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both his own perceived value ($1,000,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). Accepting this would be a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate and the John option provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging we're in a negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** We want to show willingness to negotiate but avoid drastic price drops that could signal desperation. 
* **Reiterating Value:** We continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the still-high price.
* **Framing:** By positioning the reduction as a step ""forward,"" we nudge Bob towards a collaborative mindset. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We are still significantly above Bob's offer and our minimum, keeping the John option viable if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be realistic, I can't go any higher than $1,200,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer!  While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is now above his perceived value, it's still below our $1,500,000 minimum.  We have room to negotiate, and it seems Bob is willing to move closer to our range. We'll reject and counter, aiming to settle somewhere between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  How about we land somewhere in the middle at $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're proposing a price exactly halfway between Bob's last offer ($1,200,000) and our previous ask ($1,900,000). This classic negotiation tactic can signal fairness and a desire to close the deal.
* **Above Minimum, Below Initial Ask:** This price point keeps us comfortably above our $1,500,000 minimum while still being significantly lower than our initial offer. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** We frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With rounds decreasing, we want to guide the negotiation towards a close while still aiming for a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Strong Movement:** Bob has significantly increased his offer from $1,200,000 to $1,350,000, showing a strong commitment to securing the deal. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  We only have four rounds left, and there's no guarantee that continuing to negotiate will result in a significantly better outcome. We risk Bob walking away or our offers becoming too close to the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

This offer represents a solid profit, and the momentum suggests it's a good time to close the deal."
