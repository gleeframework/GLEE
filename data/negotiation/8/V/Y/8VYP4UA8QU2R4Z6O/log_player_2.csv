Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go down to your target price. She's already made several concessions and is holding firm above your limit.  It's time to cut your losses and get the guaranteed deal from John."
