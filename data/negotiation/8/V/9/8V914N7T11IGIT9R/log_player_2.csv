"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $100. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above Alice's valuation of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully convinces Alice to make a concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price, but it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $87.50, which is right in the middle of our two last offers.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to chip away at the price, moving closer to my target price while leaving some room for further negotiation. By offering a price in the middle of our last two offers, I'm showing that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but not willing to settle for a price that's too high."
