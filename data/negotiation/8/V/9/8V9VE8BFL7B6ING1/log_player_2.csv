"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high.  We want to get the price down as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows us to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value to me is $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still too high. I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can push the price down further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is getting closer to my desired price range, I'm still aiming for something lower. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can push the price down further.  There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is now very close to my desired price range.  While I could continue negotiating,  there's a risk that I'll lose the opportunity to buy the product from Alice altogether.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a good price without risking further negotiations or potentially having to pay John's much higher price."
