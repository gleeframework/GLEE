"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to his ideal price point, but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to start the negotiation process in a way that is both fair and beneficial to Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a price that's within Bob's budget and closer to his ideal price point.  It's a good deal for Bob, and he should accept it before potentially missing out on the product entirely.  Buying from John for $12,000 would be more expensive."
