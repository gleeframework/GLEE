"I understand that $1000000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $1000000.  It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident this product is worth that to me.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
