"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to you ($900,000 vs. your $1,200,000 limit). You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, considering the product's value to me. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm eager to hear your thoughts.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $925,000 is still above my maximum price point of $1,200,000. It's a better offer than the initial $900,000, but it's still not in my best interest. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value we've both agreed on. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within my budget of $1,200,000 and is a significant improvement over her previous offers. While I'd prefer to pay less, accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of having to purchase it from John at a much higher price."
