"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I do like it, $200 seems a bit steep.  Would you be willing to consider a lower price, closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $160? I'm confident you'll find this price fair for the value you're getting.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate a bit. $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you consider $100?  That's a fair offer considering the going rate for similar products.",100.0,Bob,4,
