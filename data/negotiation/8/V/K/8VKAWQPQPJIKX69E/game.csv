"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $10500 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. It's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $10200 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",10200.0,Bob,4,
