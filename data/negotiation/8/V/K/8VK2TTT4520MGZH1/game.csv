"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $9,500?  This gives you a great deal on the product, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered it carefully, but I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial target. How about $9,000 for the product? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
