"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $112.50. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",112.5,Bob,6,
