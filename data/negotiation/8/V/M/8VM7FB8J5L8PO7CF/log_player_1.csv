Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's a good starting point. It allows for room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. I'll be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters, but I'm hoping this aggressive opening will encourage him to seriously consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'd like to see if I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further compromise if necessary. I believe this price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it might be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is closer to my desired price. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a good compromise.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a loss compared to Bob's offer."
