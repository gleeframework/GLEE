"Bob, I understand your position.  $8500 is definitely a good deal, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $9000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8750.  I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",8750.0,Alice,7,
