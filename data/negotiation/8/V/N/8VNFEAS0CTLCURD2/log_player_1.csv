Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you room for negotiation if needed.
    * It's still attractive enough that Bob might consider it a good deal, especially if he highly values the product's unique aspects.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially influencing Bob to act quickly. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You achieve a profit of $150,000 over your guaranteed sale. 
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly while still remaining above your minimum. 
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed with selling to John at your guaranteed price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while considering the dynamics of negotiation and Bob's potential willingness to pay."
