Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to potentially earn more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for him to find a deal.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The message creates a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") and scarcity (""other interested parties""), prompting Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your potential profit."
