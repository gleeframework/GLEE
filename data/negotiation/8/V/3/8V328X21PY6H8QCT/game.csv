"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've seen similar products in the market for that price, and I'd like to get a good deal. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $80 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room to make this work. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we meet at $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can close this deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to cover your costs, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to meet you at $90, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that price?",90.0,Bob,6,
