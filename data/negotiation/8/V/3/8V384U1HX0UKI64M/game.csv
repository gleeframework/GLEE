"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to lower my price to $16,000.  This gives you a good price, and it's fair to me. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $14,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,500 is still quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and lower my price to $15,500. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. If you're truly interested, I believe this is the best we can do.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's the highest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,6,
