"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and is within Bob's budget. This allows for potential negotiation while still leaving room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $11,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  Bob is closer to John's offer of $8,000, so he can potentially use this as leverage in the next round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still trying to save as much as possible. A counteroffer of $10,000 is a compromise, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway, while still staying within his preferred range. This could potentially push Alice to accept, or at least provide a good starting point for further negotiation."
