"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers unique value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be frank, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I was hoping for. However, I value our developing business relationship and I'm motivated to find an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant concession and reflects my strong desire to work with you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is getting closer, but still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a serious offer, and if you want to work with me, I think this is a good place for us to meet.",950000.0,Bob,6,
