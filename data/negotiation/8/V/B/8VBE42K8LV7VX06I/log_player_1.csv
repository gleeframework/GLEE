Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you'll see. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" and emphasizing ""return on investment,"" you're framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion. Asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" encourages him to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Potentially secure a significantly higher price from Bob.
2. **Gauge Interest:**  Understand Bob's level of interest and willingness to pay a premium.
3. **Secure a Sale:** Even if Bob negotiates down, you're starting from a strong position and are likely to secure a price well above your minimum."
