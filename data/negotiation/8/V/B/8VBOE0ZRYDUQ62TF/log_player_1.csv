Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That's still a good deal for you and gets me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Can you consider $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $82 is still lower than my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing the sale to John."
