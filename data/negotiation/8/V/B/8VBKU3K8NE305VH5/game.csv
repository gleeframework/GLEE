"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the price point, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to do $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $85 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $92.50 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $90? It's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
