"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm aiming for a high profit, but I'm also aware of the potential to lose the deal if I'm too greedy.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to reject this offer and counter with a more reasonable price. I will aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but with some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still securing a good profit for myself.  I'm also leaving some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below where I want to be. I'm going to reject this offer and counter again. I need to be firm, but also be willing to compromise a bit to get this deal done."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,600,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still holding my ground on price. We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident that we can find a mutually acceptable price in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not high enough. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price that is closer to my desired outcome, but also shows Bob that I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'm running out of time, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm getting close to the end of our negotiation window, and I'm hoping this final offer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very late in the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. John is offering a safe and guaranteed profit, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
