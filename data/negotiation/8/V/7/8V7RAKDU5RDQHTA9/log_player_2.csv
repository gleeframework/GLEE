"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can get a better deal by counteroffering Alice. You can likely get the price down closer to your $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than your ideal price. It gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much, and also sets the stage for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now within your acceptable range, and although you could try to negotiate further, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John at a higher price is too great. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
