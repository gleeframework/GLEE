"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. This is a one-time opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up for $10,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice is bluffing. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
