Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm offering Bob a price that is higher than my guaranteed value from John, but not exorbitantly high.  This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I want to get as much as possible from Bob.
* **Encourage acceptance:** A reasonable offer might be more appealing to Bob than a ridiculously high one that he'd likely reject.

However, I need more information to make a better offer.  For example, what is Bob's general reputation? Is he known to be a tough negotiator, or is he more likely to accept a fair deal?  Knowing more about Bob could help me tailor my offer to increase my chances of getting the best price."
