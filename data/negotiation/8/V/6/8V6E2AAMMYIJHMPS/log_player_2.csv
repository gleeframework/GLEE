It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice since you're willing to pay up to $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

Alice's offer is getting closer to your goal, but it's still above your budget. Buying from John at $10,000 is the best option in this scenario, as you've already made a significant effort to negotiate with Alice."
