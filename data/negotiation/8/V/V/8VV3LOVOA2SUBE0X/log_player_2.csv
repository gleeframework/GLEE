"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to Bob's target, given she's already lowered her price once."
