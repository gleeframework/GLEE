"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
