{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a bit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob is offering my minimum price, so I'm going to accept his offer. It's better than selling to John for the same price, and I've secured a deal in just 4 rounds!"
