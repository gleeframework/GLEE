"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a bit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $9,000 is above your budget, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price. You have more negotiation rounds left, so it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
