"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for $12,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget than $20,000, it is still higher than his ideal price and he can get the product from John for $12,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  I'm still not comfortable with $17,000. I'm willing to pay $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
