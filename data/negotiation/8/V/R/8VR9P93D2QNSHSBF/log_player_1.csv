Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a price above your minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $175 offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
