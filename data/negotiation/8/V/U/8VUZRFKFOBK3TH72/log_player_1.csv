Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't undervalue my product.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential value for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:** While it's closer than his initial value assessment, it's still not profitable enough for me. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John's offer:** I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a subpar offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price.
* **Still above my minimum:** This counteroffer keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Positive but firm tone:** The message expresses willingness to compromise but maintains a firm stance on the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to decide if his next counteroffer is worth considering or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob could lead to further concessions and a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will inform Bob that I've decided to sell to another buyer and thank him for his time. 
* I will then proceed to finalize the sale with John."
