"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing it further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $2,300,000 is quite high. I'm thinking closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This price reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  I'm prepared to offer you a final opportunity to secure the product for $1,750,000. This offer stands until the end of the next round. Let me know your decision.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for clarifying the situation. I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  My absolute final offer is $1,200,000. Take it or leave it.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
