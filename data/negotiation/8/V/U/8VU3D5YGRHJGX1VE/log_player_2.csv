"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice further. $13,000 is still a bit high, and there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$12,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay, and there's still room for negotiation.  I'll see if I can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000.  However, I'm still only able to go up to $11,500.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
