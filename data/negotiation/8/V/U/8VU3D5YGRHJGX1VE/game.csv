"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000.  However, I'm still only able to go up to $11,500.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
