"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and rarity, I believe it's worth $800,000. Let's discuss if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no advantage to buying from John at this point, as Alice's offer is the same."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000, given my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  A significant counteroffer of $700,000 shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** A $100,000 gap between Bob's offer and Alice's price provides space for both parties to adjust and find a middle ground.
* **Respectful but firm:** The message is polite but clearly states Bob's financial limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline your offer. To ensure we're both satisfied, I propose a price of $750,000 for the product. This still reflects its true value while being more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved from $800,000 to $750,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Good deal:** $750,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to the initial asking price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible.  Accepting the offer guarantees a deal at a good price, which aligns with Bob's goal of saving money."
