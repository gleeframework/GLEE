"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to consider your product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects its true worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you believe the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
