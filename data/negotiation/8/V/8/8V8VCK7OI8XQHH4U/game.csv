"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great fit for your needs. My initial offer is $950000. This price reflects the product's true worth and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but not that much. How about $900000? It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000.  This would be a good compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
