Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $680,000.

Alice is very consistently trying to meet in the middle.  While we could likely push her a *little* lower, the difference at this point probably isn't worth the risk of her walking away or us running out of rounds.  $690,000 is a solid price considering our $1,500,000 valuation."
