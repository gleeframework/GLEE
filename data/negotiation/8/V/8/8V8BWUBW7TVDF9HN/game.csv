"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer.  However, $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $650,000.  This is a fair offer considering it's well below my maximum and I'm taking on the risk of this product.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000.

"I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $680,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering it to you for $690,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",690000.0,Alice,7,
