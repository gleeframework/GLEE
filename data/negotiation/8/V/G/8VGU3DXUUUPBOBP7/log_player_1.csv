"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is quite low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I see you're serious about this product.  How about we settle at $12,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial asking price and a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you possibly do $10,500? I think that's a fair offer considering John is also offering the product at $10,000.
