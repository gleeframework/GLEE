"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is quite low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I see you're serious about this product.  How about we settle at $12,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial asking price and a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you possibly do $10,500? I think that's a fair offer considering John is also offering the product at $10,000.",10500.0,Bob,6,
