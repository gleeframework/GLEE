"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my maximum offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too far below the product's actual value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my maximum offer of $800,000.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your stance, but I also need to ensure a fair deal. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,700,000. This is a major concession on my part, and it brings us closer to a workable solution.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $1,700,000 is still out of reach for me. I'm sticking to my maximum offer of $800,000. Let's see if we can finalize this deal, or I'll need to move on to other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've shown considerable flexibility to make this deal work. However, I need to see some movement on your end. This is my final offer: $1,600,000.  If you're unable to accept this, I'll have to proceed with another buyer who's prepared to meet my asking price.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
