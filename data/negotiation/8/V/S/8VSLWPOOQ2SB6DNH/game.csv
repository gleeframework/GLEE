"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll be impressed once you learn more about it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
