"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $1,350,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,300,000, so how about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  Let's make it happen.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but no more. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
