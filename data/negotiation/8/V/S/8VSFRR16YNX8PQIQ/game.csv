"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I believe we can find a price closer to the value of the product to both of us. How about $1,300,000? This would still allow me to save quite a bit compared to the market value, while also being closer to your valuation.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This gives you a significant saving and allows me to get a fair price for my product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I see your point, Alice. Let's try to find a common ground. Considering the value of the product to both of us, how about $1,325,000? This is a bit closer to your original offer, yet still provides a good saving for me.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
