{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a significant saving. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,450,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,450,000 is lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $1,500,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting at a ridiculously low price, indicating you believe in your product's value. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while also safeguarding your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I believe we can find a price closer to the value of the product to both of us. How about $1,300,000? This would still allow me to save quite a bit compared to the market value, while also being closer to your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
