"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. I believe this product would be a significant benefit to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000. This offer represents a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is within your budget, but you want to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product is worth significantly more to you given its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I believe this is a fair and reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay. You can continue to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price. You have 7 rounds remaining, so there is still time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to offer $1,375,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also ensuring a reasonable profit for you."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,390,000?  This would allow me to feel comfortable letting go of this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,390,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,390,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** Alice's offer of $1,390,000 is very close to your target price of $1,375,000.
* **Limited rounds:** You have only 5 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Potential for future negotiation:** Even if you accept this offer, you might still be able to negotiate a lower price for future purchases or services from Alice."
