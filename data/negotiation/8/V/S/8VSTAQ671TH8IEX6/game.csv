,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product is worth significantly more to you given its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I believe this is a fair and reasonable price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to offer $1,375,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also ensuring a reasonable profit for you.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,390,000?  This would allow me to feel comfortable letting go of this valuable asset.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
