Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,000 is ideal, the slightly higher offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down a little if he wishes, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the potential delay of going to John, even though John guarantees the $8,000."
