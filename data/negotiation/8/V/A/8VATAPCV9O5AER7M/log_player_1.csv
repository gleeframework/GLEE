Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The price is also slightly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, leaving room for a potential compromise.
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to create a positive negotiation atmosphere.

This strategy allows me to potentially maximize my earnings while still being open to negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly, or move on to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, it's still below my $15,000 threshold. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price, but still leaves some room for compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could sell to John for $15,000,  there's a chance I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer for now, as I believe I can potentially achieve a higher price by continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer above Bob's offer:** My counteroffer of $13,500 is higher than Bob's offer of $13,000, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Compromise:** This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Positive message:** The message emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation and keeps the negotiation friendly.

This counteroffer allows me to stay within my acceptable range while showing flexibility and keeping the negotiation moving forward. If Bob still refuses, I can re-evaluate my options, including selling to John, but for now, I believe continuing the negotiation has the potential for a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $13,200 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but still below:** While Bob's offer is only $800 below my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I consider fair given the value of the product.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to more back-and-forth, potentially wasting time and energy.
* **Guaranteed price with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, securing the deal and eliminating further negotiation.

While it would be ideal to earn more, I'm prioritizing a secure and timely sale. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring my minimum profit and ending the negotiation with Bob."
