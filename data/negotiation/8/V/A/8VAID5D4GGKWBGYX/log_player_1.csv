"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While the product holds significant value at $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While we're getting closer, Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. We have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $900,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $900,000? This offer reflects the product's true value while still providing you with a significant benefit."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're now getting close to Bob's initial counter-offer and a price point that might be tempting for him. This offer shows willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a reasonable valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is not approaching our minimum acceptable price quickly enough. We've made significant concessions, and he's still substantially below our $900,000 target. At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations outweighs the potential reward, especially when we have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed profit."
