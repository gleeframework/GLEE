Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we can aim significantly higher. Starting at $1,200,000 gives us substantial room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value might be even higher by mentioning a public listing. This can justify the high price without revealing our true bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer anticipates Bob might negotiate. If he rejects the initial price, we can still go down considerably and make a profit above our guaranteed sale."
