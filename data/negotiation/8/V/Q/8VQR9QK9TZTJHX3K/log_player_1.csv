""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,100,000 is significantly more attractive to Bob than his perceived value of $800,000, potentially enticing him to accept.
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a decision without giving him excessive time to overthink or negotiate.

**Important Note:** This offer is based on the information provided.  Real-world negotiations often involve factors like relationship dynamics, market conditions, and additional leverage points that could influence the strategy."
