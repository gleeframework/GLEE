"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to make a substantial profit.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below Bob's estimated value, it's still significantly higher than Alice's value.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm hoping for a price that's closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still gives you a great deal and allows me to make a profit I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's ideal price.** The offer is $950,000, which is only $50,000 more than Bob's counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming and uncertain.**  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer in the next round, and continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob ultimately paying more if he has to buy from John.
* **Accepting the offer is a good compromise.** It allows Bob to buy the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer, and it's likely a fair price for both parties."
