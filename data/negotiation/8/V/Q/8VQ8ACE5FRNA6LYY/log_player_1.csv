{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  However, I'm not willing to go too low, as I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in buying, but I'd offer $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $85, I believe I can get closer to my minimum price point of $100.  I'll counter with a price closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll agree that it's a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95 to Bob. This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price point of $100, and it's still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $80. Hopefully, he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum price point, I'm still not happy with it. I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down just a little more to $92. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

I'm offering $92 to Bob. This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price point of $100, and it's still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $80.  Since I've already rejected two of his offers, I'm hoping this will convince him to accept the deal.  If not, I'll move on to John."
