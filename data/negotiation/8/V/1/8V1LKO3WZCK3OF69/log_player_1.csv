Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $115. I believe it's highly valuable and you'll benefit from it greatly."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $120, there's room to negotiate above your minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $115 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal (saving $5 from his perceived value), while you secure a $15 profit.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a safety net with John willing to buy the product for $100. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
