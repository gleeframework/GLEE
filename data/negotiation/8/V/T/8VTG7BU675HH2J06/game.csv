"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I can meet you in the middle at $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If not, I'm happy to discuss further, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
