"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you and the quality it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is still pretty high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the price as low as possible. Starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $80 limit.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be polite and express genuine interest while also conveying that the initial price is not feasible. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out the $60 figure, we're trying to anchor the negotiation lower. Even if Alice rejects it outright, it might make her subsequent counteroffers more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the integrity of our product pricing. How about we meet in the middle at $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $90 is better than $120, it's still above our $80 limit. There's a chance we can get Alice closer to our target price. 
* **Alice is Willing to Negotiate:**  Alice moving from $120 to $90 shows she's willing to negotiate. We might be able to bring her down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you finding some middle ground, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm still a little tight on budget. Could you do $75? That would help me seal the deal."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're inching closer to our $80 maximum while still leaving some room for a potential final compromise with Alice.
* **Signaling Interest:** Expressing that $75 would ""seal the deal"" emphasizes our genuine interest in the product and motivates Alice to close the sale. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The tone remains respectful and appreciative, which can go a long way in negotiations."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try $80 for the product. This is the highest I can go while maintaining the value of our product. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice has met our maximum budget of $80. 
* **No Point in Pushing Further:**  Trying to negotiate a lower price is unlikely and might make Alice withdraw the offer entirely. 
* **Success:** We managed to save money compared to the initial offer and secured the product within our budget!"
