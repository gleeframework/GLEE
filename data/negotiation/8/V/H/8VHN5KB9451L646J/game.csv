"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $140 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it, as that's my maximum budget. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $100.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
