"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get from this investment.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a specific budget in mind, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the value that I've placed on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $600000 to make it worth my while. I'm thinking of a price of $750000. What are your thoughts on that?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $675000, but I think that's the maximum I can comfortably go. Can we meet at this price?",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $675000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $725000? I think it's a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $700000, but I think that's the maximum I can comfortably go. Can we meet at this price?",700000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $725000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that will give you exclusive access to additional features and support. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of the premium service package, Alice, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the extra cost. I'm willing to go up to $680000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price?",680000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find the best value for your investment, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $720000, and I'll throw in the premium service package again. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",720000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $680000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000.",680000.0,Bob,10,
