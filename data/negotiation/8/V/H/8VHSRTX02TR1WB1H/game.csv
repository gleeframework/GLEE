"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the value it brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,175,000 and call it a deal?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works.  However,  $1,175,000 doesn't reflect the value of what you're getting.  Would you consider $1,250,000? This is a very competitive offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting close. I'm willing to move up slightly.  How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
