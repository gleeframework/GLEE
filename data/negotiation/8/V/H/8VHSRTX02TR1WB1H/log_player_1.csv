Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

We're still significantly below John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works.  However,  $1,175,000 doesn't reflect the value of what you're getting.  Would you consider $1,250,000? This is a very competitive offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

This is a good spot to settle. Bob's offer now matches John's, and there's no guarantee we can push him higher in the remaining rounds. It's best to secure the deal now."
