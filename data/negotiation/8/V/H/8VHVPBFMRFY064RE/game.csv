"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8500.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  This is a fair compromise and allows us to both close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9250 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product is worth $10000 to you,  I'm willing to go up to $8900 as a final offer.  This is a good deal for both of us and lets us close the deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8900 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $9100. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both make a good deal.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I will have to consider other options.",9100.0,Alice,7,
