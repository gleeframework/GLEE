"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,112,500.  This price is still fair given the product's value.  What do you say?",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,075,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,112,500. Let's try $1,093,750. What do you think?",1093750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,093,750 is still a bit too low. How about we settle at $1,100,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and we can close the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,087,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1087500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,087,500 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,095,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to consider other options.",1095000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,095,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,092,500. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1092500.0,Bob,8,
