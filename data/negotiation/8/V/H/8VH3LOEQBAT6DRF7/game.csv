"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's start with $900,000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
