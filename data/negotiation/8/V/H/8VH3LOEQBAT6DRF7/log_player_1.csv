"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in future rounds. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
