"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's start with $900,000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $900,000, which is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can still negotiate a better price, and if you're unable to do so, you can always buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 800000}
