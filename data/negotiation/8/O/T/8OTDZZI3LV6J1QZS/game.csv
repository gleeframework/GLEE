"Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This reflects the true value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range.  I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
