"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
