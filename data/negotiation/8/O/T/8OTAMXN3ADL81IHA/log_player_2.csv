Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price."
