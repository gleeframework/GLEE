# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $950,000.  It's a great opportunity for you, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your maximum budget, you can get a better deal from John for $1,000,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll come down to John's price before committing."
