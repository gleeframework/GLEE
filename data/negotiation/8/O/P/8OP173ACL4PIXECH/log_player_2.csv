"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You're willing to pay a maximum of $100, and her price of $180 is unacceptable.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $100, this is your initial counteroffer.  You are hoping Alice will accept your offer, but you are prepared to either negotiate further or buy from John if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $160 is still above your maximum budget of $100. It's closer, but it's still not a good deal for you. Since John is willing to sell the product for $100, rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate with her makes sense.  You can try a counteroffer that's closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high for you, but you are willing to compromise a little. You are now offering $120, which is closer to your maximum budget of $100, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows you are serious about buying the product but are also firm on your price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $145 is closer to your budget, it is still higher than what you are willing to pay.  Since John is offering the product for $100, you should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating with her or buy the product from John.  

It's important to remember your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you can always get the product for $100 from John.  So, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice, but be prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still a bit too high. You're willing to meet her halfway, so you're offering $130. This counteroffer demonstrates that you are serious about buying the product, but you are also sticking to your budget. It also shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still above your maximum budget of $100.  While you have been willing to negotiate, you've reached a point where it's more beneficial to purchase the product from John for $100. Continuing to negotiate with Alice could drag the process out and might not result in a lower price that's acceptable to you.  

Since John is offering a price that fits within your budget and you're eager to acquire the product,  buying from John is the most efficient and cost-effective option at this point."
