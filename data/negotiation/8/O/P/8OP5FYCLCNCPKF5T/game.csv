"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
