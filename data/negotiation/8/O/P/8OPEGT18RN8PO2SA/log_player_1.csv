Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $10,000 (her walk-away point).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $2,000 profit margin to be split between Alice and Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $10,000 acts as Alice's safety net.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. Since Bob values the product at $2,000 more than Alice, she could aim for a price that splits the difference.

**The Offer**

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000. Let me know what you think!"",
  ""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Why this offer makes sense:**

* **Profitable for Alice:** Alice secures a $1,000 profit above her minimum.
* **Attractive to Bob:** Bob saves $1,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong starting point, there might be some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob counters. 

**Important Note:**  This assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation. If she knew he valued it at $12,000, she could push closer to that amount."
