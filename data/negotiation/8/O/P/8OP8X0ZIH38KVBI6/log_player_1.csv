{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This sets a strong baseline and gives Bob an opportunity to respond. It's possible he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great price for such a valuable product. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm offering $140, which is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still within my acceptable range. I'm hoping this will convince him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer. It's worth trying to see if we can reach an agreement before I sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm proposing $135, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and hopefully convinces him to accept."
