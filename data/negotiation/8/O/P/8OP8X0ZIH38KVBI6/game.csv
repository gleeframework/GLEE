"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great price for such a valuable product. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
