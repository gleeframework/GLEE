"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. This price should still reflect the value of the product, but it's more in line with my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. $775,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm prepared to lower my price to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while respecting your budget constraints.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,

This is the maximum I can afford, and I'm willing to take the risk of not getting the product if it's not a good fit for me. Can you consider my final offer?",800000.0,Bob,6,
