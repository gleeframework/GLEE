{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something valuable at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and professional, emphasizing the value of the product and leaving the door open for discussion.
* **John as a safety net:**  While I want to get the best price from Bob, I'm aware of John's offer as a backup. This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully sold the product and achieved a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer, considering the potential value of continued negotiations against the security of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off the mark to accept. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is a starting point for negotiations, it's too low to justify accepting. There's still room to negotiate a better price.
* **John's Offer:**  I have John's offer of $1,000,000, which provides a safety net. This allows me to be more assertive and reject unreasonable offers.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still acknowledging his budget constraints.
* **Evaluate:** I'll carefully assess Bob's response to my counteroffer, considering the possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, especially if negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $850,000, which is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. 
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget concerns but emphasizes the product's value. I'm framing it as a fair deal for both parties.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a compromise that allows me to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, while leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a backup, which gives me confidence to negotiate firmly with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer. Depending on his response, I'll decide whether to:
    *  Accept his counteroffer if it's close to my desired price.
    *  Make a new counteroffer if it's still too low.
    *  Sell the product to John if negotiations become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. This price should still reflect the value of the product, but it's more in line with my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still too far off my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Accepting $775,000 would mean losing a substantial amount of money. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have John's offer of $1,000,000, which guarantees me a much better return. I am not willing to risk losing that for a small gain over Bob's current offer.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to compromise, it's still not in my best interest. There's a possibility he might come closer to my price with further negotiation, but I'm not willing to risk it when a secure offer from John exists.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price, but I'll be cautious to avoid a price too low for me.
* **Evaluate:**  I'll carefully assess Bob's response to my counteroffer, considering the possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer as my fallback option, as it provides a guaranteed sale at a much better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. $775,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm prepared to lower my price to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while respecting your budget constraints.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $825,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's offer of $775,000.  
* **Message:** I'm framing this counteroffer as a significant compromise and highlighting the fairness of the deal. I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while still emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still keeping the price above Bob's initial offer. It allows for further negotiation but also presents a reasonable price that Bob might accept. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind. This gives me the confidence to be firm but also allows for a potential win-win scenario with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I will carefully assess Bob's response to my counteroffer. 
    * If he accepts, I'll be happy to sell the product at $825,000.
    * If he rejects, I'll consider if it's worthwhile to make another counteroffer or if it's better to move on and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800,000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I'm willing to take the risk of not getting the product if it's not a good fit for me. Can you consider my final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $800,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a good deal for me. Considering that I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the sure win. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and accepting $800,000 would mean losing a significant amount of money.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is a sure thing, guaranteeing me a much better return than what Bob is offering. 
* **Risk:**  Negotiating further with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my offer and me potentially ending up with nothing.

**Conclusion:**

It's better to take the guaranteed profit from John rather than risk losing a significant amount of money and potentially ending up with no sale."
