"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in rejecting and seeing if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a significant reduction, but it's within the range of what I'm willing to pay. It's likely Alice will counter, but this should start the negotiation process and put pressure on her to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my target of $5,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $5,500. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my ideal. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer, and hopefully, it will encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,200 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm close to my desired price point, and with a few more rounds, I might be able to push Alice down to $5,500 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $5,800. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price that Alice might accept. I'm getting closer to my target price, and I'm willing to be flexible at this point, but I'm not willing to go above $6,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $6,100, which is very close to my target price of $5,800. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a good deal for me and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the product.  There are only a few rounds left, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price."
