"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to breathe. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
