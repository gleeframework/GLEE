"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum price of $150, you know you have another option with John. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of getting a better price. It's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price or moving on to John."
