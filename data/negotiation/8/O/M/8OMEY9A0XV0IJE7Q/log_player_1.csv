"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and creating a sense of a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that implies I'm open to discussion and encourages Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Round 1 Strategy:** In the first round, I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play along. I'm willing to potentially drop the price slightly in later rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's also far less than the product's worth to me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  Accepting $80 would be a huge loss for me. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Round 2 Strategy:** I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'll aim for a price that keeps the deal moving forward but also protects my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is lower than I can go, I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but I'm also staying firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Middle Ground:**  $125 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is still a good deal for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider accepting. 
* **Round 3 Strategy:**  By offering a middle ground price, I'm hoping to entice Bob to accept. If he still refuses, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer, but I'll need to assess whether I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $100? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is at My Minimum:** $100 is my minimum acceptable price, but it doesn't leave any room for profit.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  I've already made a significant compromise. It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer much further.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $50, which is a more desirable outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks running out of time and having to accept a lower price or even lose the sale completely. 

**Round 4 Strategy:** It's time to cut my losses and secure the sale to John. While I'd prefer to make a larger profit, it's better to guarantee a decent profit than risk getting nothing."
