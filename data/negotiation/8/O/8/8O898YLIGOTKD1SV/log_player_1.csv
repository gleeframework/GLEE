``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still within a reasonable range for Bob to consider. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to me is $15,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my budget, I am unable to go above $15,000. Could we possibly find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Bob has been firm on his price, and I've already counter-offered once.  It's unlikely he will budge further, and continuing to negotiate would risk losing time and ultimately getting the same price from John.  I'm confident in John's willingness to buy, so I'll take the guaranteed $15,000."
