"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need to get at least $11000 for the product.  I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. I think that's a fair price for a great product like this.",10500.0,Bob,4,
