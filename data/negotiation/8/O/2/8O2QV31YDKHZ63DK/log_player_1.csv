"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $10,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $12,000."
