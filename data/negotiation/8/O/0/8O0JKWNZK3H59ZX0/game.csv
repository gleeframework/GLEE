"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,250 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
