Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm interested in selling this product. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep for me.  Could you do $11,500? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $11,500 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has risks. Bob might lower his offer or walk away entirely. Accepting now secures a good deal. 

While you could try for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is small compared to the risk of losing the sale altogether.
