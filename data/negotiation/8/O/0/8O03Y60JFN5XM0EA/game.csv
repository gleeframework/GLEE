"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep for me.  Could you do $11,500? I think that's a fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
