"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows you to make a profit, while also giving me a fair return.  Let's meet in the middle!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit and keeps this deal on track.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,025,000. This price is a good compromise for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit margin and me a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This price represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
