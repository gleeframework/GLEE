"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product has to Bob, hoping to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a friendly invitation to discuss the offer, showing I'm open to negotiation. 

**Important Note:** My goal is to maximize my profit, but also understand that selling to John for $1,000,000 is a solid backup option. I'll be carefully evaluating Bob's responses and counteroffers to determine the best course of action."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price right now, as selling to John would net me more.  However, I'm also not ready to completely abandon this deal with Bob.  There's still room for negotiation, and I can use this opportunity to gauge his true willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows you to make a profit, while also giving me a fair return.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still maintaining a price that's above my minimum.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer benefits both of us, allowing Bob to make a profit while ensuring I receive a fair price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation flowing. 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer keeps the deal alive with Bob while still ensuring I'm on track to reach my goal of earning at least $1,000,000.  I'm confident that Bob, who values the product at $800,000, will see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit and keeps this deal on track. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,000,000 I can get from John.  I'm not ready to sell at that price just yet.  I want to explore whether Bob is willing to go higher.  

**Reasoning:**

This round emphasizes the value of my product. Bob has consistently shown a willingness to negotiate, but he's still significantly below my minimum.  However, I want to see if there's more room to maneuver before resorting to my backup option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,025,000. This price is a good compromise for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit margin and me a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This tactic shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of logic by suggesting a price that is a fair middle ground.
* **Highlighting Profit Margin:** I'm emphasizing Bob's potential profit margin to further incentivize him to accept the offer.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong attempt to bridge the gap between our expectations. It's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is truly serious about getting the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John to avoid risking further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This price represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price. At this point, with only four rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Limited:**  With only four rounds remaining, the window for reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is shrinking.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing both deals, leaving me with nothing.  

It's a difficult decision, but securing a guaranteed $1,000,000 is the most prudent choice at this point in the negotiation."
