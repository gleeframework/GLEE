{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good profit for you considering your value of $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's getting closer, it's still worth continuing to negotiate to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering your value and my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit short of where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good investment for you.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,200,000.  Given that Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at a price that fits his budget, it's more advantageous to take the sure thing and buy from John. Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it also carries the risk of the deal falling apart or the rounds running out.  Buying from John minimizes risk and ensures a successful purchase within the desired budget."
