"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good profit for you considering your value of $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering your value and my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit short of where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good investment for you.  Let's finalize this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
