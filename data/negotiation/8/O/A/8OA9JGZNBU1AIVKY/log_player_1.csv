"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what Bob values the product at ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not setting the price at my minimum ($120) because I want to be open to counteroffers, but still ensure I get a decent profit.
* **Positive Language:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage his acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim for Higher Profit:**  While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum target of $120. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:** I believe there's still potential for negotiation.  Bob is already willing to go up from his initial valuation of $100, indicating he sees value in the product. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $110 for the product. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By offering $110, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $105 and my previous offer of $115. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" and the mutual benefit of the deal to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** $110 is still above my minimum target of $120, so I'm still getting a good return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $108? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $108 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but I'm still hesitant to accept it. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and there's still a small gap between our offers. I believe there's potential to get a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed profit, I'm willing to take a risk for a potentially higher return. I'll try to get Bob to budge just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to My Guns:** I'm sticking to my previous offer of $110, which is still a good profit for me. I believe Bob is close to accepting, and I don't want to give up too much more.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm reframing my offer as a ""fair price"" and emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal. This helps to soften the rejection and encourages Bob to consider my offer.
* **Motivating Action:** I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $107? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  While Bob is showing clear interest, the negotiations are getting closer to my minimum.  There's a risk that we'll keep going back and forth, wasting time and potentially ending up with a lower price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is a sure thing, offering my minimum price of $120. This guarantees me a profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations.
* **Time is Money:**  With only four rounds left, it's wise to take the safe option and secure a guaranteed profit rather than risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price."
