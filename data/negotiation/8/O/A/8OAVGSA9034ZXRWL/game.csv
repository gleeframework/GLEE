"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run.  Let me know if you're interested, but I'm happy to wait and sell it to John for $1,200,000 if it's not a good fit for you right now.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
