"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
