"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7000 is lower than my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $8500? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You can try to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. You have a good chance of getting a better price since Alice has already lowered her price from $10,000."
