"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in your product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $7000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7000 is lower than my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $8500? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you.",8250.0,Bob,4,
