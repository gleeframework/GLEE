Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is increasing his offers, it's clear we're unlikely to reach a price that satisfies my minimum. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
