Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price:**  $1,400,000 is well above my floor of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate without feeling like he's overpaying.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, I can still potentially come down a bit without dropping below my minimum. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I increase the chances of a successful deal while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, it's still lower than my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. There's still potential for a profitable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,350,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's close to my desired price, and it's likely that Bob won't budge further. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
