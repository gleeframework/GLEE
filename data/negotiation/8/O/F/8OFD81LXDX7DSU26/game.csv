"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
