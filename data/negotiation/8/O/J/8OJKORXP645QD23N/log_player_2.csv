"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have an exceptional opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's potential to negotiate a better price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price.  It shows you're serious about negotiating and willing to push for a lower price.

* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and friendly tone is important to keep the negotiation productive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can find a more agreeable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm happy to meet you at $800,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:**  The counteroffer of $800,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.

* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains polite and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward."
