Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, there's a window to sell it above your minimum price ($80) and below his maximum valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Secure a Deal:** Offering a price too close to $100 might make Bob hesitate. A slightly lower price increases the chance he'll accept immediately."
