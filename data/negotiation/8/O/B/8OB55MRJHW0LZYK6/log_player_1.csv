Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price higher than $15,000.
* **Time Value:**  A quick sale to Bob might be preferable even if it means slightly less profit than waiting for John. This message hints at that urgency without explicitly saying you have another buyer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes some flexibility in Bob's budget and a potential willingness to pay a premium for immediate access to the product."
