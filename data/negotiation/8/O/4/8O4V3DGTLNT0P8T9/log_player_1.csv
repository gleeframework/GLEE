Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price, as it's higher than what he values the product at, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  I'm confident he'll find this offer attractive, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price. I also have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $13,500.  This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a significant amount for the product, while also being more attractive to Bob than my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on."
