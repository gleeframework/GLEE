"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to get as much value as possible. This offer is above what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in it and be willing to negotiate. I'm confident that I can still close the deal at a price that's more than $15,000, which is what John is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a good compromise that shows I'm willing to work with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low. I believe this offer is still appealing to Bob, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up further. I'm still confident that I can reach a deal that's more beneficial to me than selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. This offer is still higher than what he's willing to pay, but it's also close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm being flexible and finally agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, but it's still not high enough.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I'm still hopeful I can close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm going to try one last time to push for a higher price with Bob.  I'm dropping my offer slightly again, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time.  I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but he's not willing to go higher.  It's time to secure a sale with John and guarantee myself at least $15,000."
