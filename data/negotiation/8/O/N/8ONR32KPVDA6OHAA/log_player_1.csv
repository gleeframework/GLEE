Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you consider $70 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about $85? That's just a bit off my bottom line."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and do $77.50? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach $80. Accepting his final offer of $77.50 would be a loss compared to John's guaranteed $80.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
