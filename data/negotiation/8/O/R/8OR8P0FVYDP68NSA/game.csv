"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to make sure it's worth it for me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $825,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
