``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is inclined to counteroffer. I'm confident in the value of my product to him, so I'm starting strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to make sure it's worth it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept $750,000, it's not worth risking losing out on a potentially higher price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $825,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is slightly higher than what I can get from John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a good compromise that allows me to sell the product and still get a decent profit.  It's better to accept the offer now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
