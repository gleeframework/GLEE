"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly narrow the price gap. He's offering a price that's closer to his maximum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** The message emphasizes the desire for a compromise, hinting at a potential middle ground. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The counteroffer is based on a reasoned assessment of the product's value to Bob, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above what he's willing to pay.
* **Potential for lower price:**  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further.
* **Evaluating John's offer:** Bob should consider John's offer of $1,000,000, but it's still worth exploring if he can secure the product for even less from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob makes it clear this is his final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  He acknowledges Alice's concession but emphasizes that he's already met her halfway.
* **John's Offer:**  Bob is now at his maximum price, so if Alice rejects, he can safely move to John's offer."
