Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you at $1,250,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Fair Value:** $1,250,000 splits the difference between Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000), making it a potentially attractive offer for him.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John at my desired price."
