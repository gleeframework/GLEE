"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and reducing the price to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, it's not quite where I need to be. Considering the value this product brings,  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's work together to bridge this gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which reflects the significant value you will gain from this product.  This price is still well within your budget and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
