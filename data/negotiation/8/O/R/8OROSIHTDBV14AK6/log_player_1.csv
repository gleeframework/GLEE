"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly inflated price, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.  I'm also conscious that I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price in the initial stages."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price above my minimum acceptable value. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still trying to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially since I have the safety net of selling to John at my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

I'm continuing to compromise, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have a guaranteed sale with John at my desired price, it's no longer worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
