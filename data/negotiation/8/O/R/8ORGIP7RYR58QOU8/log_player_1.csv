"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer to see if I can get closer to my target price.  

**Strategy:**

I will try to negotiate a price closer to my initial offer of $18,000.  I will use each round to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and adjust my counter-offers accordingly. If I can't get close to my target price, I will be willing to sell to John at $15,000 to ensure I don't lose out on any value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is my absolute minimum.  This product is worth a lot more, and I'm sure you'll agree once you have it.  Let's split the difference and settle on $16,500?"", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so I'll counter with $14500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counter-offer and attempt to secure a price closer to my target.  I'll keep in mind that John is a reliable backup option at $15,000, giving me some leverage in these negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $14,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's agree on $15,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make a final counteroffer of $14000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a great deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I've already made several concessions, and it's unlikely he'll budge further.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John at $15,000 guarantees a profit and ensures I don't waste more time on a negotiation that's unlikely to succeed. 

**Strategy:**

Given Bob's stubbornness and limited room for negotiation, selling to John is the most practical and profitable option.  I've secured a fair price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
