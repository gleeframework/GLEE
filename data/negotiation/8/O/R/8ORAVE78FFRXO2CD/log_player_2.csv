"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $13000 is closer to my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $13500. This reflects the value to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for Bob. It's still below his maximum price of $15,000 and closer to the product's value to Alice. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price and avoid the potential risk of further negotiation or buying from John at a higher price."
