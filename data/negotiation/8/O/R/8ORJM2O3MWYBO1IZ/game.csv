"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your valuation of $800000, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering my valuation of $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to accept $900000. Considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also taking into account your valuation of $800000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $1050000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our valuations.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to accept $1050000. Considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to accepting the offer from John, who is willing to pay the full $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
