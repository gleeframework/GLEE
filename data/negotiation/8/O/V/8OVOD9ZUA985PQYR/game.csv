"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. I believe this price is fair, considering my own valuation and your desired selling price. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,300,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
