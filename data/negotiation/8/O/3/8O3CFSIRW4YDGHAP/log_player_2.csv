Considering its value and quality, I propose a special offer of $140 for this product. This price not only reflects its true worth but also provides you with an excellent opportunity to acquire it at a competitive rate. I look forward to your positive response.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price.  By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive deal. This might prompt Alice to lower her price further, or you can buy from John for $150, saving $10."
