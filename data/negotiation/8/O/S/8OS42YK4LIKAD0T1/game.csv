"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,300,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $1,250,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,275,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,225,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,250,000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to acquire it at a favorable price.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that number?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
