"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping to find a good home for it and I know you'd appreciate it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $175 is higher than your maximum budget of $150 and also more expensive than buying from John.  You should reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
