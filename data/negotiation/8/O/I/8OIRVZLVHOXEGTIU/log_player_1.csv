Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valued at $10,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage with Bob.  Your goal is to see if Bob will pay a premium.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $12,500 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out on what you're presenting as a valuable deal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your offer. You have a $2,500 buffer before reaching your minimum acceptable price."
