,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I can meet you at $130, which is just $5 above your latest offer. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $125, just like my previous offer. Can we meet at $127.50? That's the middle ground between my previous offer and your latest one.",127.5,Bob,6,
