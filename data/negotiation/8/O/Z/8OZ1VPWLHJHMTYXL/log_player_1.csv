Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $950,000? This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
