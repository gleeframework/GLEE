"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price of $15,000**.  
* **It's worth trying to negotiate** with Alice to see if you can get a better price. 
* If negotiations fail, you can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to ensure a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget of $15,000**. 
* While it's not your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that allows you to save money compared to buying from John.
* It's likely that further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ending up paying John's price is too high."
