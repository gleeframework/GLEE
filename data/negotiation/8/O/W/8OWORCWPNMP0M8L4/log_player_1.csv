Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is still lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell at any price.

This approach allows me to potentially secure a better price than John's offer while still maintaining the flexibility to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:** While $13,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price. Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate, indicating there's room for a counteroffer. 
* **Strategic thinking:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to explore other options without closing the door completely. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, keeping in mind the need to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to ensure a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate that the product is a ""great deal"" for Bob, reminding him of its value and potential benefits.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not drastically reducing my price. This demonstrates that I value the product and am not desperate to sell. 

This approach should keep the negotiation moving forward while increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price."
