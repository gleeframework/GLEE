"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1200000, but I can also consider $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $900000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my previous offer, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000, which would be $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still aiming for a higher price, but $1000000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1100000, which would be $1025000. However, I'm also considering selling to another buyer who is willing to pay the full value of the product, so I need to be careful. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
