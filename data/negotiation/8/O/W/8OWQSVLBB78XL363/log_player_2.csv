{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing this."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1200000, but I can also consider $1100000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my previous offer, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000, which would be $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price. He still has a few rounds left and there's a chance Alice may be willing to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still aiming for a higher price, but $1,000,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1100000, which would be $1025000. However, I'm also considering selling to another buyer who is willing to pay the full value of the product, so I need to be careful. Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, $1,025,000 is still above his budget.  He has already rejected several offers from Alice, and with only a few rounds left, it is unlikely she will drop to his target price. Buying from John will save him $225,000 and ensure he gets the product within his budget."
