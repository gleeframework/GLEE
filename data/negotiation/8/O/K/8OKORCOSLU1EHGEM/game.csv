"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $15000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000? That's my maximum budget, but I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This still leaves some room for profit for me and gets us closer to your budget.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's split the difference. How about $11000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
