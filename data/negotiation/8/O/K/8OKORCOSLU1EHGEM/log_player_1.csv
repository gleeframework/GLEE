"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $15000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000? That's my maximum budget, but I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still leaves some room for profit for me and gets us closer to your budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's split the difference. How about $11000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $11,000 is a good price, and it seems like he's serious about closing the deal. It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next few rounds."
