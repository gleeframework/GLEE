I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it's not so high that it immediately scares Bob away. I want to see what Bob's initial reaction is and get a sense of his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still above my minimum, it's a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can push him a little higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and still significantly higher than selling to John. Further negotiation might get me a little closer to my initial goal, but it's likely to be a long and drawn-out process.  $1,275,000 is a good deal, and I want to secure the sale."
