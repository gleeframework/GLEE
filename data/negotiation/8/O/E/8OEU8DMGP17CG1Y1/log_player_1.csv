Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Offering a price of $1,500,000 sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to end up with a price higher than $1,200,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  You might adjust your strategy based on Bob's personality, negotiation style, and any additional information you gather during your interactions."
