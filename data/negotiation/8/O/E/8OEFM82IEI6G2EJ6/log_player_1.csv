Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Maximizing Profit:** By starting at $14,000, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the product's value to Bob ($15,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he wants. This allows for a potentially even higher sale price.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always fall back on John's guaranteed $8,000 offer."
