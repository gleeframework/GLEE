Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to try and get the highest possible price. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.  Offering it at or slightly above his valuation is unlikely to work.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency that might incentivize Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high at $1,400,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It shows we're serious but open to discussion.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob before resorting to the guaranteed offer from John."
