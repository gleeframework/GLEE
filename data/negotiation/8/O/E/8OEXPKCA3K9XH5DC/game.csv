"I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $120. I'm willing to sell it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll take the product.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $128. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $125, Alice. I'm really close to walking away from the deal and buying the product from John for $100. Can you reconsider and meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,8,
