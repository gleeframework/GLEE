"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm happy to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're close, but I still need to get as much as I can for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000, which is the same as my initial offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  To make this work for both of us, I'm offering $825,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that allows for a good profit for you, and it's the most I can realistically offer. I hope we can reach an agreement quickly.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm making a final counteroffer at this price, and I hope we can close the deal. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $850,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $835,000. This represents a significant saving for me and would still be a good profit for you. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal and move on.",835000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $835,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best we can do. I'm willing to make one final push for a higher price. I'm now offering the product to you for $860,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",860000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close to a deal. While I'm willing to meet you at a higher price point, I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. I'm offering $845,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to get a good return on the sale, and it's the highest I can realistically go at this point. Let's close this deal, and I hope we can work together in the future.",845000.0,Bob,10,
