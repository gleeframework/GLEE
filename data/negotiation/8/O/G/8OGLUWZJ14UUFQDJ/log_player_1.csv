"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $9,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, and I'm confident that he'll find the value of the product worth that price.  I'm aiming to maximize my profits while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is still better than my minimum, it's not as good as I can potentially get.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is a compromise that is still above my minimum while showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. It's a good middle ground that hopefully leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough price for me.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $8,000. This is my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept.  If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John for $8,000 to ensure I don't lose out on any profit."
