Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a strong incentive for Bob to engage in the process, as he knows he can get a good deal if he negotiates well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to Alice. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, rejecting the offer allows Alice to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering your interest and the value of the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to Alice's desired price, it's still far from her minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Rejecting the offer allows Alice to continue negotiating and try to push for a higher price. There's still potential to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,025,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
