"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. This is my final offer for now.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
