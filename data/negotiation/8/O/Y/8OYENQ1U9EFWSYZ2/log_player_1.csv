Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm not immediately going for my minimum of $100. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more, especially since he likely values the product at $80.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum of $100, it's still not enough. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground.

I'm going to see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my minimum of $100 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Showing flexibility:** By lowering my price, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.

This counteroffer hopefully shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but also that I'm not willing to give it away for too cheap.  Let's see if it works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is just $5 below my minimum of $100.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  John is offering $100, but waiting for another round with Bob could mean losing that guaranteed sale. 

While I'd prefer to sell for $100, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and is close enough to my minimum to be worthwhile."
