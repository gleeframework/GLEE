Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides leverage. It allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. It also positions the offer as a starting point, open for discussion. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome while having a safety net in place."
