Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While $145 is above Bob's perceived value, it's close enough that he might be enticed if he's truly interested in the product.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
