"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $18,000 is better than $20,000, it's still well above your budget.  Alice is willing to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $10000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still above your budget, but she is showing a willingness to negotiate. You can try one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price. There are still 5 rounds left, so you have time to work towards a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  How about $12,000?  That's a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful it's within your range.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above your budget, and you're running out of time.  You only have 3 rounds left, and it seems unlikely that Alice will come down to your desired price.  It's better to buy from John at $8,000, as that ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
