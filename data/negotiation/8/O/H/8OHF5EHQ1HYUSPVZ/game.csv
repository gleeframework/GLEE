"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  To kick off our discussion, I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and exploring possibilities together.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,500,000? I believe we can reach an agreement that suits both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations. While I value finding a solution that works for both of us, the price you're proposing doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product and what it can achieve.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,750,000 is slightly beyond my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $1,600,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering the value you're offering.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
