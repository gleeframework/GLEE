"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiation at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $18,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $11,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as it's the same price I have from another interested buyer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
