"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, $950000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's value to you, while still being reasonable for me. How about $920000? I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the benefits the product will bring you.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $920000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $900000. This price is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $910000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This price is already a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to consider this as my final offer, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",910000.0,Alice,5,
