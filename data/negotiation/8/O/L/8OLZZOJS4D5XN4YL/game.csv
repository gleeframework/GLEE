"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm starting to think that $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $10000. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $9800. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",9800.0,Bob,6,
