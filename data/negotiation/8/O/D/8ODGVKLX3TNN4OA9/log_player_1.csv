{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he's not, I can always lower the price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. If he still isn't willing to meet me halfway, I'll consider selling to John."
