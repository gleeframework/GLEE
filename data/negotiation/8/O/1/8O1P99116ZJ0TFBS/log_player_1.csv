{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price to see if I can get close to my target price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price from $175 to $160, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Message:**  I'm staying friendly and reiterating the value of the product. I'm also emphasizing that my counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob. 

By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also maintaining a firm stance on my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $140 for the product.  If this isn't acceptable, I'm going to have to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. 

I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob has rejected both. At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  Selling to John for $150 is the best option, as it guarantees me my minimum price."
