Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $19,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows you to benefit significantly while still reflecting its true worth."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the high price by emphasizing the product's ""value and potential."" This can make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate. If he's really interested, he might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle for a price higher than $15,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting your offer. You have a backup buyer, so there's no risk of losing the $15,000, but you might miss out on a higher profit if Bob walks away."
