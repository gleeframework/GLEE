"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,000,000 is better than $1,200,000, Bob can still get the product for $800,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower price than what John is offering, but he's leaving some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better price.  It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's target price.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's likely Alice won't drop much further.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John."
