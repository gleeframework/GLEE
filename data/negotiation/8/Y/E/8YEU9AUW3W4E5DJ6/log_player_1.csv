Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insight.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000) but slightly below my guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning other interested parties, I encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing what he might perceive as a valuable opportunity.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, the wording suggests I might be open to some negotiation if Bob counters."
