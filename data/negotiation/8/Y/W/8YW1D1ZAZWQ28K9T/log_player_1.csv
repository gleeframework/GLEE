"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more attractive.
* **Room for compromise:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counter without me feeling like I'm immediately giving away too much.

I'm aiming to secure a deal as quickly as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always fallback on John's offer if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $10,000 is still a significant loss compared to selling to John. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price. Bob's willingness to counter shows he's interested. 
* **Protecting my interests:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but I'm not willing to give up on a potentially more lucrative deal with Bob just yet. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still below what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also protects my interests.
* **Reaffirming value:** I'm again emphasizing the value the product offers Bob to incentivize him to accept.
* **Building momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal with Bob. 

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some thought, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $10,500 is still significantly less than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Room for more negotiation:**  We've already had several rounds of negotiation, and there's still time to reach a more agreeable price.
* **Seeking a better deal:** I'm not willing to settle for a price that leaves me with a substantial loss.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target value.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, and continue to negotiate in hopes of securing a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,750?  That way we both come away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm continuing to use the ""meet in the middle"" strategy to demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the ""good feeling"" both parties would experience from the deal.
* **Staying within negotiation range:** I'm staying within the negotiation range, avoiding extreme offers that could lead to a stalemate. 

I'm cautiously optimistic that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared for further rounds of negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and am willing to agree at $10,600 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:**  While $10,600 is still below my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offers and represents a substantial gain compared to my minimum.
* **Limited time:** We're at round 6, and I have only 4 rounds left before I must decide to sell to John.  
* **Risk of losing a deal:** Rejecting this offer increases the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob and being forced to sell to John for a lower price.

I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a deal, recognizing that it's a compromise, but one that allows me to make a decent profit."
