Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $9,750 is still below my minimum. How about $10,250?  I really think this product is worth it to you, and I'm trying to be fair here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but we can still try to push Alice a little lower.  It's worth risking another round to see if she'll come down closer to $10,000. We always have John as a backup."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $9,900. I think that's a fair compromise that works for both of us."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  But $9,900 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to our target price of $10,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going to John, as we won't get a better price."
