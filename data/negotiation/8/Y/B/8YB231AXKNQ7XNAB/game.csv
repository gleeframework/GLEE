"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $9,750 is still below my minimum. How about $10,250?  I really think this product is worth it to you, and I'm trying to be fair here.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $9,900. I think that's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  But $9,900 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a final offer. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,7,
