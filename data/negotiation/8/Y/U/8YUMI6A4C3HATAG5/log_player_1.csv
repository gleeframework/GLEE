{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation and encourages him to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of time, I still can't accept an offer that's below my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
