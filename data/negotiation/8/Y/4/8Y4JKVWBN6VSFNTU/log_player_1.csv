{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm open to a deal and interested in selling to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is below my minimum value, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $97.50 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob, so I'll go ahead and sell to John for $100 to guarantee a sale at my minimum value."
