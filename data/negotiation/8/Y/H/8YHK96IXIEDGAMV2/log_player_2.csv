"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you, but I understand it's a substantial investment.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a price I'm comfortable with, but I'm open to discussing it further if you're interested.  If this isn't right for you, I have another buyer lined up, but I truly believe this product could be something special for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
