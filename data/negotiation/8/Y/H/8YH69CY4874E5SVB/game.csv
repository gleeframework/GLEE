"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $90. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Can you consider $98? I really think we can meet in the middle.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $109. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $109 is still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $105? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can make a deal at this price.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can see you're willing to meet me at $105, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer it to you for $108. Let's see if we can get a little closer to a deal.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Alice. I can do $106, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Can you meet me at this price?",106.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $106, but I'm going to throw in a small concession. I can offer it to you for $107. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",107.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $105, that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll make the deal.",105.0,Bob,10,
