"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $120 when you can get the product for $100 from John.  It's best to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it reflects the fact that I can get the product elsewhere for $100.  Hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still too high. While $110 is better than her initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $95. This is still a good deal for Alice, as she can get the product for $100 elsewhere. I'm hoping that she'll recognize the value of closing the deal and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better price. John's offer is still available, and it gives me a baseline to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $98. This is a very fair price, considering that Alice can sell it to John for $100.  Hopefully, she'll see that this is a good deal for her and accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still not worth it to me. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $100. This is the best option for me at this point, as I've already spent several rounds negotiating and haven't been able to get a lower price from Alice."
