"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,800,000 is tempting, I'm confident this product will bring you even more value. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
