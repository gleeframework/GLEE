"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This would still leave you with a good profit and allow me to make a worthwhile purchase. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a chance to make a profitable deal. Let's try to find some common ground here!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement here.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to drop to $1,325,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the product's value to you while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with this offer. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
