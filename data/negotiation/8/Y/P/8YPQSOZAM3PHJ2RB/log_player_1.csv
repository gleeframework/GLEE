Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's enticing but leaves room for profit.
* **Negotiation:** The message frames the price as a ""pre-listing"" offer, suggesting potential competition and scarcity to encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **""John"" as Leverage:** While not explicitly mentioned, the presence of John (willing to pay $12,000) gives Alice a strong fallback position. 

By starting at $11,500, Alice leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit if he accepts outright."
