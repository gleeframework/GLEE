Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's also significantly less than the $120 I could get from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also keeps me closer to my goal of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even lower than the $100 the product is worth to Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still not ideal. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and attempt one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  How about $100? It's fair to both of us, and we can finally make this deal happen.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
