"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  However, I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay this much.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if he's interested in a higher price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is far too low for me. It's less than my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe this product is worth a significant amount. I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm coming down slightly again, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise and might be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is tempting, it's still slightly below my minimum.  I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can push for a higher price. It's possible Bob is close to his limit and might be willing to budge just a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $14,500.  This is a small compromise, but it's a price that is still above my minimum and might convince Bob to close the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
