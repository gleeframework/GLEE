Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $110 price leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still ensuring a significant gain for me.
* **Above my Minimum:** This offer is well above my minimum acceptable price ($80), ensuring I'm always making a profit.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage and confidence to aim high with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $95?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $95 is a profit, it's significantly below my initial asking price and leaves a lot of potential money on the table.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's rejection wasn't a hard ""no,"" suggesting he's still interested. There's space to negotiate a better deal. 
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $102? That's a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 102
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price significantly higher than his offer. 
* **Strong Justification:**  By framing it as a ""fair price"" and ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm appealing to a sense of compromise and reason. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:** $102 still provides a healthy profit margin while leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $102 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $98. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  While not ideal, $98 is still a good profit margin ($18) and close to my previous counter-offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might alienate Bob or result in minimal gains.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  My time has value. Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other potential sales and avoid prolonged negotiations."
