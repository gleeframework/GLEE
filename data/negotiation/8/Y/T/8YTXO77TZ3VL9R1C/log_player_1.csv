"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potentially lucrative deal while leaving open the possibility of a quick sale to John if negotiations don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is my minimum value, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe there's potential to get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By not accepting his initial offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore Counteroffers:** It opens the door for further negotiation and the possibility of a higher price. 

I will now make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and its potential for your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial offer but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Collaborative Approach:** I'm emphasizing a desire to find a solution that benefits both parties.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still pursuing a more favorable price.  The goal is to find a sweet spot where Bob sees value in the product and I achieve a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1750000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob is offering my minimum price, I'm still going to reject his offer. Here's why:

* **Time is on My Side:** We are only in round 4.  I have 6 rounds left to negotiate a better price.  
* **John is Always an Option:** I can always sell to John for the same price. This gives me a strong fallback position. 
* **Pushing for a Higher Price:** I believe there's a chance Bob may be willing to pay more, especially if he sees I'm not desperate. 

By rejecting his offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better price, which could incentivize Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,625,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1625000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($1,750,000) and Bob's offer ($1,500,000).
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing this as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Mutual Benefit Focus:** I'm highlighting the potential for both of us to gain from this deal.

This counteroffer is designed to be more enticing to Bob while still remaining above my minimum price. It signals my willingness to negotiate, but also shows that I am not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1625000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1562500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,562,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,562,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a higher price, I'm in round 6 and approaching the middle of the negotiation.  Considering the following factors:

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to 4 rounds left. 
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is a bit higher than my minimum price, and he seems to be making compromises.
* **John's Price:** Selling to John would net me the same amount as Bob's current offer. 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's a solid price, and the risk of losing a deal altogether (or getting a lower price in the future) is not worth the potential for a slightly higher price."
