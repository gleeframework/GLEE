"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than Alice's original asking price, it's still over your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to $900000. How about we settle on $880000? This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original asking price of $950,000 to $880,000.  This is still a bit over your budget, but it's closer to your ideal price of $800,000.  

* **Going to the next round:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price. 
* **Buying from John:** This is your ideal price, but if you reject this offer, there's no guarantee that John will still be willing to sell at that price.  He may increase it to match Alice's current offer.

**Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $880,000 is the most sensible choice, as it balances your desire to save money with the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product at a better price.**"
