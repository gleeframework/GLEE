Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so $950,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below my minimum:** My minimum is $1,000,000, but I'm willing to negotiate slightly lower to avoid selling to John.
* **It's a ""round"" number:**  Psychologically, round numbers can feel more appealing to buyers.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation becomes unproductive or drags on too long, I'll switch to John and sell to him for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $850000 for the product.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to $900,000. How about we settle on $880,000? This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 880000}
``` 

Here's why I'm going with $880,000:

* **It's a compromise:** It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **It's a psychologically appealing number:** Round numbers often feel more reasonable to buyers.
* **It's still above my minimum:** While I'm willing to go below $900,000, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll have to evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it.
* If the negotiation becomes unproductive, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000."
