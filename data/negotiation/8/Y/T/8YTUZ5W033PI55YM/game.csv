"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to $900000. How about we settle on $880000? This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",880000.0,Alice,3,
