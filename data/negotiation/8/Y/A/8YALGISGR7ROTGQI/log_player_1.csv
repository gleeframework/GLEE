Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $130. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is above my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Addressing Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the fact that the product is worth $150 to him, suggesting a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counteroffer if he finds the price too high. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** Bob's offer of $120 is still above my minimum value of $100. 
* **Potential for better:** There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired $130 price point by counteroffering.
* **Avoiding the risk:** Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's less than what I can potentially earn by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering $125, which is right in the middle of my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $120. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing that this price would make ""both of us happy,"" highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Remaining firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still above my minimum value, ensuring I don't settle for too low of a price. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, keeping the negotiation going while moving closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $122? That's the closest I can get to your original offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** Bob's offer of $122 is just $3 away from my desired $125. This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject, there's a risk Bob might become less interested or even walk away. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher price, but it also carries the risk of losing the sale altogether.  

Given that Bob's offer is close to what I'm willing to accept, I'm choosing to take the deal and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation."
