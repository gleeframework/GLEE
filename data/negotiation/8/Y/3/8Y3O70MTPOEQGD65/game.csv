"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is considerably lower than what I'm looking for.  Could you do $12,000? I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you at that price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
