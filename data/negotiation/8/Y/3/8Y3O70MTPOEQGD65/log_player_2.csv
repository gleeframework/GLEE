"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm initially offering it for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is significantly above your budget. You should make a counteroffer significantly lower to start negotiating towards a price you're willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's asking price, but it's still within a reasonable negotiation range. It gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is considerably lower than what I'm looking for.  Could you do $12,000? I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down in price, but it's still above your budget. You should continue negotiating, moving closer to your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You're moving closer to Alice's price.
* **Sets a firm limit:** You're stating that $10,000 is your absolute maximum. This lets Alice know you're serious. 
* **Avoids a stalemate:** By meeting in the middle, you increase the chances of reaching an agreement quickly."
