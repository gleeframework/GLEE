"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a significant amount to me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice."
