"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000 to acknowledge your enthusiasm.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",750000.0,Alice,3,
