"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? It's a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
