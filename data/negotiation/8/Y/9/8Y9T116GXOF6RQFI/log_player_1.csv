"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is a good price, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I hope this will encourage Bob to accept, as it's still a good deal for him, but also closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a deal. If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13200}
```

I'm going to offer $13,200. This is a bit of a compromise, but it's still a good deal for me, and I hope it will be enough to convince Bob to accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll go ahead and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I've already made a few concessions and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher price. It's better to secure the deal with John and avoid further risk of losing out on the sale."
