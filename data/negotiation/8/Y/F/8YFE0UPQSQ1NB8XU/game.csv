"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider adjusting your price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $10,000 is a fair price for the product, it's a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  This would allow me to make a fair profit, while still giving you a great deal on a valuable product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still committed to finding a fair price for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,4,
