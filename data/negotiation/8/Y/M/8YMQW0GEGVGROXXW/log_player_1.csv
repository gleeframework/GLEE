Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though you know Bob values it at $1,200,000.
* **Alternative:** You have a safety net with John, guaranteeing you'll get at least $1,200,000. This allows you to be bolder in your offer to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  You don't know how much Bob is willing to pay *above* his perceived value. He might be willing to negotiate up if he sees the product as highly valuable.
* **Risk Tolerance:** A higher offer carries the risk of Bob immediately rejecting it. However, it also has the potential for a much higher reward."
