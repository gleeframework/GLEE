"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $125 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $125 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. If you reject Alice's offer, she might come back with a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
