Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $10,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go down to $10,000 at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While he's getting closer, I'm still not at a price I'm comfortable with. I have a few more rounds left, and I'm hoping to secure a deal closer to my minimum of $12,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10750}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's clear that Bob is not willing to go much higher, and I've already gone down quite a bit from my initial asking price. I'd rather sell to John and get my desired price than continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
