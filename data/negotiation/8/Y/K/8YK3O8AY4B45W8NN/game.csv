"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go down to $10,000 at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would allow me to make some profit and you to get a fantastic product for a fair price.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.  Let me know your thoughts!",10750.0,Alice,5,
