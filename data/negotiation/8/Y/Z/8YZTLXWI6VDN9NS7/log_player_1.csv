Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and my other potential buyers, I'm willing to part with it for $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she needs to aim higher with Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product at $11,500 creates a win-win situation if Bob is price-sensitive. Bob gets a $500 discount from its perceived value, and Alice makes $1,500 more than selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, the message leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. Alice can then decide if she wants to go slightly lower or hold firm."
