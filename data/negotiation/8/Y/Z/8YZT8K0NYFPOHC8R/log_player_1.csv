Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a steal for what it's worth to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair price:** You are offering the product at its true value to Bob, giving him no incentive to immediately reject the offer.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** It establishes the value of the product and sets the stage for potential negotiations.
* **It leaves room for bargaining:**  There's no pressure for Bob to accept immediately, but he also knows you are serious about selling.

However, remember: 

* This is a *starting point.*  You may need to adjust your price depending on Bob's response.
* Don't be afraid to stop the negotiation and sell to John if Bob becomes unreasonable."
