Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,500 as possible, as this is the maximum Bob would theoretically pay before finding it more beneficial to buy at his valuation of $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a good deal for Alice. 
* **Time Value:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. By offering it to Bob slightly lower, she might save time and effort associated with finding another buyer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product."
