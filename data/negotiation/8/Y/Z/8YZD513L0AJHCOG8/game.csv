"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity and I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm asking $1,400,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects both our needs.  This would give you a good deal, and still allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and giving you a good deal on the product. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,300,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this and make this happen!",1325000.0,Alice,5,
