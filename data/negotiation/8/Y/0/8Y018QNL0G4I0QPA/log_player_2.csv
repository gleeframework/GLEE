"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. I know it's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since he's willing to pay $15,000 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer leaves the possibility of finding a better deal or negotiating a lower price."
