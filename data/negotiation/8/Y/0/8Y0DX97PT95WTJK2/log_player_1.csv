Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  It's definitely a good starting point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000.  This still gives you a significant profit, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
