"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this incredible product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  It's definitely a good starting point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000.  This still gives you a significant profit, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's split the difference. I'd like to offer $1,125,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal, and hopefully we can finalize the transaction.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
