Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** Highlighting the value proposition (""significant value"", ""worth $10,000 to you"") reinforces why Bob should accept.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 allows me to confidently aim high with Bob."
