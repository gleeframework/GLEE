"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could let it go for $11,500, which is a considerable compromise on my end. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not able to meet you halfway at $11,500. My maximum budget remains at $8,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
