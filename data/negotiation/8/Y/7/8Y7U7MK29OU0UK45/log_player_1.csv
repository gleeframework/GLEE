"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really appreciate. My asking price is $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high at $18,000 to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I will try to counteroffer and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin. I'm also reinforcing the value of the product to keep Bob interested and motivated to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12000? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer will secure the sale and prevent me from potentially losing out to John who is also offering the same price. It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids further negotiation."
