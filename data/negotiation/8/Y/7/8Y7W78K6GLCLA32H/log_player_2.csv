It's too expensive at $120, and you can get it from John for $80.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a lower offer of $70. It's still below your maximum of $80, and hopefully, it's a reasonable starting point for Alice."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is still asking for too much, and we are at the 7th round of negotiation. It's getting late, and you need to make a decision. You're willing to pay $80 for this product, and John is offering it to you for that price. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
