"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to offer it for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a good home for the product, $10,050 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $11,750?"", ""product_price"": 11750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,750 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,750, which would be $11,125. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving towards a price I find acceptable. Waiting any longer carries the risk of him lowering his offer or me pushing him away. Accepting $11,125 is a strong profit above my minimum."
