"I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10050.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a good home for the product, $10,050 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,750 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,750, which would be $11,125. Can we meet at this price?",11125.0,Bob,4,
