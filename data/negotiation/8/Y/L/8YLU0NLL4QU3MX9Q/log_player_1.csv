Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll go above $12,000. It makes more financial sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
