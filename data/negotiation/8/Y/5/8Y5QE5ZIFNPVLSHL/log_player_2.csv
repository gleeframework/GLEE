Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it doesn't fully reflect the product's value. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment. I propose a price of $1,050,000.  This price is still significantly below my initial offer, allowing you a considerable profit while ensuring I achieve a fair value for the product.
