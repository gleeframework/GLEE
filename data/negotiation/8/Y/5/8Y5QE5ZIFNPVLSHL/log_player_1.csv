Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This amount aligns more closely with what I am able to invest while still allowing me to acquire the product. I look forward to your response.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
