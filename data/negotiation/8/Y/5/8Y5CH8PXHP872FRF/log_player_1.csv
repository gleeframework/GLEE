Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm eager to close the deal, $1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the following rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This reflects a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not where I need it to be. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
