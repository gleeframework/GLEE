Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it.  This is my best offer, as I'm happy to purchase the product from another seller for a similar price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
