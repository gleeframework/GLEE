"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1000000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it.  This is my best offer, as I'm happy to purchase the product from another seller for a similar price.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $925000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the market price. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price considering I can get a very similar product from John for $800000.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $900000, so I'm counteroffering $912500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the market price. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
