"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1000000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is above his budget. He can get a better deal from John or try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

This is my best offer, as I'm happy to purchase the product from another seller for a similar price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $925000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the market price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still higher than Bob's target. Bob should reject this offer and counter again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $900000, so I'm counteroffering $912500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the market price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even though Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it is still above Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's better for Bob to secure the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
