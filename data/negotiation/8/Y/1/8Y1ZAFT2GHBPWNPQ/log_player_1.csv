Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your portfolio. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $800,000. It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value of the product to Bob. It encourages him to respond and engage in negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, I've achieved a successful sale.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll analyze it and decide whether to accept or counter with a new offer. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or don't lead to a favorable outcome, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for you to make a sale. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get a better price. I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can reach a compromise that works for both of us. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  How about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This is a compromise price that is halfway between my original offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be flexible and show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I also want to remind him of the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response.  If he accepts, I'll have achieved a successful sale.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  If he makes another counteroffer, I'll analyze it and decide whether to accept or counter again.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I'll sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about $1050000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and it's significantly higher than John's offer. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can't get a much better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This is a good outcome, as I've secured a price that is more than John's offer, and I've managed to complete the sale without going through further negotiation rounds."
