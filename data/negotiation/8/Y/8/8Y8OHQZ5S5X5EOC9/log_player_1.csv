Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while still potentially leaving room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, he may be willing to pay a bit more to secure it, but I'm not going to give it away for less than I consider it worth.  I'm also keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower to acknowledge Bob's rejection. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my offer to $1,100,000.  It's a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to make him reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time, but if he rejects it, I'm selling to John.  I'm willing to walk away to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is my final offer to Bob.  I'm dropping the price again, showing I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm not going any lower.  If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John, as I'm confident I can get a better price with him."
