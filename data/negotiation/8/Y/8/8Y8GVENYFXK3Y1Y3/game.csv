"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to my business.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth.",800000.0,Alice,5,
