"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept a deal that loses me money. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired amount. I still have time and can leverage the possibility of selling to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by coming down slightly from my initial offer.  I'm still above Bob's current offer, but I'm hoping that my willingness to compromise will encourage him to meet me halfway.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,750 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not going to lose money on this deal. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  If I can't reach a deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for $12,000, which is a much more desirable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal.  However, $10,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good outcome.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm sticking to my principles of not going below $12,000. However, I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming closer to Bob's offer. I'm also highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the benefits of a deal for both of us. My goal is to convince Bob that $11,250 is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below $12,000. I've only got four rounds left, and I'm not sure if I can get Bob to agree to my desired price. It's better to be safe than sorry. I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John and avoid the risk of losing money with Bob."
