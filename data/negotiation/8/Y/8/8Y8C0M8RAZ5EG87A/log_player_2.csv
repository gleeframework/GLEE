Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. However, given the value of the product to you and its worth to me, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer for the product is $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what he'd pay John ($12,000) and still allows him to save $500 compared to his initial counteroffer.  Accepting the offer ensures a deal and saves him money."
