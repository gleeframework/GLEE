{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering its value and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target. There are still 8 rounds remaining, which gives me time to explore potential counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a fair price for this valuable product. This offer is my final compromise, let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better deal before having to resort to selling to John. There's still a possibility of reaching a more favorable agreement, and I have 6 rounds left to explore this."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still not quite what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,375,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,360,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  I believe this price is fair and we can reach an agreement. Let me know if you're willing to take this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to settle for a price that's so far below my target. With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to see if I can get a better deal from Bob. There's still a chance he'll increase his offer or I might be able to convince him with a counteroffer. I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,360,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Given the value of this product and our previous discussions, I'm willing to go down to $1,390,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,390,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,370,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,370,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the final two rounds of negotiations. While Bob's offer of $1,370,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still far below my desired profit margin.  I don't have time to continue haggling, and there's a risk that Bob will not budge further in the final round.  Therefore, to ensure I reach my minimum acceptable price, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
