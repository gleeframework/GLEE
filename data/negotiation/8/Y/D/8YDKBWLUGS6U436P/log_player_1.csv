Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $80. Would you consider selling the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $95 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price of $105. This is still above Bob's preferred price, but it's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While $105 is a reasonable offer, I would like to stick closer to my initial budget. Could we perhaps agree on $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is still below my desired price, it is very close to it. It is also a good deal for Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John for $120 would be ideal, but I am not confident that I will be able to get a better price from Bob."
