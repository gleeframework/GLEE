Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position, allowing her to be more confident in her pricing with Bob."
