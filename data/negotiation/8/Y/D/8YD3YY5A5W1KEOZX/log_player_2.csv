"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $14,000.** This is within your budget of $15,000 but still leaves you with a profit if you buy from John for $15,000.
* **John's price is $15,000.**  You can always go to John if Alice's offer is too high.
* **Goal:** Your goal is to save money.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you are positioning yourself to negotiate a better price or purchase from John, maximizing your savings."
