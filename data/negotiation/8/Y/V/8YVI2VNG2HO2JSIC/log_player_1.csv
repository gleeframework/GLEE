# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering your product. I appreciate the quality and uniqueness, but my budget allows me to only spend up to $100 for it. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.
