"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're willing to accept.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I'm afraid $950000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering a new price of $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. However, I still feel that the product's value doesn't justify the full $1100000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I hope this offers a more balanced solution for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
