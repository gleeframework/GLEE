"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $12,000. Alice is offering the product at $12,000. This means you're getting no discount.  Since John will also sell you the product for $12,000, you might as well reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better deal from someone else later."
