"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to earn a profit.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm still confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I think it might be enough to entice Bob to come closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to compromise a little bit, but I'm not going to give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. Although it's still below my minimum, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob entirely and having to sell to John for $12,000. I'm confident I can make up for the difference through other means."
