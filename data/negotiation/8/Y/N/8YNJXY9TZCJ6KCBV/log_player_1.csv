Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still keeping Alice comfortably above her minimum.
* **Time Value:** While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit. This offer emphasizes that opportunity."
