"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $850000.  It's still too far below the value I need to get. How about we split the difference at $900000?  This is a fair compromise that still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations.  While I value our ongoing negotiation, I'm only able to accept a price closer to my previous offer.  How about $890000? This is a small adjustment from my last offer and would still represent a good deal for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
