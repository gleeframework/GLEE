Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects my desire for a mutually beneficial transaction."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower initially with Bob allows us to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a strong offer, surpassing Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This makes it more enticing for him to accept. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer doesn't start at our absolute minimum, leaving space for potential counter-offers from Bob if he's particularly interested.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, the chosen strategy balances risk and potential reward effectively."
