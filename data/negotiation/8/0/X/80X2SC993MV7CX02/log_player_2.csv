"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating further to try to get a better price. There's also the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, which is a good fallback option if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a good middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to come down to $1075000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his desired price point.  Since Bob has 7 rounds left, there's room for further negotiation and a potential for Alice to come down further.  It's also important to note that if the negotiation fails, Bob can always go with John's offer for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm eager to acquire the product, $1,075,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,025,000.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price point."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, but I need you to meet me at that price. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget, and it's only $50,000 more than the price John is offering. Considering there are only 5 rounds left, it's a good idea to accept the offer and secure the product."
