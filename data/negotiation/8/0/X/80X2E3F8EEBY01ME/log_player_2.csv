# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting, you can likely get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $80, and John is offering it for that price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $95 is closer to your target price, you can still potentially get a better deal.  John is offering the product for $80, and you have some leverage to negotiate with Alice further."
