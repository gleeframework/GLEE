{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a starting point. By offering $110, I'm aiming for a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more than the $120 from John, while still being reasonable enough to entice Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $85?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I need to push for a higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $95, but I'm willing to go to $90.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good investment for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my desired range and is still a good deal for me compared to selling to John for $120. It's time to accept his offer and close the deal."
