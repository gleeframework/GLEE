Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be greatly beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000,  we don't want to start too low. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation, especially if the product is presented well. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $20,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This knowledge gives us leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
