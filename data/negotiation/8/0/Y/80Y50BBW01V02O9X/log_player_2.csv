"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a significant gap between Alice's asking price and what John is offering. By negotiating, you might be able to get the price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes your position and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John will sell at $1,000,000 gives you leverage. While you don't want to reveal this immediately, your offer implies you have other options.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message maintains a polite and professional tone while clearly stating your price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to your desired range, but there's still room for negotiation. The difference between her offer and John's price is now $100,000. By continuing to negotiate, you might be able to bridge this gap or at least secure a better deal than $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to compromise and move closer to Alice's price point. 
* **Midpoint:** By suggesting $1,050,000, you're splitting the difference between your last offer ($900,000) and her current one ($1,100,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While not explicitly stating it, this offer implies you're getting closer to your walk-away point. This might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale."
