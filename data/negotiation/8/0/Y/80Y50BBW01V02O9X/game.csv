"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
