Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message implies it's valuable by mentioning a ""pre-public listing"" opportunity.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price above your minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, so there's less risk in aiming higher with Bob."
