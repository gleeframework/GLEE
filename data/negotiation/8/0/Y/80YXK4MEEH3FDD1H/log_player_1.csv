I'm starting with a high price, $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's important to remember that I have a floor price of $1,200,000, as I can always sell to John for that amount. By starting high, I maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still above my floor price. It makes sense to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,700,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, but still closer to my desired price. I hope this will be acceptable to him, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my floor price, but it's still not where I want it to be. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm offering $1,650,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise and hopefully will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my floor price. I don't want to risk going lower and potentially selling for less than I can get from John. I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,200,000."
