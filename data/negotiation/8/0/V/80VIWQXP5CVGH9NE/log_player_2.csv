"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. $11,500 is still a good price for him, considering he's willing to pay up to $15,000.  It's a better deal than buying from John and a good compromise with Alice."
