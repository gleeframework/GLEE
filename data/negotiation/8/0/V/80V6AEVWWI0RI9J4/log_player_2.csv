Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to make one last push to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's clear Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,325,000.  While we could try one more counter-offer, it's risky. If we fail to get the price down in the next round, we're stuck either paying Alice's price or John's price, both of which are worse than John's current offer. 

Buying from John for $1,500,000 guarantees we stay within our budget, even if it means missing a slightly better deal with Alice."
