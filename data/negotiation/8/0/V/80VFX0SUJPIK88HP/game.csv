"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $87.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $82.50 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and I offer you the product for $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",85.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $85. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Can you consider that?",80.0,Bob,6,
