Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob automatically walks away.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stated, the phrase ""unique value and potential"" subtly implies the price is warranted.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher. 
* **Time Constraints:**  If you're on a tight deadline, a lower initial offer might speed up the process. 

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response."
