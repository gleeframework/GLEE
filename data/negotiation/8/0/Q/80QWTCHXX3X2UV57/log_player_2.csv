"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to my target price. It acknowledges Alice's offer but proposes a significant reduction while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $12,000. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above my target.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $8,900? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8900
}
```

This counteroffer continues the negotiation by suggesting a price slightly below Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
