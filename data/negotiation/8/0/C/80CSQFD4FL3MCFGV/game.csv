"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $80.50. It's my lowest price, and I think it's a great deal. What do you think?",80.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $80.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $77 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",77.0,Bob,6,
