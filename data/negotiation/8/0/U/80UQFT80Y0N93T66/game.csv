"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $150? ",150.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $165? It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $150.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price? ",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're serious about buying the product, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my next move. How about we try $160? It's a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $150.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand you need to make a profit, I'm still only able to go up to $155.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $150. Would you be willing to accept it?",155.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $162.50? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",162.5,Alice,7,
