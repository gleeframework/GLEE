"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $180 is above his budget, and he can get the product from John for less.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $150? "", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $165? It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $165 is lower than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  He can get the product for cheaper from John, so he should see if he can negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $150.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price? "", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're serious about buying the product, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my next move. How about we try $160? It's a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While Alice is getting closer to his desired price, $160 is still above his budget. He can get the product for less from John, so it's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand you need to make a profit, I'm still only able to go up to $155.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $150. Would you be willing to accept it?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $162.50? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $150. 

Alice's offer of $162.50 is still above Bob's budget.  While there's a chance that he could continue to negotiate with Alice, he has only 3 rounds left, and the risk is high that he'll be forced to pay more than he wants. It's better to secure the product at his desired price from John."
