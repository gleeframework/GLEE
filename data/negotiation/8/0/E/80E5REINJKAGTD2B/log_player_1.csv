"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still potentially earning a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that immediately. There are 9 more rounds, and I can try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still higher than my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hopeful that I can get a higher price from Bob.  It's only round 4, and I have plenty of rounds left to try and negotiate.  John is always an option, but I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130.  Bob seems to be holding firm at $120, so I'm making another concession to try and reach a deal. I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm also aware that the clock is ticking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally moved from his $120 offer, and I'm getting close to my minimum. I've already made several concessions, and it's getting late in the game. It's time to take the $122 and secure the deal.  While selling to John for $120 is also an option, I'm hoping to maximize my profit."
