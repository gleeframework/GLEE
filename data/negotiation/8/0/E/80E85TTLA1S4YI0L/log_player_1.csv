Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product for Bob. This can help him feel more inclined to accept the offer.

**Why this is a good starting point:**

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can still lower my price a bit, but I haven't given away too much right away.
* **Potential for quick deal:** If Bob is willing to pay a little extra for the product, we might reach an agreement quickly.
* **Good backup option:** If negotiations stall, I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than what he values the product at.  Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss for me. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal considering the value this product holds. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counter-offering with $10,000. This is still a good deal for Bob since he values the product at $10,000.
* **Message:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob by acknowledging his offer and expressing my willingness to compromise. I'm also reminding him of the value of the product. 

This counteroffer strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  It's a compromise between my desired price and Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Increase chances of closing the deal:**  $10,000 is a fair price for both of us, making it more likely that Bob will accept."
