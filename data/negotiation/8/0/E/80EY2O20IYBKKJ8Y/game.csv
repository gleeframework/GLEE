"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll find worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering we're both getting closer to our desired price.  Let's make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
