"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be useful, $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we agree on $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
