Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently shown a pattern of splitting the difference in negotiations.  He's unlikely to significantly deviate from this pattern. At this point, he's maximizing his gain while keeping you far from your target. It's highly improbable that he'll offer anything close to $1,000,000.  Therefore, accepting John's offer guarantees the desired profit without further risk or wasted negotiation rounds."
