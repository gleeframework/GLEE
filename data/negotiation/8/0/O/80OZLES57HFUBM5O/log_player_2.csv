"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a living. I can do $160, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and I pay $135?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $152.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $152.50.  Since you have the option to buy from John at $150, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings and buy from John."
