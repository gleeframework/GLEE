"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I could consider a price of $875,000. This offer reflects a more realistic valuation.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about $760,000? That's a significant investment on my part.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to come down slightly to $840,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",840000.0,Alice,5,
