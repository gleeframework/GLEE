Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I could consider a price of $875,000. This offer reflects a more realistic valuation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to come down slightly to $840,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While I could counter again, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is too high. Accepting at $840,000 secures a reasonable price."
