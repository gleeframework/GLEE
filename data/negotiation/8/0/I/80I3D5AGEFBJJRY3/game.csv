"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's closer to the value I need to receive.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to meet in that range?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This is a significant compromise, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
