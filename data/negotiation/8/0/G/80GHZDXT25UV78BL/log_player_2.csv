"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the high value I see in it for someone like yourself. I trust it will provide significant value to you, considering its worth to me is over $100. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is above your maximum budget of $80. You know you can get the product for $80 from John.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
