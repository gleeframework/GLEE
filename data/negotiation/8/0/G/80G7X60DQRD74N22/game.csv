"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price I'm confident you'll find attractive. I'm sure you understand that I'm not going to reveal the exact value of the product to you just yet. However, I can assure you it's worth significantly more than $1200000 to me, which is what I could easily sell it for elsewhere.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This represents a substantial opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the potential value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
