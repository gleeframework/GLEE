"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There are still rounds left, so Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows his maximum budget is $8,000. By offering this price, he's clearly stating his limit and hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate down to meet it. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a quick and decisive negotiation. If Alice rejects, Bob knows he can still purchase from John for his maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He has more rounds to negotiate and can still fall back on buying from John for $8,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the pressure on her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. By offering $9,000, he's signaling to Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's not going to overpay. If Alice rejects, Bob has the option to buy from John, but this offer puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision quickly."
