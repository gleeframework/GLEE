"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer and counteroffer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so it's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if she'll come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000 for the product. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your concerns about the price.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for a lower price from John. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if she'll come down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I think $1,300,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

Alice has stated that $1,320,000 is her final offer. While this is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he can get from John. Given that John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and save $120,000."
