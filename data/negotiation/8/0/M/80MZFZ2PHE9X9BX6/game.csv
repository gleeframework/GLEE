"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and provides a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000 for the product. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your concerns about the price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can close this out.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I think $1,300,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
