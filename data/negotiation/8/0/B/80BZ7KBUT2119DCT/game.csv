"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $7500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7250. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",7250.0,Alice,3,
