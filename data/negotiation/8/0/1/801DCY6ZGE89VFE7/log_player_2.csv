"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $160. 
* This is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay. 
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* While $140 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. 
*  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down in price. If not, he can always purchase from John for $120."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* At this point, Alice's offer of $135 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.
* It's not clear if Alice will come down any further in price, and continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming.
* Buying from John for $120 guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price, avoiding any further negotiation."
