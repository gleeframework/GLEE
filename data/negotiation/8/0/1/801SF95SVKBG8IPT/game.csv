"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $950,000 is too high for me.  How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer. However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle on $725,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $725,000 is still a little too low for me.  I understand you have budget constraints, but  I'm willing to go down to $800,000 as a final offer. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value to you, and it's also my minimum acceptable price.  Let's make this deal happen!",800000.0,Alice,5,
