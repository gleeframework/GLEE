Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's less than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, allowing room for potential negotiation.
* **It demonstrates flexibility:**  The message shows you're open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest while keeping the door open for a higher price or a sale to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer, I can potentially get closer to my desired $1,000,000 or even higher. Selling to John right now would secure a good price, but it might be worth exploring if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows a willingness to compromise:** It's a slight increase from Bob's offer, indicating flexibility.
* **Stays above your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Provides a clear reason:**  It justifies the price with the product's value and the need for a win-win situation.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob while still securing a price closer to your goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $925,000 is getting closer to my goal, it's still not the price I'm hoping for.  The negotiations are becoming more time-consuming, and I don't want to risk Bob continually lowering his offers.  Selling to John right now guarantees me my desired minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring a quick and profitable sale."
