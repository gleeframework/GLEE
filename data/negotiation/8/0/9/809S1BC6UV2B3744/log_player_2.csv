Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $950000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  I believe this is a fair compromise.
