"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
