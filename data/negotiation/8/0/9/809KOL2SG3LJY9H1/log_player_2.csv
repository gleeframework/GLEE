# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is below his maximum budget and a better deal than Alice's offer."
