Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profits.  However, I'm aware that this might be too high for Bob, so I'm prepared to negotiate.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on how close it is to my minimum value of $15,000.  If necessary, I'll counter his offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still aiming for a profitable sale.  I'll always keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I am not willing to sell the product at such a low price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $17,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but a significant drop from my initial price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm about not selling for anything close to his initial offer. This is a compromise, and I hope Bob sees the value in my product and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not willing to settle for $13,000. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to reach a compromise that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $16,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product to me. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my previous counteroffer. I hope Bob sees this as a genuine attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
