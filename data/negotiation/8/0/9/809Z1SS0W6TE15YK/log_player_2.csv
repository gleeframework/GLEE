"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100

This counter-offer attempts to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results, and it risks losing the deal entirely."
