Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum.**  This leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a possible deal that benefits both of you.
* **It's a clear and concise offer.** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to.
* **It includes a friendly message.** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Let me know if you'd like to adjust the price or the message. I'm ready to help you get the best deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 just isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm aiming for a compromise by offering $95. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation, making it more appealing than my previous offer.  It also demonstrates a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go that low.  It's better to sell to John for $120 and secure a profit that meets my minimum requirements."
