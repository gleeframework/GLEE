"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $850,000, which is a fair reflection of its value. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for $800,000.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of you. She claims the product is worth $800,000 to you but is trying to sell it for more. Her statement about another buyer is likely a bluff. You know John will sell it to you for $800,000, making that the better option."
