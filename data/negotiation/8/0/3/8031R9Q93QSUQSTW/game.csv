"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I believe your product is of high quality, the price is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950,000.

This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
