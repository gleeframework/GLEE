"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know it's worth even more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**
