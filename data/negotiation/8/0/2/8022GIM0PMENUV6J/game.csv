"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to come down to $12,000. This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still outside my budget. My final offer is $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it now. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.
