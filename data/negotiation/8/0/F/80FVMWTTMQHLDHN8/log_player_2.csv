"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for something worth that much to you!  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product, and Alice is offering it at the same price, there's no benefit in accepting her offer.  You can get the same product from John for the same price."
