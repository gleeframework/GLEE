"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1050000, which is $1100000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1100000, but I need to be confident that it's a price that works for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
