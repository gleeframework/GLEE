Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $650,000 to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is a fair price for this product. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $750,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while I'd prefer a lower price,  $750,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer saves a significant amount of money."
