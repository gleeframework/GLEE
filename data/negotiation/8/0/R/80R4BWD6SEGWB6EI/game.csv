"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500. What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming back with a number. To be honest, $6,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I could be convinced to let it go for $10,500. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand where you're coming from. While $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
