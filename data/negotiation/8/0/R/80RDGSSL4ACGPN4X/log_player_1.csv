Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still believe $1,200,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $1,200,000.  While this is my absolute floor, I still have room to negotiate and John's offer provides a safety net.  I'll try one more time to nudge Bob upwards before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I value your decisiveness, but I need you to understand that this product is priced at a premium for a reason. $1,250,000 is my final offer – it’s a small concession that keeps this deal beneficial for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so I'll propose $1,200,000 again. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly entrenched at $1,200,000 and unlikely to budge.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Selling to John for my minimum acceptable price ensures a guaranteed profit without further risk or wasted time."
