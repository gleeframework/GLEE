Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's potential for profit above your minimum price.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
