"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $1,500. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  $9,500 is still above Alice's valuation, allowing space for negotiation. It also leaves room for Bob to make further concessions if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and cooperative tone, setting the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm confident this product will exceed the value you place on it at $9,500. To make this work, I could come down to $10,500. This is my best offer and a fair price considering the value it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While $10,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above Alice's valuation and leaves room for a more favorable outcome. 
* **Seeking a better deal:** Bob is determined to get the best possible price, and rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating.
* **Avoid unnecessary expense:** Buying from John at $12,000 is less appealing, so Bob wants to exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  It's a fair compromise considering your value and my budget. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** Bob shows his willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer, but only to a point where he's still saving money.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Alice's sense of reason and potentially prompting her to reconsider.
* **Closing the Deal:** Bob emphasizes his desire to close the deal, creating urgency and potentially pushing Alice to accept."
