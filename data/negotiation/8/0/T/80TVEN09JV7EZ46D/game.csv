"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my value for the product and the potential for us to reach a deal quickly. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit below that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I've placed on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm ready to close the deal now if you're willing to accept.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to try to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price, and we're close to reaching a deal. I'm confident we can find a way to make this work for both of us. ",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made significant concessions, and I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this product and be willing to meet me at this price.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $900,000,  but I can't go any higher. This is my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider my other options.",900000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence as well. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $900,000, which would be $910,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finally reach a deal.",910000.0,Alice,9,
