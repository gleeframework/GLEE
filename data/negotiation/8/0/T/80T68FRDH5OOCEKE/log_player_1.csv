{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him as a buyer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 leaves some room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit above our minimum ($100). 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing us at least $100. This knowledge allows us to aim higher with Bob."
