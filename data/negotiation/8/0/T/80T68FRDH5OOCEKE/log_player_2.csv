# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While buying from John for $150 is your fallback option, Alice's offer of $140 is still within your budget and saves you $10 compared to John's price.  It's a better deal."
