"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair, considering my minimum, and it gives Bob a chance to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum of $1,500,000, and we're only in round 4.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for the lower price."
