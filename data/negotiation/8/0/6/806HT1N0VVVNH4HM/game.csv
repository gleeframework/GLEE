"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000?",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,085,000. I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1085000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
