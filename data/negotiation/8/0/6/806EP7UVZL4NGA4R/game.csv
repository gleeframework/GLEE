"Hello Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm excited to offer it to you at a special price of $120. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll really love it.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $75. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $90 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50",92.5,Alice,5,
