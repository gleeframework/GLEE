{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob at $120. This is a reasonable starting point:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives him room to negotiate down.
* **It's below my minimum:** This gives me some leeway to negotiate up if necessary. 

If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer again, or walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give up on making a profit.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could we possibly agree on $95 for the product? It would be greatly appreciated. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to go lower than $150. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
