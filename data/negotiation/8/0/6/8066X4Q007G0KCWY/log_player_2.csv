{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously.  $10,000 is a substantial drop from her initial offer, but still within my budget. This will gauge her willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push her closer to my desired price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but still value getting a good deal. It's a compromise between my initial offer and her last offer, and could potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to my desired price and represents a good deal. There's a chance she could go lower, but the risk of further negotiation could lead to her rejecting my offer or me missing out on a good deal altogether. At this price, it's likely a better deal than buying from John."
