"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's still very attractive. I understand its value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant discount for you, and it allows me to secure a fair deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
