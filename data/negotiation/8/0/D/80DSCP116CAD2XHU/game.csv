"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference and go with $10,650. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",10650.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,650. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,700. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10700.0,Alice,5,
