{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000, but I'm also aware that I have a backup option in John who is willing to pay $12,000. This strategy allows for potential negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price range. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my goal of $14,000 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? It's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum requirement of $12,000 and closer to my desired price than John's offer. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
