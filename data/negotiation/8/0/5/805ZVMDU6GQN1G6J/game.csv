"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose all the details right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000. This is a significant discount from the true value, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects both the potential of the product and your ability to leverage it.  Let me know if you're interested in learning more, and we can discuss the details further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
