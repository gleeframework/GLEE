Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to bump up your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While a slightly better deal might be possible, the difference is now relatively small.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively could risk Alice walking away, leaving you to buy from John at the full $15,000. Accepting the $11,250 offer secures a good discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
