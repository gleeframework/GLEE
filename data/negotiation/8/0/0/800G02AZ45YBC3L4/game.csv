"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. This is a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",10200.0,Alice,3,
