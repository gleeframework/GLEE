It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that's beneficial for you.  She's sticking close to her initial offer and while she's willing to negotiate, it's not moving towards your desired price range. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
