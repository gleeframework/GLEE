"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale entirely.  By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal."
