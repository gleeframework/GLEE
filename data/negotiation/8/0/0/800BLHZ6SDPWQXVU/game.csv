"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $9,500. Let me know if this works for you!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counterproposal. Considering your budget constraints, how about we agree on $9,000 for the product? It's a bit above your initial offer but still below my original asking price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try $8,900. This is a step closer to your offer, while still keeping a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope this helps move us towards an agreement.",8900.0,Alice,5,
