Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it allows for some negotiation space while still being significantly higher than my minimum price of $120. It also demonstrates that I am serious about selling the product but am open to finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product to me.  I believe $140 is a fair compromise and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer of $135 is close enough to my desired price and significantly higher than John's offer. It's a good compromise that allows me to earn a reasonable profit."
