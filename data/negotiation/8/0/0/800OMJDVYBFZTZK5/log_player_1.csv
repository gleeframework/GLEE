Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to potentially negotiate down, getting us closer to our minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This initial offer is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. 
* Carefully consider Bob's counter-offers. Don't be afraid to walk away if he's not willing to meet a price close to your minimum.  You have a strong alternative with John."
