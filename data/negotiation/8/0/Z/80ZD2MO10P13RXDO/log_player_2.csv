"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, he can potentially get a better price.  He has room to negotiate since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him and only $800,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This price is a good compromise and allows him to save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
