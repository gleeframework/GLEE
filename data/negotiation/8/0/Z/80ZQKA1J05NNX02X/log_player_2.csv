"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation, as the product is worth $12,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $13,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $14,000.**  This is still better than John's price of $15,000.
* **Bob is looking to save money.** While he wanted to get it for $13,000, Alice won't budge.  Accepting the offer is the best option to save money and secure the product."
