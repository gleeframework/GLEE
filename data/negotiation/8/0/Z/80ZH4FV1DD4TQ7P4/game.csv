"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer. While I believe $950,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  I think this represents a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to consider a price of $980,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $940,000?",940000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to consider a price of $990,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't go as high as $990,000.  Would you consider $960,000?  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within a reasonable budget.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I've already made a significant concession with my previous offer of $990,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",980000.0,Alice,9,
