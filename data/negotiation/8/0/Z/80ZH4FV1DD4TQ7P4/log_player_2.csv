Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I've already made a significant concession with my previous offer of $990,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
