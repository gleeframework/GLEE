Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than your minimum value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher price. It also shows Bob that you're serious about selling but not desperate to sell at the lowest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still far below the product's worth to him. There's more room to negotiate, and a counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still holding out for a price closer to your ideal value. It shows Bob that you are serious about selling, but also that you are confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a higher price, especially considering the product is worth a lot more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still keeping your price above Bob's last offer. It shows Bob that you're willing to come down a bit but still value the product.  The risk is that Bob could reject again and you might end up selling to John for less, but this is a calculated risk to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still below your desired price. At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high. Bob might keep lowering his offer, and you could end up selling to John for a much lower price. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees you at least your minimum value. It's time to cut your losses and move on."
