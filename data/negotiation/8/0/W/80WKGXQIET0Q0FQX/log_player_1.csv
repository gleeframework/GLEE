Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1150000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,050,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1050000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1025000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close enough to my minimum and a good compromise. It's worth it to secure the deal and avoid the risk of him walking away completely or having to sell to John for a lower price."
