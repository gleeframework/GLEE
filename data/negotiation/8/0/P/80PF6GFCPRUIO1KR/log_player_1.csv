"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I know it's more than the product is worth to him, but I'm hoping he'll see value in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175, which is still a bit above my minimum, but it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate and that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough one. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm running out of time and rounds. Accepting Bob's offer for $140 is better than selling to John for $150, as it nets me a slightly higher profit and keeps the negotiation alive."
