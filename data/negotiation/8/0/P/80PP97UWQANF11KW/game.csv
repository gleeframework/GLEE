"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. However, I'm aiming to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
