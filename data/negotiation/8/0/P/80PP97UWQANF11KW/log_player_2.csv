"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $12,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. I can try to get the price down further by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. However, I'm aiming to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer to $10,500, which is closer to my target price of $9,000. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm getting a good deal at $10,500 and saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. It's not a huge risk to accept this offer."
