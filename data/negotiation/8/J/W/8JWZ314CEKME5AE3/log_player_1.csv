Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be of great value."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values it at $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  While Alice could start higher, an overly aggressive price might discourage Bob from engaging in negotiation altogether. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale to Bob."
