``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, it's still within your budget and there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to your ideal price, you can still potentially get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down a bit further before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $9,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,250. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to sell it to you at this price 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  At $9,250, you're still getting a good deal, saving $2,750 compared to buying from John.  It's not worth risking the deal to try and get a slightly lower price, especially since you don't know how many more rounds Alice will be willing to negotiate."
