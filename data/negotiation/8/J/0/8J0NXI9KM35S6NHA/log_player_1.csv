Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll receive."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets significantly more than John's offer.
* **Confident Approach:** The message frames the offer as valuable and exclusive, increasing its perceived worth to Bob. 

**Why not higher?**  While Bob values the product at $1,500,000, an offer too close to that might:

* **Scare him off:**  It might seem like there's no room for negotiation.
* **Appear greedy:** Potentially souring the deal."
