Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 offer sits comfortably above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while remaining attractive compared to your alternative buyer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially prevents drawn-out negotiations. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This assumes Bob isn't a fierce negotiator. If you anticipate back-and-forth, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship Building:**  The tone remains polite and professional, aiming for a win-win even if Bob declines."
