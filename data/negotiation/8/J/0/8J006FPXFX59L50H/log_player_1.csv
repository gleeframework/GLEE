{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,200,000 without losing him to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves a potential profit of $150,000 for you while still giving Bob a significant incentive to buy. This price point acknowledges the product's high value to both parties.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk missing out."
