Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from my ideal price. It's worth another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $10,000."

I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it.

Alice is holding firm, and while $13,000 isn't a terrible price, I know I have the option to buy from John for $10,000. It's time to cut my losses with Alice and take the guaranteed savings."
