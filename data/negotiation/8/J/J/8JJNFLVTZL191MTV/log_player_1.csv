Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a lower price than you'd expect, and I'll still be able to make a significant profit. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  $1,400,000 is a significant profit for me, yet still a good deal for Bob compared to his valuation.
* **Safeguard against Loss:**  I'm confident John will buy for $1,500,000, so I have a strong fallback position. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This price allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
