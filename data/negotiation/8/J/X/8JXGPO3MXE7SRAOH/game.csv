"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. My asking price is $12,500. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss.",12500.0,Alice,1,
