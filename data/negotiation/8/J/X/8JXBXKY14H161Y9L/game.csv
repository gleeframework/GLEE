"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to you, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  This would give you a significant profit and allows me to acquire the product at a price that works for my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
