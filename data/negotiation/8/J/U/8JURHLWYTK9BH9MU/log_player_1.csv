Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you.  Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Highlighting Value, Not Just Price:** The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" to justify the high price, rather than solely focusing on the numerical value. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act, potentially pushing him towards a decision.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob's thoughts, indicating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:**  Alice has a strong fallback option with John. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can afford to negotiate down slightly, but she shouldn't go below $1,200,000 as John guarantees that amount."
