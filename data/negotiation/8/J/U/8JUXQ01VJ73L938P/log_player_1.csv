Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 for you, and I'm confident it can bring significant value to your business. My starting price is $1,200,000, which is a fair reflection of its worth.  Let's discuss further and find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe $1,200,000 is a bit high for this product. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still firm on the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  This is a fair price and I'm hopeful we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for a higher offer. I'll try to negotiate a price closer to my ideal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $975,000 doesn't fully reflect the value this product will bring to your company. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer still represents a great deal for both of us, and allows you to secure a valuable asset.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I'm getting close to my minimum price, and with only 4 rounds left, I risk losing out on a sale altogether if I reject this offer."
