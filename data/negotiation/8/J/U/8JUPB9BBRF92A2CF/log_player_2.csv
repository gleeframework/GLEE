It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to you, there's room to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to the middle ground.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, and we can adjust from there."

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still higher than I'd like. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility but staying within my desired range. This counteroffer might be more appealing to Alice while still allowing me to save a significant amount of money."

Alice has come down to $800,000, which is within a reasonable range.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's getting close to my desired range and is significantly cheaper than buying from John.  I'll accept this offer to secure the product."
