**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for the lowest price possible. While Alice's offer is better than the $1,000,000 she values the product at, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $800,000 is the best option for Bob."
