"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I explicitly state that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us, indicating flexibility. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle immediately. I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore potentially better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $800,000 is slightly below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still represents a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000, which is a compromise, but still above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's value and how it's a good deal for Bob even at the counteroffer price. 
* **Show Flexibility:** I express willingness to bridge the gap, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging further discussion.

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground while maintaining a slight advantage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $825,000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Considering that I have already rejected his previous offer and he seems firm on this price, it is likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly higher price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
