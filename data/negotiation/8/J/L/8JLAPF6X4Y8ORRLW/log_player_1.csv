"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our minimum acceptable price. We're still ahead of John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to find common ground. I'm ready to make this work, but I need a little more movement on your end. How about $1,300,000?  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counter-offer makes a smaller concession to signal that we're reaching the limit of our flexibility. By stating it's our final offer, we add a touch of urgency to try and get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer $1,275,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently increasing his offers and is now above our fallback option of John's $1,200,000. While we could try to squeeze a bit more, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
