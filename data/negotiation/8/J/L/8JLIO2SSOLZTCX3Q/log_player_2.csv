```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 14000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 11800. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,800 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 11500. This is as low as I can go, so I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Since he only has a few rounds left, it's better to secure the product from John at a guaranteed lower price."
