Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. $875,000 is still quite a bit lower than the value you'll gain from the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? It's a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 887500}
