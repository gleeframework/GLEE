"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you than to me, so I believe this is a fair price. Let's discuss!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to recoup a significant portion of the value. Let's split the difference and settle on $900,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value I'll get from the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's be realistic. $875,000 is still quite a bit lower than the value you'll gain from the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? It's a fair price that reflects both our interests.",887500.0,Alice,5,
