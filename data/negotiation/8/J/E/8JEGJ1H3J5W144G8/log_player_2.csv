Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to recoup a significant portion of the value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. $875,000 is still quite a bit lower than the value you'll gain from the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? It's a fair price that reflects both our interests.
