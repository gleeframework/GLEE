Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $800,000 to reflect what I believe it's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I respect your position, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth pushing for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this.  I'm willing to accept $875,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We've reached a point where pushing further might discourage Bob. Offering a price slightly above the midpoint between his last offer and our previous ask shows flexibility and a desire to close the deal. Stating it's our final offer adds a sense of urgency."
