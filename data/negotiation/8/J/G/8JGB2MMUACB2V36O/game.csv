"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still leaves some room for negotiation but also reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your needs. I believe this is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is closer to my expectations, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This offer acknowledges your budget constraints and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's close this deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. $1100000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is a substantial increase from my last offer. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make this deal work. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1000000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
