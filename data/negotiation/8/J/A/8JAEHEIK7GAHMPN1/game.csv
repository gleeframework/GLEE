"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a substantial offer, the product's unique value justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand you're making a serious investment, and to show I'm flexible, I'm willing to agree to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the value of the product.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,500,000 is closer, I'm still looking to stay under $1,400,000.  I'm willing to go to $1,450,000 as a final offer.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
