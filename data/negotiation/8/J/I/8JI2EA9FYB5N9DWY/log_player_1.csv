Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Offering a slightly lower price to Bob upfront provides the advantage of a faster, more certain sale compared to waiting for John's guaranteed $10,000."
