"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $130 instead of $150 provides space for a back and forth to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  While selling to John for $150 is an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm acknowledging Bob's interest and desire for a good deal. This helps to maintain a friendly and collaborative tone.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  While $115 is closer to my desired price, it still allows for potential adjustments if Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While $110 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Small Gap:** The gap between our offers is now smaller, suggesting that we are getting closer to a deal. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round and see if he's willing to budge further. 
* **Remaining Options:** Selling to John is always an option, but I'm still hoping to close a deal with Bob for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  $110 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?  That way we both get a good deal, and I can get this product into your hands."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $110. This demonstrates a genuine willingness to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us in reaching a deal. This emphasizes the positive aspects of closing the sale and encourages Bob to see the value in accepting my offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While this offer is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, I'm still holding on to some leverage by not fully accepting his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:**  While $108 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I still feel there's room for negotiation, especially since we're already in the 6th round.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and can potentially push for a slightly higher price in the next round.
* **Potential for Agreement:** We are getting closer with each round, so there's a good chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $150, I want to see if I can squeeze out a slightly higher price from Bob, who seems genuinely interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $108 just doesn't quite cut it for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm offering a price halfway between my last offer of $112.50 and Bob's offer of $108. This shows a continued willingness to find common ground. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the compromise. This appeals to Bob's sense of reason and helps to make the offer more appealing.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is starting to build. This counteroffer could be a good opportunity to close the deal.
* **Potential for Agreement:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is only $2 away from his last offer.  There's a good chance he might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing. 
* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my desired minimum. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Even if I can negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob in the next round, there's no guarantee he will accept. 

It's better to take the sure thing and sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
