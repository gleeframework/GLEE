Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer sets a price that is higher than your minimum desired value of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. If he rejects, you still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you don't lose out on your minimum profit."
