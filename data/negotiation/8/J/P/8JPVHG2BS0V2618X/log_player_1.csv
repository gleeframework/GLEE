"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. I believe that Bob will likely counteroffer, giving us a chance to negotiate.  However, I'm keeping John's offer in mind, and I'm willing to accept a price no lower than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I would prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with nothing.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $8,000 than to risk losing both Bob and John."
