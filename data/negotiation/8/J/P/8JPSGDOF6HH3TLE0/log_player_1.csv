Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible while still making the sale to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, potentially increasing your profit slightly.
* **Avoid a Lowball:**  Starting too low (e.g., $100) could insult Bob or make him think the product is worth less than it is. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the sale to Bob, avoiding the need to sell to John at your minimum price."
