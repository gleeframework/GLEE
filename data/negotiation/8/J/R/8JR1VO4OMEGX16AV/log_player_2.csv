Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.
