"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is closer, but I can't quite make that work yet. Could you do $900,000?  That would be fantastic.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is your limit right now.  However, I'm still not quite there.  To make this deal work for me, I need to be at $925,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the fact that I've already come down from my original asking price.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
