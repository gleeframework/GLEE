"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$850,000 is a good starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.**  You want to see if you can get a better deal. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you plenty of time to explore options and potentially secure a lower price.
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's the most expensive.**  You'll only choose this if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A $100,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is significant. It shows you're serious about getting a good price, but it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer still leaves room for Alice to make a counter-counteroffer.  This allows for a back-and-forth that could ultimately lead to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Avoiding John for Now:** You're still aiming to save as much money as possible, and buying from John right now would be significantly more expensive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your counteroffer:** $820,000 is closer to your $750,000 offer than her initial $850,000. This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **There's still room for improvement:**  You believe you can still get a lower price, especially considering you have more rounds left.
* **John is still the last resort:** You want to exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to the higher price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Alice's latest offer ($820,000) and your previous offer ($750,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Testing the Waters:** It's a small increment that allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to concede further. If she accepts, you've successfully gotten a better price. If she rejects, you'll know to go slightly higher in the next round.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** It keeps the negotiation moving towards your target price without making the offer so low that it's likely to be rejected outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still not meeting your target:** $810,000 is closer to your ideal price, but it's still too high. You're determined to get a better deal.
* **You have more rounds to negotiate:**  Five rounds remain, giving you the opportunity to continue negotiating.
* **John is still the backup:**  You're not desperate enough to jump to John's price just yet. You'll try to get Alice closer to your goal first."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This offer is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  
* **Testing the Waters:** It's a way to gauge how close Alice is to accepting your desired price. If she accepts, you've successfully negotiated a good deal. If she rejects, you'll know to increase your offer again in the next round.
* **Remaining Patient:** You're still in a good position, with several rounds left to negotiate and John's offer as a safety net. You're not rushing into a deal just yet."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $805,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're almost there:** Alice is coming closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for improvement.  
* **More rounds to play:**  We have 3 rounds left, which means we have more time to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price.
* **John is a backup, not a priority:** It's still too early to buy from John. We're determined to get a better deal with Alice, if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 795000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This offer is a slight increase from your previous counteroffer, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest proposal. It shows you're serious about closing the deal while still pushing for a favorable price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** We're nearing the end of negotiations, so a slight increase in the offer is acceptable to demonstrate a willingness to compromise. However, it's still within the range you're comfortable with.
* **Anticipating Alice's Response:** If Alice rejects this offer, you'll need to carefully consider your options.  You may have to accept her next offer, or you could risk buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** This is the penultimate round.  There's only one more chance to negotiate with Alice before you're forced to buy from John.
* **Alice is close to your target:** $800,000 is only $5,000 away from your previous offer, and much closer to your initial goal.
* **The risk of John is real:**  If you reject this offer, you'll likely have to buy from John, which would be much more expensive. It's a calculated risk to accept Alice's offer, but it's the best choice to maximize your savings."
