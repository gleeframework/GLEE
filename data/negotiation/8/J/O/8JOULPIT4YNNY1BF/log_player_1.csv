"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my floor price, and I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my own budget.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my floor price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I'm keeping my options open to sell to John if we can't reach a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's close the deal this round."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob has reached my floor price of $1,000,000. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
