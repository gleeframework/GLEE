"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your own budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my own budget.  Let's work towards a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's close the deal this round.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
