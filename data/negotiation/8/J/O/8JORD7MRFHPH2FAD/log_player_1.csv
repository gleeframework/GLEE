Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it could be a great investment for you.  This price represents a significant saving for you, considering its worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $950,000. This is a good compromise:
    * It's higher than Bob's value of $800,000, allowing me to earn more than from John.
    * It's lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000, so I'm still making a profit. 
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the potential value for Bob and framing the price as a good deal.  I'm also leaving the door open for further negotiation.

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Maximizes profit:** I'm likely to earn more from Bob than from John.
* **Minimizes risk:** If Bob rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer.
* **Sets a positive tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
