"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal as the product is worth at least $12,000 to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. She claims it's worth $12,000 to you, but you know your maximum is $12,000, and you always want to pay less if possible.
* She's also using a pressure tactic by mentioning another buyer at $8,000 (which is suspiciously close to her own valuation). This is likely a bluff to make you act quickly.
* By rejecting her offer, you can gauge her response and see if she's willing to come down closer to her own valuation. You can then decide whether to negotiate further or go with John."
