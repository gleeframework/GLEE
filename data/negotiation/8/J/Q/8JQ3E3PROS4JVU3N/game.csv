"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to make this deal work.  This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a fair outcome. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $940,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a significant compromise on my end.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go down to $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $920,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $930,000? It's a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal alive. Let's close this deal now.",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $920,000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $915,000, and that's as low as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",915000.0,Bob,8,
