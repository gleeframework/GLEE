"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need $14,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting too close to my maximum budget, and there's no guarantee Alice will go down enough. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees the best price."
