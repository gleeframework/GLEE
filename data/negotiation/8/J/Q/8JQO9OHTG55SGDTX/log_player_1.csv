"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd be interested. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation with a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I have 8 rounds left and can likely get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $95 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 6 rounds left and can potentially get a better offer.  I'm not in a rush to sell, so I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $100 is closer, but I need to get at least $105 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my price of $105. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price.  It also leaves room for potential compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $102 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $102 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 4 rounds left and can potentially get a better offer. I'm confident I can close the deal at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $103. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 103}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my price of $105, but I'm coming down slightly to $103.  This shows Bob that I'm flexible, but also that I still expect a fair price. It also leaves room for potential compromise in the next round.  With only 3 rounds left, it's important to start closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $102.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers. While $102.5 is still below my ideal price, it's a decent offer and I'm confident that I can't get a much higher price in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure a deal now than risk getting nothing."
