"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. ",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am unable to agree to $1,080,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,060,000. This feels closer to a fair compromise given our respective positions.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
