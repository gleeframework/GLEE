"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  I'm proposing $1,600,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
