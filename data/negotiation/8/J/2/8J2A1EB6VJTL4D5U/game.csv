"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any flexibility on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that $9000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
