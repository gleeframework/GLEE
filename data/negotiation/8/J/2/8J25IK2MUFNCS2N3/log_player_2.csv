"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value.  You can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice.  There's no need to rush into a deal, especially since John is offering a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum value. You can still potentially negotiate a better price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum value of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price that is more favorable to you.  You'll save $125,000 by buying from John."
