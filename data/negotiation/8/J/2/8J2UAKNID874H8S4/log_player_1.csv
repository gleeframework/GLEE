Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer. Accepting $1,225,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and a better outcome than potentially ending up with John's offer at the end of the rounds."
