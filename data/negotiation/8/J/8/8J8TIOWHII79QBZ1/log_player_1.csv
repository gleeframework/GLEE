{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob ($850,000 vs. $800,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. 
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is polite and emphasizes the value of the product to build rapport with Bob.
* **Negotiation Option:**  I'm open to Bob's counteroffer, leaving the door open for a successful deal. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $800,000, so I have a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we consider $790,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $790,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  Even though John is willing to pay $800,000, there's still room to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  While I acknowledge your point about finding a more agreeable price, $790,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm making a counter-offer that's closer to his initial price.  I'm also providing a reason for my counter-offer, emphasizing my commitment to a fair deal.
* **Significantly Reduced Price:** I'm making a substantial reduction from my original asking price ($850,000 to $825,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Minimum Threshold:**  My counter-offer remains above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, acknowledging that we still need to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'd like to propose $800,000 as the price for the product. This aligns closely with my budget and the perceived value of the item. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not losing money, and it's a fair deal. 
* **No Need for Further Negotiation:**  There's no need to continue negotiating as I've reached my goal.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could potentially get a higher price, there's always the risk that negotiations will fall apart, and I'll be forced to sell to John for the same price."
