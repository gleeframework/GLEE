"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we consider $790,000 for the product?",790000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  While I acknowledge your point about finding a more agreeable price, $790,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
