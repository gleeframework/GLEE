"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob should attempt to get a lower price before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident that this product offers you significant value beyond the $950,000 mark. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true worth of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to negotiate.  While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, there's still a $175,000 gap between their offers.  By rejecting and making another counteroffer, Bob can continue to try and lower the price."
