,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we both have our limits, Alice.  How about $9,000? That's a significant increase on my end and brings us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer of $9,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to split the difference - $9,125.  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9125.0,Bob,6,
