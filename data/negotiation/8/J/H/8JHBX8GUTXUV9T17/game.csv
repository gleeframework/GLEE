"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $9,000?  That still leaves room for you to make a good profit, and it's closer to what I need.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
