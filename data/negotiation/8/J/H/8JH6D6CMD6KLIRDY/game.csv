"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $115?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $107 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
