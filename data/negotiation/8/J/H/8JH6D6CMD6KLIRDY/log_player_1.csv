{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate.  It also opens the communication by acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price ($120).  I'm not going to accept it, but I'm also not going to give up on the negotiation.  I'll counter-offer and try to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $115?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $107 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my goal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
