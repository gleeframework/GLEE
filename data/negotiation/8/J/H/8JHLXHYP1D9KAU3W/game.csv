"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still outside my range. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $9500? This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still holding firm on your price, but $11000 is simply out of my range. I'm prepared to walk away unless we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $10500, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $12000, which would be $11250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11250.0,Alice,7,
