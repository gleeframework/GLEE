"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still well below what the product is worth to you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  While $9,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
