Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable offer:** $150 is a significant markup from my minimum, but it's not outrageous. It might entice Bob to accept, or at least start a negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to negotiating. This encourages Bob to counter-offer, allowing us to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $120 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **No reason to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee I can get more from Bob.  
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation takes time, and I could lose the opportunity to sell to another buyer. 
* **John's offer is the same:** John is also willing to pay $120, so I'm not losing out by accepting Bob's offer."
