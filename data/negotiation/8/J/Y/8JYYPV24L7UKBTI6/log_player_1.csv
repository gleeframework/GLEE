{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth $12,000 to you, but I'm hoping you'll find this price fair. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a decent discount while still leaving me a profit above my minimum of $15,000.  This is a starting point, and I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still not ideal. I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still offering you a great deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, his final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's better to sell to John for $15,000, which is more than my minimum, and guarantees a successful sale."
