,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, and understand your position. However,  $1,250,000 is below my bottom line. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's true value.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,325,000 is closer, but it's still slightly out of my range.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,300,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
