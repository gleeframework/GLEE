"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties to collaborate. We're extending an exclusive offer to you for $950,000. This price reflects the value we place on your business and the potential synergy between our companies. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the sentiment, I believe a price of $800,000 would be more reflective of the market value. I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a reasonable negotiating range. It gives you room to move upwards while aiming for a price well below your $1,000,000 limit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly imply you've researched comparable products, putting some pressure on Alice.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains polite and emphasizes mutual benefit, encouraging continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We appreciate your feedback and understanding of market values. In light of your proposal, we would like to extend a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. This price aims to bridge the gap between our initial offer and your counterproposal, while still reflecting the value we place on this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we still have room to negotiate.  Her counteroffer of $850,000 is closer to our target, but we should try to push for a better deal before considering John's offer or accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm encouraged that we're getting closer on price. To be frank, my budget allows for $825,000. If we can agree on that, I'm prepared to finalize the deal today."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($850,000) and your previous one ($800,000). It shows willingness to compromise but maintains a firm stance.
* **Budget Emphasis:** By mentioning your budget explicitly, you add a sense of urgency and limitation, potentially motivating Alice to concede.
* **Closing Statement:**  Phrases like ""finalize the deal today"" signal that you're serious and ready to move forward if Alice accepts the offer."
