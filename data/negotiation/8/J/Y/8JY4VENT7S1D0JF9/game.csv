"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle of our last offers at $7625? It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",7625.0,Bob,4,

"I like that you're thinking creatively, Bob! Meeting in the middle of our last offers is a great idea. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we try $7950? It's a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",7950.0,Alice,5,
