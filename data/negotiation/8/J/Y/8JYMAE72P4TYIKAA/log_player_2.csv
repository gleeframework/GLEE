"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is a good price, you have a goal of saving as much as possible.  Since this is the first round, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $125 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge. My goal is to get the price as close to my $100 valuation as possible, but I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $105 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my original offer. I'm willing to come down to $115. This still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, and $115 is a good price.  I'm happy to accept this offer and save $10 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise that allows both of us to be satisfied."
