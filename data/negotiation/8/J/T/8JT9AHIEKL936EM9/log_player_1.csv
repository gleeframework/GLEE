Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $100. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer, while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer. I'm highlighting the value of the product to emphasize its worthiness of the price. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  While $100 is less than my ideal selling price, it's still a profitable transaction.
* **Start a negotiation:** By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm inviting Bob to negotiate and potentially come closer to my desired price. 
* **Secure a sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can consider his counteroffer or move on to John, who is guaranteed to buy the product for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiations.** I believe I can potentially get a better price by countering Bob's offer and exploring his willingness to pay more.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  However, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob in hopes of achieving a higher selling price than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's meet halfway and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $95. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price and highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Strategy:** By taking a more moderate position, I'm hoping to create an environment where Bob feels more inclined to come up on his offer. This increases my chances of getting a higher price without completely shutting down negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $90. I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is now $90.** This is closer to my desired price and higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Accepting his offer is the best option.** It allows me to secure a sale for a price that is within my acceptable range, and potentially avoids further rounds of negotiation which could lead to a stalemate.
* **Selling to John is still an option,** but this offer from Bob is already profitable, and I don't want to risk losing a sale by being too hesitant."
