Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows you to potentially earn a little extra.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,999 is just below your guaranteed price, making it more tempting for Bob while still netting you a significant profit.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly better deal. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
