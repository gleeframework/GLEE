Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  To start, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm holding out for a better deal. I have 10 rounds, and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. It's worth seeing if I can push Bob closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident its value to you is similar.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price given the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, but I believe I can push him a little further. I'm confident I can get a price closer to $1,000,000 by continuing the negotiations.  Plus, I always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. The product has a significant value, and I'm confident you recognize that.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is fair to both of us, reflecting the product's worth and allowing for a successful deal.  Let's work together to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
