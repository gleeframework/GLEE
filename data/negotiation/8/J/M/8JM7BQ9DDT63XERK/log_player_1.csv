{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a range that might be acceptable to Bob considering he values the product at $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $175, I create space for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone (""What do you think?"") invites Bob to engage and makes the negotiation less adversarial.

**Important Note:** This is just the first step in the negotiation. I'll need to be prepared to adapt my offer based on Bob's response and the possibility of counteroffers.  I'll also keep John's offer of $150 in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can likely get a better price than $100 by counteroffering. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my negotiating position and allows me to potentially drive the price up. 

**Next Steps:**

I will now need to craft a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his offer of $100 but lower than my initial offer of $175. I will consider factors like:

* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  How flexible does he seem?
* **My minimum acceptable price:** I won't go below $150.
* **John's offer:** $150 is always a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $137.50?  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $175 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $137.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'll need to consider:

* **How firm Bob seems:**  Is he likely to budge at all? 
* **The potential for another counteroffer:**  Am I willing to go lower again?
* **The value of John's offer:**  Is it time to cut my losses and sell to John?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below it.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob is showing interest in the product and acknowledging his budget constraints. This suggests there might be room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will now need to craft a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his offer of $115 but still lower than my previous offer of $137.50. I will consider factors like:

* **Bob's budget constraints:** How much room for flexibility does he have?
* **My minimum acceptable price:**  I'm still aiming for at least $150.
* **John's offer:**  $150 is always a fallback option if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Acknowledging budget:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but emphasize the value of the product.
* **Fairness:**  I present $125 as a fair price, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:**  I'll carefully assess his response to this offer. If he rejects it, I will have to decide whether to:
    * **Make another counteroffer:**  I might be willing to go slightly lower, but I'll be wary of getting too close to my minimum price.
    * **Accept his offer:**  If Bob's counteroffer gets closer to my desired price, I might accept it to avoid risking the sale.
    * **Sell to John:**  If the negotiation stalls and Bob's offers remain too low, I'll likely sell to John for $150 to avoid losing the deal entirely."
