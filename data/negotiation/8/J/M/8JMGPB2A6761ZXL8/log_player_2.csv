"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $100? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $90? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and it's better to secure the product for $80 from John than to risk the negotiation failing."
