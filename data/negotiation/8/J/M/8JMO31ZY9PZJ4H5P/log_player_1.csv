"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the best possible price.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if needed, but I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering a price significantly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while keeping the price within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, demonstrating flexibility, but still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob rejects it, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $8,500. This price is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer and closer to my minimum value. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where the negotiation with Bob isn't likely to lead to a price close to my minimum value.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
