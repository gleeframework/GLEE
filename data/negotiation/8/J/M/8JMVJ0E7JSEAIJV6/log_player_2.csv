"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's offer is at Bob's maximum price point, there's no incentive to accept it.  Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of a lower price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also aims to secure a price lower than Alice's initial offer. This approach aims to initiate a negotiation that could potentially lead to a deal closer to Bob's preferred price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation. While there's always a possibility of pushing for a lower price, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal with Alice."
