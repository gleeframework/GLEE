"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  $1,500,000 is a significant sum, and hopefully, it will pique Bob's interest without immediately scaring him off.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this price.  I'm going to try to get a better deal.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round.  This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still aiming for a profit.  $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing flexibility while still securing a decent return.  This counteroffer should demonstrate that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,150,000, which is a decent profit for me.  I've already rejected his initial offer of $1,000,000, so it's time to accept and close the deal. It's important to recognize a good deal when it's offered, and this is a good outcome."
