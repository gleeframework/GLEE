Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it above that price makes sense.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. 

This strategy aims to secure a higher profit from Bob while still having a safety net with John's offer."
