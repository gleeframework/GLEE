"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This would still be a good profit for you, and a significant saving for me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1050000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This is a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1125000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1087500? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and hopefully, we can close this deal.",1087500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm still aiming for a bit higher, but I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle.  Let's try $1106250. This is a small compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1106250.0,Alice,5,
