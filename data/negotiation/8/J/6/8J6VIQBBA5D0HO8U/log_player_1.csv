Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you've been interested in its potential. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding our minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing our profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other buyers creates urgency and might make Bob more likely to accept the offer quickly.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  We know we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, so there's limited risk in offering a slightly lower price to Bob."
