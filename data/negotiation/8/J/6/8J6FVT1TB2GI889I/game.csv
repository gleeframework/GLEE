"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $130 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product.  Let's close the gap - $115 and it's yours.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $115 is still beyond my budget.  I'm offering $105, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",105.0,Bob,6,
