"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
