"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly below Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Not Insulting:** While low, the $800,000 offer is still a significant amount and doesn't completely dismiss Alice's valuation.
* **Gauging Alice:**  This first counteroffer will help me understand Alice's flexibility and how serious she is about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but $800,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I want to stay engaged and keep the conversation going.
* **Compromise:**  Meeting in the middle shows a willingness to be reasonable and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Still Aiming Lower:** My goal is still to secure the best possible price, which is why I'm not immediately accepting Alice's counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to move much lower. 
* **Minimal Savings:** Even if I could negotiate Alice down a bit further, the potential savings are minimal compared to John's price.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could drag on, and there's no guarantee of getting a significantly better deal.  John offers a sure thing at a good price. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at the known price of $1,000,000."
