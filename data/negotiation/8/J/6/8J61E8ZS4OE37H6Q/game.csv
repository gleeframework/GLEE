"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but $800,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
