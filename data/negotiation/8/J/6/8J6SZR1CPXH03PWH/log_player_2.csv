# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be getting it for a significant discount. If you're interested, let me know. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
