"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower.  How about $850,000?  This still leaves you a good profit, and it's a great deal for me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
