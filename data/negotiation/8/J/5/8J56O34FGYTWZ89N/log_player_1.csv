Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in a dialogue, making it clear you're open to discussing the price.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a professional and respectful tone."
