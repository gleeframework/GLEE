"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down while still making a profit. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $16,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $16,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $18,000. We have 8 rounds left, which gives us enough time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $16,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $17,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 17000}
