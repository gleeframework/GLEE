"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $17,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm still interested in your product. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
