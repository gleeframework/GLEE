"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $1,100,000 is close to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, making it likely to be considered seriously. 
* **Above My Minimum:** This offer ensures a significant profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.
* **Open Communication:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering the potential of this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while also giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  His counteroffer suggests he's very interested in the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a few more rounds to see if I can secure a deal closer to $1 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your perspective on the product's value. While $950,000 is certainly a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is reflected closer to the $1 million mark.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($950,000) and my previous asking price ($1,100,000). This is often a good negotiation tactic, as it suggests a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Strong But Fair:** $1,025,000 is a strong offer that provides a significant profit margin.  It also acknowledges Bob's counteroffer while still striving for a higher price. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. While I recognize its potential, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price considering my assessment of the product and leaves room for both of us to gain.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing he's motivated. We are getting closer to my ideal price range. I believe I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two before considering accepting his offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with and I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this final offer to avoid wasting each other's time.  If you can meet me at $1,000,000, we have a deal. This ensures a fair outcome for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Five rounds is a reasonable amount of back-and-forth.  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and signal that I'm firm on this price.
* **Strong Position:** $1,000,000 is a strong and fair price that meets my goals. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is respectful and acknowledges Bob's efforts in the negotiation, but it also clearly communicates my bottom line. 
* **Time Factor:** By setting a deadline, I introduce a time constraint that may encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. This also protects me from getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation."
