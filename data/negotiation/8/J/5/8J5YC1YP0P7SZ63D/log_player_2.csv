"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering the potential of this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while also giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your perspective on the product's value. While $950,000 is certainly a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is reflected closer to the $1 million mark.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to his target, he can likely still negotiate a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. While I recognize its potential, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price considering my assessment of the product and leaves room for both of us to gain.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with and I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this final offer to avoid wasting each other's time.  If you can meet me at $1,000,000, we have a deal. This ensures a fair outcome for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is at $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he can get the product for $200,000 less than what John is offering.  

While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice might walk away and he'd have to pay the higher price from John.  Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids potential further negotiation risks."
