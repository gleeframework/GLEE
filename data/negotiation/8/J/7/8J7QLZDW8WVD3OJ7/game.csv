"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. Could you consider something closer to $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere. However, $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I could potentially do $10,000.  That's the absolute highest I can go. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
