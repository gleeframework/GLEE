"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This still leaves me some profit, and it's closer to your offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm not quite there yet. I can come down to $10,250, which is a little closer to your offer. It's still a fair price for the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think $10,250 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,6,
