Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's value, but below your minimum:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving you a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob understands the offer and what's being asked. 

Let's see how Bob responds, then we can adjust our strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000 and even lower than what I believe the product is worth. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a low price.  

**Next steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer. I'll need to find a balance between getting a price closer to my minimum and giving Bob enough incentive to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This still leaves me some profit, and it's closer to your offer."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This offer is the middle ground between our initial price ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $10,500 is above my minimum of $12,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Clear Justification:** The message explains the reasoning behind the price, making it seem more reasonable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $9,750 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer again, attempting to find a price that's both profitable for me and reasonable for Bob.  I'll likely aim for a price between $10,000 and $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm not quite there yet. I can come down to $10,250, which is a little closer to your offer. It's still a fair price for the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  This counteroffer is only a $250 decrease from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but not giving away too much.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and cooperative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a price where Bob sees value and I still get a good deal.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $10,250 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer with his offers, $9,800 is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I've already made several concessions, and it seems we're stuck in a stalemate. 

**Why sell to John:**

John is offering my minimum price, which ensures I get the value I want from the product.  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better result, and I don't want to risk losing John's offer."
