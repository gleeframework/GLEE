"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do this at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my minimum.  How about $1,400,000?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $1,325,000?  That's a fair compromise that keeps us both within our ranges.  Let's finalize this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
