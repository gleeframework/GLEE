"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $13,600? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $13,600 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. It's still within Bob's budget, but Bob wants to see if he can push for a lower price. There are still multiple rounds left in the negotiation, so Bob can continue to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $13,300.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 13300}
