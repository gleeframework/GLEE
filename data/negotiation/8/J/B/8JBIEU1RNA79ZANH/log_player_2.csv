Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $600,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers and leaves room for us both to benefit. Let's find a way to make this work.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting close. To make this work, I'm willing to drop to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows for a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.

At this point, Alice has indicated this is her final offer and it's still above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price."
