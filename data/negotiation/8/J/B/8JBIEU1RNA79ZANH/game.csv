"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $600,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers and leaves room for us both to benefit. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting close. To make this work, I'm willing to drop to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows for a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,5,
