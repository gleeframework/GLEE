Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from owning it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without pushing him to reject the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still securing a substantial profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While aiming high, starting with a price too close to Bob's maximum might make him feel like he's being taken advantage of.  
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position and allows her to be more assertive in her negotiation with Bob."
