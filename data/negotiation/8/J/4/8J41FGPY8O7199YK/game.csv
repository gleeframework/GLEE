"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
