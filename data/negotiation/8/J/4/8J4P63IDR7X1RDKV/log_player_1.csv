Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $130. It's worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to value:** I highlight the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By saying ""I'm willing to make you a good deal"", I signal flexibility and invite Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:** If Bob rejects, I have John as an alternative buyer, ensuring I won't lose out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100), but I believe I can still get more. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $130. 
* **No immediate need for John:** While John is a safety net, I'm not desperate to sell at this point, so I can risk continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $130, but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I frame the price as ""fair for both of us,"" emphasizing mutual benefit and encouraging a quick agreement.
* **Urgency:** By stating ""it keeps the deal moving forward,"" I subtly imply a potential time constraint, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $115, and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $115 is just $5 away from my initial target of $120. 
* **Risk of stalemate:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a longer process, potentially causing me to lose more time and possibly the deal with Bob altogether.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could try for another $5, the potential gain is small compared to the risk of losing the deal with Bob and being forced to sell to John for $100.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer of $115 is the most sensible decision in this scenario. It ensures a quick and profitable sale without significant risk."
