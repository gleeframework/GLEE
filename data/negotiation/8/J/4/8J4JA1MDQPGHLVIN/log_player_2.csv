"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value you've placed on it and still allows me to make a good profit. Let me know your decision! If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
