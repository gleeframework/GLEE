Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to go lower.  She's already rejected $10,000 twice.
* **Time:** We're running out of rounds. Continuing to push for a lower price might backfire, leaving us with no deal and forcing us to buy from John at $15,000.
* **Savings:**  $10,500 is still a significant savings compared to John's price. 

While holding out *might* get us a slightly better deal, it's a risky strategy at this point. Accepting now guarantees a good price and avoids a potential loss."
