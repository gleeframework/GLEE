Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,300,000 offer leaves room for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Highlighting that other buyers are interested creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not revealing your absolute bottom line, mentioning ""value and potential"" provides some justification for the high price.

**Important:**  This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob, but don't go below your minimum acceptable price (which is close to your guaranteed offer from John)."
