"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is truly interested and how high his budget might be.  I'll be ready to negotiate down if needed, but I want to see where he stands first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to make a good profit.  I believe this offer is fair and might be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $13,500, which is a good price and a fair compromise.  It's better than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm accepting this offer."
