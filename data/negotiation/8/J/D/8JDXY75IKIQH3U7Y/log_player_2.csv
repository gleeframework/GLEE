"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can potentially get a better price than $1,100,000 by negotiating. There's still room for Alice to make a profit, and you have a higher ceiling for savings."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to go lower, so rejecting and making another counteroffer could potentially get you a better price, closer to your target of $950,000."
