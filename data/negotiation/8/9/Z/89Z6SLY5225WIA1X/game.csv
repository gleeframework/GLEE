"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, the product's worth to me is significantly higher. I can come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
