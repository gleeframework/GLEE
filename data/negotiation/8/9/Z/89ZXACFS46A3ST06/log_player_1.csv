Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While we know John provides a $1,000,000 safety net, aiming high with Bob is strategically sound. 
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" and ""significant return on investment,"" seeking to justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle above our minimum.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In reality, a more nuanced approach with back-and-forth communication might yield even better results."
