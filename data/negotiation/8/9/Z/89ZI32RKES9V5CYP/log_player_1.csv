{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get at least my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept $11,000, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a price slightly closer to Bob's offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm offering $13,000.  This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I hope this signals my willingness to negotiate, but also shows him that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $12,000.  Jhon is offering a fair price, so I'm going to sell to him."
