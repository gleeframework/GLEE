Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Value:** You value the product at a minimum of $10,000, and you have a guaranteed backup buyer in John for that price. 
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation and still provides a significant profit for you, exceeding your minimum value.

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while giving Bob a good deal that he's likely to accept, preventing you from having to sell to John at the lower price."
