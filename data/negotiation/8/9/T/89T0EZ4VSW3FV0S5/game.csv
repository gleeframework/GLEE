"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to secure this valuable product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on $12,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business, and it's still a good deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
