Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer the product to Bob for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent amount. Since I can sell the product to John for $10,000, I'll consider that option. However, I'll also think about the potential profit I could make if I can get Bob to meet me in the middle.

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob that's higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer.
