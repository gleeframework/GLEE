"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget. We know we can get it cheaper from John, so we should try to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic:

* **Establishes our position:** We show Alice that we're looking for a substantial discount.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  We anticipate Alice will counter, giving us space to meet in the middle. 
* **Keeps John in mind:** Our target is still to buy it at John's price ($10,000) or lower if possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is a great deal, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice came down a bit, her offer is still higher than John's price. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?"",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:** We're suggesting a price directly in between our last offer ($8,000) and her counteroffer ($10,500). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us below our maximum budget and puts pressure on Alice. She needs to decide if the potential profit is worth losing the sale. 
* **Time constraint:** As we progress through the rounds,  we remind ourselves that we have the option to go with John at any time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:** Alice's counteroffer of $10,750 shows she's not willing to go significantly lower than her previous offers. 
* **John's offer is better:** We have a standing offer from John at $10,000, which is a better deal than what Alice is currently offering.
* **Limited time and risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice is risky. We might waste valuable rounds and still not get a price as good as John's. 

It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best available price from John."
