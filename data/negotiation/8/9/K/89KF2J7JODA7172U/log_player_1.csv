"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a good compromise - significantly higher than my minimum but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This opens the negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $15,000, and there's still room for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point,  $9,250 is a good compromise. I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial offer, and it's getting closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's a good deal for both of us and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely."
