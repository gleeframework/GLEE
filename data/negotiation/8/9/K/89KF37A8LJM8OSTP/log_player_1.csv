Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to move a bit from my original offer, how about $1,125,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to move from your initial price, but I still think $1,125,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,062,500. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently trying to meet in the middle, which is a good sign he'll go higher. While $1,062,500 is better than John's offer, we are still early in the negotiation and haven't maximized our potential profit.  We'll push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, however, anything under $1,100,000 is pushing the boundaries of what I can accept. I'm open to meeting you halfway one last time - how does $1,100,000 sound?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're setting a clear boundary at $1,100,000, signaling that we're not willing to go much lower. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""last time"" phrase adds a touch of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to agree.
* **Still Above Reserve:** We're still aiming for a price significantly above our fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is sticking to his pattern of meeting in the middle. It's unlikely he'll move significantly higher than this offer.
* **Time Value:**  We still have several rounds left, but the longer the negotiation goes on, the higher the risk that Bob walks away.  
* **Strong Profit:** $1,075,000 is a healthy profit margin above our $1,000,000 fallback option. It's a good deal worth accepting."
