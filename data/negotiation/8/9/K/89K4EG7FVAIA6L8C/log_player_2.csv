"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price. You can always go with John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit away from your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is only $80,000 more than what John is offering. It's unlikely that you'll be able to negotiate further and get a better price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save time and ensure you get the product."
