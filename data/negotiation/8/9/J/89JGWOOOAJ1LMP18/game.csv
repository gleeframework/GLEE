"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'd like to find a mutually beneficial price. I can do $8,200, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,100?",7100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, so how about $8,000 minus 5% for you, which would be $7,600?",7600.0,Alice,5,
