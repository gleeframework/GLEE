"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, leaving room for negotiation but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  The ""Let's make this happen"" phrase subtly adds a touch of urgency to potentially influence Bob's decision. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy for future rounds. If he rejects, I'll likely lower the price slightly, but not too much, to maintain a good profit margin.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $9,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $10,000. 
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:**  Selling to John for $8,000 at this stage would be settling for less than I could potentially get from Bob. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I can counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility but still aiming for a profit closer to my desired margin. 

**Next Steps:**

I will prepare a counteroffer for Bob in Round 3, aiming for a price between $9,000 and $10,000. I will consider the potential for further negotiations and keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500.  This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable sale.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him while acknowledging the need for a price that benefits both of us.
* **Adding Urgency:**  The ""Let's close this deal!"" phrase subtly pushes Bob towards accepting the offer and prevents further rounds of negotiation if possible.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will carefully consider the remaining rounds and John's offer. I might be willing to drop the price further if needed, but I will try to secure a price as close to $9,500 as possible."
