"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I know you'd find it equally valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,750,000.  This price reflects its inherent worth and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further details. ",1750000.0,Alice,1,
