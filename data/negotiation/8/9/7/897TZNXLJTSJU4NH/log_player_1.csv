"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's interest and potentially establish a high starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we'll have to adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell the product for less than its minimum value to me. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this shows flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,600,000.  This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I hope this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give away the product at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,400,000.  While I could potentially get more if I keep negotiating, there's a risk that he'll walk away, or I'll end up having to sell to John for less."
