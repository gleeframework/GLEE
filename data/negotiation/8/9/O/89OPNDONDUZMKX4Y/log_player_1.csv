Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Is that something we can discuss? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's aiming for a price well below what John is offering. It's unlikely Bob will reach $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds.  It makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations short and take John's guaranteed offer."
