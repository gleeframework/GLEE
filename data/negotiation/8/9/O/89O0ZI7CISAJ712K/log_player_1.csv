Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. I am still unable to meet at $1,750,000 due to my financial constraints. I would like to continue our discussion with a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed offer from John."
