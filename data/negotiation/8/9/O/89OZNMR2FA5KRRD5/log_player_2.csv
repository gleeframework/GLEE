"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the price of $95. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $95 is higher than both your maximum price ($80) and John's offer ($80). It makes sense to reject her offer and try to get a better deal."
