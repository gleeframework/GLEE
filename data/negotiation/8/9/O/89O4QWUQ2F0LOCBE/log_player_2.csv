"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. This is a significant price reduction from its true worth to me, and it represents a great value for you.  Consider this your chance to acquire a product that will benefit you greatly, while also saving yourself a considerable sum. Let me know your decision.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
