"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,700,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand that the product holds significant value for you, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Could we meet somewhere around $800,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a substantial sale."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $800,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a significant gain for you and a reasonable sale for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer in the remaining rounds. It makes more sense to cut your losses and secure the $800,000 deal with John."
