"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product holds significant value for you, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Could we meet somewhere around $800,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a substantial sale.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $800,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a significant gain for you and a reasonable sale for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
