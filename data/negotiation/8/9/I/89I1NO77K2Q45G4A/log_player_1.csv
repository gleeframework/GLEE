Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your endeavors.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price while maintaining a collaborative tone. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow more room for concessions. 
* **Market Urgency:** If you're confident in selling quickly to John, you could be more firm on price."
