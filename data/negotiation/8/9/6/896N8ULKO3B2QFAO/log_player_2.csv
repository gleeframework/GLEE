"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I'm willing to let you have it for $18,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item at a price that's still below its true worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($10,000) and John's offer ($10,000). It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save money."
