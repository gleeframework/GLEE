"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value you've stated, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while still providing a significant saving for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I believe this product is truly valuable, and I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a significant profit for you. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still above my target price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  I'm offering $1,050,000. This price is a good compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
