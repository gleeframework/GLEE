"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can definitely do better than $1,200,000.  You have room to negotiate and still save money.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I believe this product is truly valuable, and I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a significant profit for you. Let's work together to finalize this deal.

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high. There's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the bargaining process and potentially secure a better price."
