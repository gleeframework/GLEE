Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential compromise. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $18,000 offer leaves room for a lower counteroffer from Bob. I'm willing to go down to at least $12,000 if necessary.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he's interested, I can use this initial offer as a starting point for further negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John's guaranteed $12,000 offer gives me a safety net. If the negotiations with Bob break down, I have a guaranteed option to secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can use this as leverage in the next round. 
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  John's $12,000 offer provides a guaranteed alternative if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Leverage:** My counteroffer of $15,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low counteroffer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price higher than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about acquiring the product. If he's willing to come up closer to $15,000, it indicates a potential deal.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I still have the option to counter again or accept John's offer, providing flexibility in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum acceptable value. There's no point in risking further negotiation for a potentially small gain.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly better offer. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.
* **Equal Value:** John's offer is also $12,000.  There's no financial advantage to choosing one buyer over the other at this point. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision, as it provides a quick and certain sale at the minimum price I was willing to accept."
