"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down."
