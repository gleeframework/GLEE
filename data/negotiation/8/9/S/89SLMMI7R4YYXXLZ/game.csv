"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm not at liberty to disclose details about its exact nature, but I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer.  Consider this a chance to secure something potentially game-changing for your business.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
