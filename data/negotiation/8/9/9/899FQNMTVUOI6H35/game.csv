,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I need to make a bit more than $13000 to make this worth my while. I'm willing to go down to $13500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, and that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than $13000. How about we meet at $14000, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in going back to $14000, and I'm not willing to consider the extras. I'll meet you at $13000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're getting a bit frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $13000. I'll make one final offer: I'll meet you at $13200, and I'll throw in some additional services to sweeten the deal. This is my last offer, Bob.",13200.0,Alice,9,
