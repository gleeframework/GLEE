Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for a price that reflects its worth.  I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire it at a price well below its true value to you. Let's start the conversation!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I believe I can push for a higher price.  $900,000 is still below my desired value, and I have several rounds remaining to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve a good outcome.  Let's keep the conversation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's work towards a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
  
While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, it's still below my desired value. I've made concessions, and I believe there's room for him to increase his offer further. I have several rounds left and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. While $950,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product at a good price and me to reach a profitable outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired value.  I have more negotiation rounds left and can potentially reach a better price.  I believe there's room for him to increase his offer further, especially since he's already signaled a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This represents a fair compromise that's only a small distance from your offer. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 990000}
