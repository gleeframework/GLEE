"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for a price that reflects its worth.  I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire it at a price well below its true value to you. Let's start the conversation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming to save as much money as possible and $1,200,000 is still far from your target price.  It's better to start negotiating and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve a good outcome.  Let's keep the conversation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my target price.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price.  I still have plenty of rounds left to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's work towards a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. While $950,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product at a good price and me to reach a profitable outcome.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, $1,000,000 is still too high for my budget. I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. I'm determined to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This represents a fair compromise that's only a small distance from your offer. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and her offer of $990,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $975,000.  This is a good deal for me considering my goal to save as much money as possible. It's better to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John for a much higher price."
