Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is a decent price for Bob.  While he might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price isn't worth it.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
