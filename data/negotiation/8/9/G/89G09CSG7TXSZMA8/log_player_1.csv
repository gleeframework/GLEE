"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations.  I'm willing to compromise further, but  I need to secure a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm prepared to accept $1,000,000. This price allows for a fair profit margin for both of us and ensures a successful transaction.  Let's work together to bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
