Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $875,000 is a strong profit, well above your minimum selling price. 
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob has been consistently increasing his offer, indicating his strong interest. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  You've already used 6 rounds.  While you have more rounds, continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or offering a lower price out of frustration. 

Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale."
