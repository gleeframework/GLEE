"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It shows Bob is serious about buying but is also trying to negotiate a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  There are still rounds left, and Bob can continue to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will lower her offer further, or Bob can make a counteroffer closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer, but still staying under his $8,000 limit. Offering $8,750 shows he's serious about a deal but also pushing Alice closer to his target.  He's hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is now offering a price that is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above what he's willing to pay. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to push Alice down to his target price of $8,000.  He has a few rounds left, and with a little more persistence, he may be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit, but he's willing to take one more risk. This counteroffer is a bit bolder, pushing Alice closer to his target price of $8,000. It's a gamble, but Bob is hoping that Alice will be more willing to compromise with fewer rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has two options:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This gets him the product for $8,600, which is a good deal considering his limit of $8,000. He is only paying $600 more than his target price.
* **Reject and counteroffer:**  This is risky.  Alice might reject his counteroffer, and he could end up buying from John for $8,000 anyway.

Given the limited rounds remaining, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer. He's close to his target price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better result."
