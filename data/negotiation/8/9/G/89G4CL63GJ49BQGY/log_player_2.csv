Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.
