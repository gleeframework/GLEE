"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential return on investment.  I could consider a price of $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  However, $950,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could meet you halfway at $775,000.  This offer keeps us both reasonably close to our desired outcomes. What do you say?",775000.0,Bob,4,
