Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential return on investment.  I could consider a price of $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
