Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little too steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
