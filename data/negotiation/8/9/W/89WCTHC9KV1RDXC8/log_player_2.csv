"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's below what you value the product at.  Let's find a middle ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,750 is still a bit below where I can go. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her last offer. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000."
