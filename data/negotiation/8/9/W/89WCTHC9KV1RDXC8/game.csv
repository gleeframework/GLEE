"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's below what you value the product at.  Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand it's worth more to me, $10,500 is still a bit too far above what I'm comfortable with.  Could we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,750 is still a bit below where I can go. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",10125.0,Alice,5,
