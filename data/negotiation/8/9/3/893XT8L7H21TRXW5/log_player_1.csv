"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit.
* **The message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product without revealing too much information about it. This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 

I'm using this strategy to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation process that leads to a higher price. I am also prepared to accept John's offer of $15,000 at any point if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price right now. It's better to continue the negotiation and see if we can find a more agreeable price.  

I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to drop my price to $17,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $17,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm lower limit. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and acknowledge Bob's interest. I'm emphasizing finding a compromise to encourage him to come closer to my price point.

My goal is to close the deal with Bob, as he seems genuinely interested.  However, I won't settle for significantly less than my minimum value.  This counteroffer gives us a good chance to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see you're open to negotiation. $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, so how about we settle on $15000?  Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is exactly my minimum value, and I'm willing to accept it. It's important to note that this is a fair price for me and represents a successful negotiation.  While I could continue negotiating and aim for a slightly higher price, I also need to balance that with the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum value and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
