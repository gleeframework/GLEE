"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something of great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value ($1,300,000 vs $800,000),** meaning there's room for negotiation. 
* **Buying from John is the worst-case scenario ($1,500,000).** It's better to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money.**"

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but the value of this product is significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is now closer to my desired price point.**  I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 from John, and $1,175,000 is significantly lower than that.
* **Further negotiation could be risky.** If I reject this offer and make another counteroffer, there's a chance Alice will either reject it or counter with an even higher price, potentially leading me to buy from John at a higher cost. 
* **Accepting this offer secures a decent deal.** It's a good middle ground and allows me to buy the product without risking a worse outcome."
