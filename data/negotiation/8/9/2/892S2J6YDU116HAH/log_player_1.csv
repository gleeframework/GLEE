Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This offer is also below my minimum value of $1,200,000, allowing for a potential counteroffer from Bob without risking selling for less than my minimum.
* The message is polite and focuses on the value to Bob, creating a positive opening for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're able to offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a higher price, potentially closer to my desired $1,000,000 mark.  

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob.  This will give me more control over the negotiation and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $975,000. This still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$975,000** is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows flexibility while still allowing me to potentially secure a higher price than his offer.
* The message is positive and reiterates my belief in the product's value, subtly pushing Bob towards accepting the counteroffer. 
* It also keeps the negotiation moving forward, avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach an agreement. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $960000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price of $975,000. While I could continue negotiating and try to push for a higher price, there is no guarantee I will get more. It is also possible that Bob will walk away from the deal entirely. Considering my minimum price of $1,200,000 and the risk of Bob rejecting further offers, I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $960,000. This ensures a sale and a reasonable profit without further risk."
