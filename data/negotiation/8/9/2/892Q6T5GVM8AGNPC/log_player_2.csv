"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,500.  This is a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum of $15,000, you know you have a backup option with John.  There's a good chance you can get a better price by negotiating with Alice further or sticking with your option to buy from John."
