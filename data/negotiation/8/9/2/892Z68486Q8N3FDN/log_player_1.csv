Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  This seems like a fair price given your valuation of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider $10,750?  This represents a significant saving for you compared to selling to John and still allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get $11,000, Bob is consistently staying below that.  $10,750 is a reasonable compromise:

* **Significant profit:** It's still a $750 profit over my minimum sale price to John.
* **Time value:**  Dragging negotiations on risks Bob walking away. A deal now is better than the uncertainty of future rounds. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to work with him, which can be valuable for future deals."
