Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong opening price, but it's also open to negotiation. This is a good strategy to potentially maximize profits while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to accept that offer just yet.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows me to achieve a fair profit while also giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $850,000 is a reasonable offer and a good compromise. It's still significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
