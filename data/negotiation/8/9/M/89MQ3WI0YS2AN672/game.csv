"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's benefits. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. I propose a price of $13000 for the product. This still reflects its true value and offers you a good deal. I look forward to your consideration.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to offer you $11000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to work with me.  $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick to my offer of $11000.  It's the most I can do, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",11000.0,Bob,6,
