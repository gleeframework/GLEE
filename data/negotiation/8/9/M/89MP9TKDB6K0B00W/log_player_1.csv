Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product that I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to aim for the highest possible price Bob might accept.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window open for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
