"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially get the product for closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, though.  How about we split the difference and I pay $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget. You want to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer or by buying from John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500. If we can agree on that price, we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know now! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still $3,000 over your budget.  While you've made some progress in negotiations, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price you're comfortable with. You've already tried multiple counteroffers and Alice's final offer is still too high.  

At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation that may lead to a stalemate. You'll save $3,000 compared to Alice's offer and you can be sure you're getting the product for your desired price."
