"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, though.  How about we split the difference and I pay $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11500. If we can agree on that price, we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know now!",13000.0,Alice,5,
