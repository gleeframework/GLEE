"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I value the product,  $100 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $95 for the product. This allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive with your offer. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
