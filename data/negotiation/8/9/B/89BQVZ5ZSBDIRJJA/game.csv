"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $11,000? ",11000.0,Bob,4,
