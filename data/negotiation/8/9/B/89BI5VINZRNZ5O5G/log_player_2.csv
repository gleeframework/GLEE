"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum price. He'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to get this product. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer you $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $95 is closer to his maximum price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He will reject the offer and try to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $92. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate down to his target price of $80.  While Alice has come down a bit, she's still above his maximum.  He's already had four rounds of negotiation, and Alice is showing no signs of going lower. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to simply buy the product from John for $80 and avoid further negotiation."
