"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I mention that the product is ""amazing"" to subtly highlight its potential worth to Bob, without revealing my true minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, it's worth exploring if I can get a slightly higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can nudge him closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a bit more on the sale.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by counteroffering at $9,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a better price.
* **Highlight Value:**  I remind Bob that this is still ""a great deal"" to encourage him to see the value in my product.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm transparent about my reasoning for wanting a higher price, making my counteroffer seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8500 for the product - that's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $8,000 and gets me closer to my desired price point.  It's likely we're near the end of the negotiation, and risking a further counter-offer could lead to a lower price or a deal falling through completely. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
