Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product offers. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,800,000? This takes into account its true value while recognizing your initial interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, however,  $1,800,000 is still  too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly under the product's value to me. While I want to make a deal, accepting $700,000 would be a substantial loss. It's worth countering again to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept."",
""product_price"": 1500000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Holding Firm:**  I'm dropping to my absolute floor price. This conveys seriousness and establishes a firm boundary.
* **Time Constraint:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation, and I need to increase the pressure to reach a decision soon. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm still happy to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
