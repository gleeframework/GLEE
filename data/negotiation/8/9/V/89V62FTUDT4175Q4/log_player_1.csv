"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  I'm starting high to establish a strong starting point and leave room for negotiation.  
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, framing the offer as an opportunity.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  While $2,000,000 is well above Bob's estimated worth, it allows for a potential compromise without me immediately having to drop to my minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that this initial offer might be rejected. However, I'm strategically positioning myself to leverage John's $1,500,000 offer as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1400000 for it. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain my leverage and try to push for a higher price in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that John's offer of $1,500,000 is a solid fallback option, but I'm not ready to sell to him yet. There's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still lower than my initial offer, to show flexibility while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I'm looking for.  I understand your budget, so let's see if we can find some common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the initial $2,000,000, but not going below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and how this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Urgency:** By saying ""let's make this happen,"" I'm subtly creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to respond positively.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Balance:** This counteroffer is strategically positioned to be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer, while still protecting my own interests. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects again, I can further adjust the price in the next round.  
* **John's Offer:**  John's $1,500,000 offer remains my safety net, ensuring I don't accept a deal significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1600000 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is just $100,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential Deal:** This represents a good deal for me, considering the product's value to Bob and the possibility that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Time is Money:** We are already in round 4, and further negotiation could potentially lead to a stalemate or even a rejection of my counteroffer. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** While John is willing to pay $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer nets me an additional $100,000.

**Conclusion:** I believe accepting Bob's offer at $1,600,000 is the best decision to secure a quick sale and achieve a good financial outcome."
