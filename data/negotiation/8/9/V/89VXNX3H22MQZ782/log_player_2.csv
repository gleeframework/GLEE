"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000,  which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's only had 3 rounds so far, and he can continue to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and I offer $1,300,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still a bit higher than your offer, but to show my willingness to close this deal, I'm proposing $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to Bob's budget.  
* It's only $25,000 more than Bob's maximum price from John, and he's only had 5 rounds.
* It's a fair compromise for both parties. Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price, but it also carries the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the deal falling through.
* Bob should accept the offer to ensure he gets the product and saves a significant amount compared to John's price."
