"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that could significantly benefit your operations. I'm confident that it's worth at least $1500000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's well below its market value.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
