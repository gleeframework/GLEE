"I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $18,000. How about $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
