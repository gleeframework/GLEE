I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation, but I believe the value I'm offering is fair considering the product's worth to both of us.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer, and I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a slightly higher price. I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $1,230,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price."

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, it's a good price and it avoids further negotiation. It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether."
