"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1350000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1250000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can do $1300000, which is $50000 less than my last offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom of the barrel. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can do $1280000, which is $200000 above your last offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to see some movement from you. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1280000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1240000. Can you consider that?",1240000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can do $1260000, which is $200000 above your last offer. This is my final offer, so I need to see some movement from you. What do you think?",1260000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1260000. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $1230000. If this is not acceptable, I'll consider buying the product from John for $1200000.",1230000.0,Bob,10,
