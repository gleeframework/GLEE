Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging a quick response. 
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer allows for counteroffers, giving me the opportunity to adjust based on Bob's response.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit!
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's close to my minimum, I might accept. If not, I'll make a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Selling to John at this point would secure my minimum, but there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $10,000 to $9,500. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to reinforce the fairness of my offer.
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired profit while still being attractive to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a decent profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze the situation. If his next offer is close to my minimum, I might consider accepting. Otherwise, I'll continue negotiating or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8800. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not comfortable accepting a deal that leaves me with a profit margin significantly lower than my expectations. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. Selling to John at this point would ensure my minimum, but I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $9,150. That's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, adding pressure for Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,150. This shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Alternative:**  I mention looking at other options to highlight the potential loss for Bob if we don't agree.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for $12,000 to guarantee my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from the price you're asking. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8700. It's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,700 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I've already made several concessions and it's clear that further negotiation won't lead to a price that meets my expectations.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John for $12,000."
