{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than my minimum value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm also trying to build excitement and emphasize the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? I think this price reflects the product's true value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,000, which is still above my minimum but shows some flexibility.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product again, hoping to sway Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum value of $8,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk getting a price below my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000, so it's the most sensible choice at this point."
