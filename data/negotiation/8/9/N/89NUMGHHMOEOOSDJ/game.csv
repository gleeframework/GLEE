"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  Could you consider $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at around $8,000? That's the highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,4,
