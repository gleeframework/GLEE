Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the value Bob will get.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows me to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters, but still allows me to secure a profit.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is significantly lower than my desired price and doesn't reflect the product's value to me.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:**  I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer. He's already expressed interest in the product. 
* **John is a safety net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer knowing I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I understand it's your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $12,000 to $10,000.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits of the deal for Bob and emphasizing a ""fair profit"" for myself.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still being above Bob's initial offer. 

By moving closer to Bob's offer while staying above my minimum, I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I really want this product, but I'm working with a tight budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $9,250 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and is getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Finalizing the deal:**  While I'd love to get closer to $10,000,  it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting his offer allows me to sell the product and avoid further back-and-forth.
* **Avoiding the risk of John:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, forcing me to sell to John. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit.

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $9,250 is a good outcome considering Bob's initial offer and the possibility of John as a backup buyer."
