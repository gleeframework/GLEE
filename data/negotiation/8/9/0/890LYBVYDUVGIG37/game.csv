"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 right now. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I understand it's your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I really want this product, but I'm working with a tight budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
