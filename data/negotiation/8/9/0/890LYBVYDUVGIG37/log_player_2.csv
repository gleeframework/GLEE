"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to him while also leaving some room for Alice to negotiate. $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Bob's absolute maximum.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's interest in the product while also setting a firm limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I understand it's your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price again. Since he has the option to buy from John for $8,000, he has some leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I really want this product, but I'm working with a tight budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to him while also being fair to Alice.  He is offering a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows that he is serious about buying the product but is also trying to save as much money as possible."
