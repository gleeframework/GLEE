"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident that this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the exclusivity of the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $1,000,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However,  the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true scarcity and potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
