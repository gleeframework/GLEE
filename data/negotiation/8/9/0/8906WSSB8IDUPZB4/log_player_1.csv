"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident that this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a price higher than your absolute bottom line. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justifying the Price:**  By highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of its worth at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial offer is high, it's not so outrageous as to be insulting. It leaves space for a counteroffer and a potential agreement within a range beneficial to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the exclusivity of the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $1,000,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value but still significantly below your minimum. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, accepting now would leave a substantial amount of money on the table.  You have ample rounds left to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However,  the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true scarcity and potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** It's important to show Bob that you've heard and considered his position. This helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Holding Firm (For Now):**  The counteroffer is a significant drop from the initial price but still well above both Bob's offer and your absolute bottom line.  This tests Bob's willingness to move substantially.
* **Justification:**  You're continuing to emphasize the product's unique qualities to justify the higher price point.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""a significant concession"" and ""commitment to getting this deal done,"" you subtly introduce a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While you could try to negotiate further, it's getting riskier. Bob is clearly indicating this is his ceiling (""meet you halfway,"" ""fair compromise,"" ""willing to make a deal *at this price*""). 

Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
