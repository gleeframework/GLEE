"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above your stated value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, reflecting the unique benefits this product brings.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000, which is a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm eager to finalize it.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
