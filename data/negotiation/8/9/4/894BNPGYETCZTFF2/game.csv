"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise given your initial offer. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for getting back to me Alice. I appreciate the compromise, but $10,500 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we settle in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
