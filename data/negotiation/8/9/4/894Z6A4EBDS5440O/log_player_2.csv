"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($9,500 vs $8,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* It's also higher than your maximum price ($9,500 vs $10,000).
*  You want to save money, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $9,000. This is still within your budget of $10,000.
* You can potentially get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering again, but there's a chance Alice will walk away.
*  Since you are willing to pay up to $10,000, accepting this offer is a good choice to save money and secure the product."
