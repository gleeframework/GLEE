"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $150. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a great price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible and I know I can buy the product from John for $150, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice."
