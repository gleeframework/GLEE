Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This price is higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but I'm hoping to get a better price than John's offer. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
