"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but Alice is asking for $925,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price.**  You can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down. 
* **Buying from John is not the best option at this point.** While you're willing to pay $1,000,000, you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $887,500? This would represent a significant saving for you compared to my initial ask, while still reflecting the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.**  Even though it's a reduction from her initial offer, $887,500 is still a bit too high.
* **You have a better chance of getting a lower price.**  You've already shown that you're willing to negotiate and Alice has demonstrated flexibility.  There's room to push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a worse option.**  While John's offer is guaranteed, there's a chance to save even more money by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
