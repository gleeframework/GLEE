"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $925,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still well above your stated value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $887,500? This would represent a significant saving for you compared to my initial ask, while still reflecting the value of the product.",887500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $887,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $868,750. This price is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product fairly.",868750.0,Bob,4,
