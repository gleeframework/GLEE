,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $75? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $75 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? This would be a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
