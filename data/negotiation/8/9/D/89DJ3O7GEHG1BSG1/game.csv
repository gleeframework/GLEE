"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the progress we're making. $10,750 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
