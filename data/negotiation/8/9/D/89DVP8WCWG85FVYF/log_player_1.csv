Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal, allowing you to capitalize on its value while providing me with a suitable return. Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for Bob ($50,000) incentivizing him to accept. It's unlikely he'd find a better deal elsewhere if the product's worth to him is truly $1,200,000.
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides you with a strong negotiating position. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial constraints.  If you had additional insights, you might adjust the offer accordingly."
