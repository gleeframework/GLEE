Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for your product.  This price allows for a good margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get closer to my desired price. While $1,300,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can close the gap further."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still $150,000 below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach a deal.  If not, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
