"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we try $900,000? I think that's a fair price that considers both our positions.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand your perspective on the price, and I'm aiming for a deal that benefits us both.  How about we settle on $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a compromise. I'm still aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you consider $925,000?  I think that's a strong offer.",925000.0,Bob,6,
