Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,025,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we try $900,000? I think that's a fair price that considers both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $900,000 is a significant amount, I believe the product's value to Bob warrants a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at the risk of dropping below my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand your perspective on the price, and I'm aiming for a deal that benefits us both.  How about we settle on $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a compromise. I'm still aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you consider $925,000?  I think that's a strong offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1 million, $925,000 is a solid offer. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether. It's time to close the deal."
