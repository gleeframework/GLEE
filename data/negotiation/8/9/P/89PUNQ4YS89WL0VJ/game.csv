"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm open to negotiation. How about $140?  That's a good compromise, and it's still less than my initial offer.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a little high at $140. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $120 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $130, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make it happen!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really trying to stay under $120. How about we split the difference at $125?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Bob,6,
