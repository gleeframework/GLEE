Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be extremely valuable for someone in your position.  I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $20,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob specifically, which might make him more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
