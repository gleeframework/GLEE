"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than its full value, and I'll still be making a good profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $8,000.  You have room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and open the door for her to potentially come down closer to her actual valuation."
