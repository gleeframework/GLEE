Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling to John for $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing my profit.  
* **Appeal to Value:** By calling it a ""special price,"" I subtly imply it's a better deal than he might find elsewhere.

By starting high but not unreasonably so, I increase the chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
