"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if his offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it immediately. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm reducing my price by a significant amount but still aiming for a profit. This shows flexibility but also demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's initial offer.  I believe this price is reasonable, considering I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price and higher than what John is offering.  While I'd love to get even more, I'm happy to secure a profitable deal.  I'm also mindful of the limited rounds remaining and don't want to risk losing a deal altogether."
