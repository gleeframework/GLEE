"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation and potential concessions. It also gauges Bob's eagerness and provides insight into his perceived value of the product. 
* **Strong starting point:** Aiming high initially (50% above my minimum) sets a strong tone for the negotiation. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves ample space to come down during the 10 rounds if necessary.
* **Gauging Bob's response:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will be very informative. 
 
Remember: While we want to maximize profit, we also want to avoid alienating Bob entirely and losing him to the backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested in the product. Would you consider $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. Accepting this would mean settling for far less than what the product is worth. It's crucial to demonstrate that I also value the product highly. Round 2 is too early to concede so drastically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I can accept. This product has considerable value for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,875,000?"",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting the lowball:** Bob's offer was a clear attempt to anchor the negotiation extremely low.  Rejecting it firmly is essential.
* **Signaling willingness to negotiate:**  By proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and his, I demonstrate flexibility and a desire to find common ground.
* **Still a strong price:**  $1,875,000 is a significant profit margin above my $1,500,000 minimum and remains closer to my initial offer, maintaining a strong negotiating position.

We are still in the early stages of negotiation. This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to a realistic price while demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we settle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that considers both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is moving in the right direction, it's still below my $1,500,000 minimum. Accepting it wouldn't be maximizing my potential profit. 

* **Progress but not enough:** Bob is clearly negotiating and acknowledging the product's value, but his current offer is still not acceptable. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  It's important to demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for maneuver:** We still have several rounds left, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal. 

We'll use the next counteroffer to try and steer the negotiation closer to the $1.5 million mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference again and land at $1,625,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise from both sides."",
""product_price"": 1625000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the momentum:** We're building a pattern of meeting in the middle, demonstrating fairness and encouraging Bob to do the same. 
* **Strategically approaching the target:** This offer is now only $125,000 above my absolute minimum, increasing the pressure on Bob while keeping the deal attractive to me. 
* **Testing Bob's resolve:** By now, we're getting a feel for Bob's negotiation style. This offer will reveal if he's willing to move substantially closer to my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  How about we make this really simple - $1,425,000 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is now within a reasonable range of my $1,500,000 minimum. 

* **Strong profit:** While not ideal, this price still nets a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Dragging the negotiation out further could lead to a stalemate, especially if Bob is becoming less flexible.
* **Time value of money:**  Closing the deal now allows me to reinvest the earnings sooner rather than later. 

While holding out for another round or two *might* yield a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal and accepting John's backup offer."
