Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,300,000. This gives us both a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000 and we have a guaranteed option with John at $1,200,000.  It's better to secure the deal with John and save the $50,000."
