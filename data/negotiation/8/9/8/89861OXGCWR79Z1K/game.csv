"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,300,000. This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
