Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can always come down slightly. 
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a premium price reflects the potential ""cost"" of going to John â€“ it might take more time and effort to finalize the deal with John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price attractive enough for Bob to accept and high enough to secure a significant profit for Alice."
