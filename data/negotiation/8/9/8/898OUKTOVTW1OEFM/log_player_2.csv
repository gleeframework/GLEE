Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a truly valuable item. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at her minimum, and I can likely get a better price.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you're willing to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved a bit closer to my desired price, $1,250,000 is still too high. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm still feeling a bit too high at $1,250,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can get to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her minimum price of $1,200,000.  This is close to my maximum budget, and while I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned about running out of time. It's likely that John will be willing to negotiate a better price than Alice is at this point.  I'm going to cut my losses and buy from John."
