"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value in this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. $12500 is still a bit high for me. However, I see the value in this product.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11250?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11250. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
