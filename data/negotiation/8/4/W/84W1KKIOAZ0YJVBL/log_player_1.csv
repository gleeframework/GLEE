Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While my offer is strong, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, potentially increasing my profit.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $150 might make Bob feel like I'm taking advantage of his high valuation. $140 seems fair and allows both of us to benefit.
* **Secure the Sale:** I'm aware of John's offer, but prioritizing Bob at a higher price makes sense before settling for the guaranteed $120."
