"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a large portion of the value Bob sees in the product.  $950,000 is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of a potential bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $950,000 by continuing the negotiation. Selling to John for $800,000 right now is not a good option, as I can potentially earn more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with a price of $925,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This strategy helps keep the negotiation moving forward and maintains my position of power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I have a few rounds left and don't want to settle for a price that's significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a last resort if I can't secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $900,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground, which could encourage Bob to accept the offer. It also positions me to potentially close the deal this round, avoiding further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. We have only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal that's significantly below my desired price. If Bob doesn't come up, I can always sell to John for $800,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to secure a better price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final concession by lowering my price to $875,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement. It also balances my desire to get a decent price with the risk of Bob walking away and me being stuck with the $800,000 deal from John.  With only 3 rounds left, I want to increase the likelihood of a deal being reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $825,000 is too low for me. It's also unlikely he will raise his offer significantly in the next round. Since I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, and the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is high, I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000. This ensures a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of ending the negotiation with no deal."
