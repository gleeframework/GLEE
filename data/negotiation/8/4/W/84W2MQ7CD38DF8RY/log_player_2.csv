"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for a counteroffer before resorting to buying from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the special price, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $100?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $110 is a good deal considering your maximum budget of $150 and the fact that John is selling it for $150.  There's little point in continuing to negotiate, as you risk Alice getting frustrated and rejecting further counteroffers, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
