"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make a counteroffer. However, $10000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
