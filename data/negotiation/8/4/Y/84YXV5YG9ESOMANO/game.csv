"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price closer to $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price reflects both our needs and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this number.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",920000.0,Bob,4,
