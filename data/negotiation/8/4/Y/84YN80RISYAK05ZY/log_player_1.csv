Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. He might be willing to go slightly higher, and even if he counters, we can likely settle somewhere above $150.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. There's no pressure to go below our minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay beyond his initial perceived value."
