"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This represents a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $2,300,000 represents its true worth, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,950,000? This considers both our positions.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
