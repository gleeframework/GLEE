"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but you might be able to do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating. This price is still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price and within my budget. While I might be able to negotiate a bit lower, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John for a higher price."
