"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is still a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $1520000. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
