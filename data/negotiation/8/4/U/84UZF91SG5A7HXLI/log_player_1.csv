"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, but still below what it's worth to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to go lower than my initial price, but $14,000 is below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This still leaves room for you to get a great deal. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $16,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $15,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially try to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up with nothing.  It's a good deal, and I'll take it."
