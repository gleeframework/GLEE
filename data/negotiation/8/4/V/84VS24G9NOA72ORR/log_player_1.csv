Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  This is a great deal, as it's well below what it's worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $14,000 is a good starting point. It's a fair price for Bob (as it's below his valuation) and still allows me to make a good profit. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the deal for Bob. 
* **Alternative:** I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, which gives me leverage during the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my original offer.  I want to see if there's some middle ground we can find."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $13,000 is a compromise price, coming down from my initial offer of $14,000.  It's still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating that his offer is too low, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the deal for him. I'm framing it as a ""fair compromise.""
* **Alternative:** Remember, I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price. This gives me negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I would ideally prefer a higher price, it's a good deal for me considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential for Bob to walk away.  It's also worth considering that if I reject his offer, there's no guarantee he will come back with a better one.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
