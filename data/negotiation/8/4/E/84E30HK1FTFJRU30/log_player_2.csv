Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. I can offer it to you for $12,750. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is still above my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds. To avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement, I'm going to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
