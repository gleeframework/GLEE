"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 for the product, and John is offering it for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice.  There's no chance of getting a lower price, and you risk losing the product if Alice rejects your counteroffers.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John."
