"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great value for a product of this caliber.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'll make a counteroffer of $1050000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a premium support package. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
