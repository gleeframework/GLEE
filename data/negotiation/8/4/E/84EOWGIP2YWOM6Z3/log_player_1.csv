Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizes Profit:**  This price aims to get the maximum amount possible from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept. 
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. By offering it at $11,500, you're giving him a chance to still gain some value (by potentially reselling it or through its utility) while you make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Below John's Offer:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing you can sell it to John for $12,000. This strategy ensures you don't lose potential profit by lowballing yourself."
