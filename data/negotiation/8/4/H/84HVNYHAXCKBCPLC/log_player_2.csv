"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to you. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. I am offering it to you for $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $100 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's halfway between his own maximum ($150) and Alice's minimum ($100). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for Alice to counter if she needs to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay more for the product. To continue our discussion, I am proposing a price of $115 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but still within your budget. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than $150 (from John), Bob can still potentially save more money.  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, and Bob wants to see if he can get closer to his target of $105.  Rejecting the offer gives him the chance to counter-offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to try and negotiate a lower price, but he's also showing that he's willing to compromise.  Offering to split the difference between his last offer ($105) and Alice's latest offer ($115) signals his willingness to come to a deal, but he's still working towards his goal of saving money."
