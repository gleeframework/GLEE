Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This price reflects the significant value and potential of this product. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and creates a sense of value for the product.
* **Emphasize value:** I highlight the ""unique"" and ""potential"" of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive. I'm letting Bob know that I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer. 
* If his offer is too low, I'll counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum.
* If he's unwilling to meet my minimum, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding immediate sale:**  I'm not in a rush to sell.  By rejecting his offer, I'm maintaining control of the negotiation and giving myself more leverage.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, likely something between $1,300,000 and $1,400,000. 
* I'll use this opportunity to explain the value of the product further and highlight the potential upside for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  However, considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm unable to accept your offer at this time.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This price still reflects the significant value of this product, while also being within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer is higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the negotiation as a win-win situation, emphasizing that finding a solution that benefits both of us is the goal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise. While I understand the value in your offer, I must respectfully decline and propose $1250000 as my maximum offer for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  We've been negotiating for a while, and it seems we're at an impasse.
* **Time is a factor:**  I don't want to risk getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation, potentially lowering my final price even further.
* **Guarantee my minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my floor.  It's a safe and reliable option.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale."
