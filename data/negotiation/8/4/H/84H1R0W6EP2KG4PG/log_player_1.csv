Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $145. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering it at $145 gives Bob a small discount, making it more enticing while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback buyer (John) willing to pay $100, ensuring you won't be stuck with the product if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still presenting Bob with an offer he's likely to accept."
