Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $20,000, which is above my minimum value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Open to negotiation:** I explicitly state I'm open to negotiation to avoid appearing inflexible.
* **Personalization:** I use ""amazing"" and ""appreciate"" to make the message more personal and engaging.
* **Asking for thoughts:** This encourages Bob to respond and provides an opening for further dialogue. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a positive and open way, while still positioning myself to get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $15000 or less. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's a chance I can get a better offer from Bob if I reject his initial proposal.  
* **No immediate need for John:** Since John is also offering my minimum, there's no immediate need to sell to him.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:** This might make Bob more willing to increase his offer.
* **Explore further negotiation:** I can try to get closer to my desired price through counteroffers.

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his $15,000 offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $17,500 for this product, considering its unique value. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's budget:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's budget constraints, showing understanding and willingness to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer higher than Bob's:** I'm offering $17,500, which is halfway between my initial $20,000 and Bob's $15,000 offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the ""unique value"" of the product to remind Bob of its potential worth. 
* **Open to finding common ground:** I end by inviting further negotiation and seeking a mutually agreeable price.

By offering a middle ground and emphasizing the value of the product, I aim to:

* **Increase Bob's willingness to negotiate:** This counteroffer shows I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintain a reasonable asking price:** I'm not going too low, and still have room to compromise further if needed.
* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:** This counteroffer allows me to continue engaging with Bob and potentially secure a higher price than his initial offer."
