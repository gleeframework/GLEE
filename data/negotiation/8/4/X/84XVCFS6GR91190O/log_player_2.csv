"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than your $15,000 limit. You have 9 rounds to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see where Alice stands.  $13,000 is a solid discount from her original price, and should give us room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is closer to my limit, it's still not ideal. I'll try to get a lower price in the next round.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to avoid buying from John if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm going to offer a price halfway between Alice's last offer and my maximum limit. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still keeping some room for a possible final discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, I'm still not willing to accept it. There's still a chance for a better price, and I'm not going to give up yet. I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay my maximum limit for the product, but I'm not going to go any higher. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy from John."
