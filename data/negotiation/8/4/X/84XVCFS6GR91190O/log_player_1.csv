"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a strong starting point, allowing me to see if Bob is seriously interested and gauge his potential willingness to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer downward in subsequent rounds.  I'm also keeping in mind my safety net of selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can potentially get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round, aiming for a price that's still favorable but more aligned with my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this price will be attractive to Bob while still leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a higher offer. I have a few more rounds to go, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $15,500. This is a smaller adjustment from my previous offer, showing that I'm getting closer to meeting Bob's price point.  I believe this offer is fair and leaves room for a potential agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Bob's offer is close to my target price, and I'm only a few rounds away from my safety net with John. Accepting this offer will guarantee a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on this sale by continuing to negotiate."
