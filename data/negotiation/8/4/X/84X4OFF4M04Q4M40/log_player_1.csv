Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you at that price, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value.  $1,200,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers. This is a fair price, considering its potential.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. $1,150,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident that I can get a better price. I have 6 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower and not reaching my minimum acceptable price.  While there are 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000. It's better to secure a certain profit than to keep negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
