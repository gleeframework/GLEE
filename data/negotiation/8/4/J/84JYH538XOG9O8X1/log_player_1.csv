Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is higher than the $1,000,000 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** $1,200,000 is still above your minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring you don't lose money. 

This strategy allows you to see if Bob is willing to negotiate and potentially reach a price that benefits both of you. If he rejects the offer, you can adjust your counteroffers or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I'll see if I can negotiate with Bob for a higher offer before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering what you're getting, and it's a good starting point for us to finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,200,000, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $1,200,000,  Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is just above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can still make a profit with this deal.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale."
