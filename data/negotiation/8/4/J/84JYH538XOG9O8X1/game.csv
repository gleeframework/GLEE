"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering what you're getting, and it's a good starting point for us to finalize a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,200,000, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
