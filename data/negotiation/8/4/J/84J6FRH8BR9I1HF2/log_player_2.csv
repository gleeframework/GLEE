"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality product at a very competitive price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down further in price, getting you a better deal. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
