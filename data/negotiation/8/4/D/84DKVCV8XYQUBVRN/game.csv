"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $65 is probably a bit low.  How about $75?  That's a pretty good deal!",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we try $85? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
