"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're committed to your offer of $850,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $925,000, which is a 15% discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While $925,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to close the deal.  I'm hoping you can see this as a win-win situation.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can sell the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",950000.0,Alice,7,
