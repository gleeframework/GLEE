Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

Reasoning:

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate and creates the impression that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $14,000, I signal that I'm open to negotiation and willing to come down in price. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't have to go below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm better off countering in hopes of meeting somewhere in the middle. John's offer acts as a safety net, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help move the negotiation toward a close.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps me above my absolute minimum price while still offering a potential compromise for Bob.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By countering, I keep the negotiation active and signal that I'm serious about selling, but not desperate enough to accept an unfavorable deal."
