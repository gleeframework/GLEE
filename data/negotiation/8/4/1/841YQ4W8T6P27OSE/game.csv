"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too low for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's close the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
