Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
