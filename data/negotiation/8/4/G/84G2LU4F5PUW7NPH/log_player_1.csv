Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to counteroffer, but I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, as I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,500. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping to close the deal at this price, as it's very close to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk further lowering the price.  I'm confident that John will buy the product at my minimum price, so I'll sell to him instead."
