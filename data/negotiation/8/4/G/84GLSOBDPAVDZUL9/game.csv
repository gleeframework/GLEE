"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go as high as $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'll offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
