Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and for you to find a price you both agree on. 
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's not too aggressive, but it shows you're confident in the value of the product. 

Let me know what happens next!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $135?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is slightly below what I'd hoped for, it's still a decent profit and significantly better than selling to John. There's a chance Bob might reject this offer, but it's unlikely he'll come back with a better one.  I'll take the $130 and move on."
