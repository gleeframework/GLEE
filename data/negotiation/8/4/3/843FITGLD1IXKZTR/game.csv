"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a fair price for it, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $10000, but I'm not ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you and my own minimum requirement of $8000.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay $10000, and I'd like to reiterate that. I'm not willing to go above that price. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
