"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite high. I'm interested but only around $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. To be fair to both of us, I can consider coming down to $1,100,000. This is a significant adjustment on my end, reflecting my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial sum and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. While $700,000 is still lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer reflects my desire to strike a deal while ensuring a fair price for a product of this caliber.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  It's a firm offer, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
