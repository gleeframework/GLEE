"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite high. I'm interested but only around $600,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a better deal. 
* **Signaling Interest:**  While the offer is significantly lower than Alice's, it shows you're serious about buying but need a more reasonable price.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. If she's completely unwilling to budge from near her asking price, it might be more efficient to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. To be fair to both of us, I can consider coming down to $1,100,000. This is a significant adjustment on my end, reflecting my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 limit and John's offer. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial sum and demonstrates my serious interest in the product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer moves closer to your $800,000 limit while still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for your counteroffer, emphasizing the ""substantial sum,"" might make it more appealing to Alice.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer helps gauge if Alice is willing to move closer to your acceptable price range. If not, you can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. While $700,000 is still lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer reflects my desire to strike a deal while ensuring a fair price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly moving towards a more agreeable price, but $950,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer.  There's no harm in trying one more counteroffer closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  It's a firm offer, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  You've been negotiating, and it's time to be direct. This message clearly states your maximum budget.
* **Urgency and Clarity:**  By saying you're ""ready to close the deal right now,"" you add a sense of urgency and finality.
* **Walk-Away Point:** This offer lets Alice know you have a viable alternative (John) if she doesn't accept. It might prompt her to accept rather than risk losing the sale entirely."
