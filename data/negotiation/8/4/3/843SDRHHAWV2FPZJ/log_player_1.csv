Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  A high initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup.
* **Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the $20,000 price, you've maximized your profit significantly beyond your $15,000 minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. You have a strong alternative with John, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer."
