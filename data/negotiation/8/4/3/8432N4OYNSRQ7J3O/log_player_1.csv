Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum price of $120, leaving room for negotiation.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if he's interested or if I need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while potentially appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still slightly less than my counteroffer, I think it's a good compromise. Selling to John for $120 would be less profitable, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
