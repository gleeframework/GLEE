Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $18,000. Can you meet me in the middle?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $12,000 is too low for me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm worried it's taking too long and I might not get a better price. John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with, so I'm going to take that option."
