"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll get from owning this product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make concessions, but I'm still not willing to pay more than $950000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,6,
