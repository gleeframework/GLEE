"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $180 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you at $140, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
