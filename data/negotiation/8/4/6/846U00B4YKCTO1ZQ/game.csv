"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth while leaving some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product, given its value to me. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  While $900,000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still above my minimum, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This price would allow us to both walk away with a fair deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiation. While I value your interest, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000 as a final compromise.  Let's reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.  I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This would be a win-win situation for both of us, allowing us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
