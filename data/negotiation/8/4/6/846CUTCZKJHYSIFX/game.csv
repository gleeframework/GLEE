"Bob, I understand that you're looking to keep your investment within $10000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $17500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $17500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel it's a bit high. Could we perhaps aim for $15000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,
