"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
