"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, it's still above your ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer gives you leverage to negotiate a better deal with Alice.  You can likely get a price closer to your $100 limit without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, while still being a reasonable amount for her given her value of $80. This shows Alice that you are serious about getting a better deal, but are not trying to exploit her.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above your ideal price point. You can likely get a better deal with continued negotiation, especially since you've already established a lower price point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue working towards your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already lowered her price once, showing a willingness to negotiate. By offering $87, you're showing good faith and demonstrating that you're willing to meet her halfway, but still aim for a price that is closer to your preferred range. This counteroffer is likely to be accepted by Alice, as it's only slightly below her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, showing a willingness to compromise. While $92 is still above your ideal price point, it's closer than her previous offers.  Since we're already past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, accepting the offer seems like a safe bet. It's likely that continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it's also possible that Alice will become less flexible and we might end up buying from John for $100.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product within your budget while avoiding the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from her."
