Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $140, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$140 offer:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and increase the chances of acceptance. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Keep options open:** If Bob rejects, I can still negotiate further or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is still below my minimum of $150:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's not yet acceptable.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.

By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, maintaining leverage and maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $135. This is a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from $140 to $135, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:** I use ""great deal"" to make the offer seem appealing.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Move closer to my minimum:**  $135 is closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It allows for potential further negotiation if Bob rejects.
* **Increase likelihood of acceptance:**  By being reasonable and friendly, I increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again, or perhaps even $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to push Bob much higher.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

It's more efficient and less risky to sell to John at this point, as there's no guarantee of getting a better price from Bob."
