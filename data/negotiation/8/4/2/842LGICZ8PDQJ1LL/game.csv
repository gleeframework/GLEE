"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider lowering the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair deal considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a bit out of my budget, I would like to propose $8,500 as a compromise. This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $9,500. This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and I think it's a deal that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer of $9,500. While it's closer to my budget, I would like to propose $9,000 as a counteroffer. This would allow us to reach an agreement without exceeding my financial limits.",9000.0,Bob,6,
