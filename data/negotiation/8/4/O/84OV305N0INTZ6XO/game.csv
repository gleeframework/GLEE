"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. My next offer is $1050000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and your initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. That's still $200000 below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. My next offer is $1080000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
