Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm confident he'll at least counteroffer because $10,000 is a high price, and I can then try to meet somewhere in the middle. If he rejects my initial offer outright, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
