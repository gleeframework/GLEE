Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you something truly exceptional.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiating from a position of strength is key. By starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you leave room for negotiation while establishing the product's importance.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exceptional"" nature and ""true worth"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value closer to your asking price.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  While starting high, you signal willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the process. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John waiting in the wings, ensuring you're not desperate to close a deal at any cost.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  I'm interested in the product, but a more realistic price for me would be in the $600,000 range.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. While his counter-offer was expected, going as low as $600,000 indicates he's aiming for a much lower price point. You have a strong alternative with John, so you can afford to negotiate from a stronger position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Still Above Minimum:** This counter-offer demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but not at the cost of a major loss.  
* **Reiterating Value:**  By emphasizing the ""true value"" and ""unique opportunity,"" you're continuing to anchor the price closer to your desired range.
* **Firmness:**  Setting a clear floor with ""can't go any lower"" implies you're serious and may walk away if necessary. This tactic can sometimes encourage the other party to negotiate more earnestly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I can go as high as $700,000, but that's really my limit.  It's a fair offer considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. More importantly, his negotiation tactics suggest he's unlikely to dramatically increase his offer. He's anchoring his offers to his perceived value ($800,000) and using budget limitations as leverage. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000, continuing with Bob carries more risk than potential reward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a fair deal. However, I can't go any lower. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This clearly signals that you're nearing the end of your negotiation flexibility. 
* **Compromise but Firm:**  The price is a significant drop, showing you're trying to find a solution, but it's still well above Bob's offer, emphasizing your bottom line.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that you're not desperate and are prepared to walk away. 

This strategy aims to get Bob to understand the seriousness of the situation and potentially elicit his best and final offer."
