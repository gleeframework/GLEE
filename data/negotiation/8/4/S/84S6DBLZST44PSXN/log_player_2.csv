"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is looking to spend no more than $8,000. Alice's offer is far too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go above $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than the initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. There's room for further negotiation, so it's worth rejecting and trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm serious about wanting this product, but my absolute top is $9,000.  If we can reach a compromise, I'm ready to buy today."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the price down to his $8,000 limit.  Alice is getting closer, but it's worth seeing if she'll go lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I'm very interested in this product and we can finalize the deal if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're very close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but she's still $2,000 over his limit.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  Bob should take the sure thing and buy from John."
