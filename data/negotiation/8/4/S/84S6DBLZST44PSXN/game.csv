"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still too high for me.  I'm serious about wanting this product, but my absolute top is $9000.  If we can reach a compromise, I'm ready to buy today.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $9500?  I'm very interested in this product and we can finalize the deal if we can agree on this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
