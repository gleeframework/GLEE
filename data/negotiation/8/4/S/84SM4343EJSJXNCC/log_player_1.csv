{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, even exceeding the price I'm offering it to you for. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $10,000, but that doesn't directly influence my initial offer.
* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $19,000 as possible. Starting high gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net. I don't need to settle for less than $15,000. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While I know Bob's valuation, he doesn't know mine. This asymmetry of information is key to the negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer is just the first step. I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects this initial price. I could offer a lower price, but I want to gauge his reaction first."
