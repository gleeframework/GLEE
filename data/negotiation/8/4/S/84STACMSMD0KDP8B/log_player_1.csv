Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a great price for a product of this quality.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired earnings. I'm going to counter Bob's offer one more time to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go any lower than $115. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'd be willing to meet you at $110, as I mentioned before. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where the negotiations with Bob aren't leading to a satisfactory price for me. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I make a good profit."
