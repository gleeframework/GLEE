"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in the product, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1150000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for you as well. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1250000. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it reflects the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1250000. It's getting closer to where I can comfortably purchase the product. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1225000.  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we can complete this transaction. Let me know what you think.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1225000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1260000. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it reflects the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1260000.0,Alice,5,
