Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your floor price of $1,200,000. 
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:** Leaving room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting at a super low price, which might make Bob think the product is worth less than it is.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have room to negotiate further, and you might be able to get closer to your ideal price.  Let's see if you can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** You're not simply sticking to your original offer.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:** It's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** You're not giving Bob an easy ""out"" to reject and walk away."
