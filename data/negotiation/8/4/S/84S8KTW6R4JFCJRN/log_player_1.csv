"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message focuses on the benefits for Bob and emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The question at the end invites Bob to counter and keeps the dialogue open. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still being open to negotiation and avoiding a potential stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **More negotiation potential:**  I still have 9 rounds to reach a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's low offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and keep the negotiation going, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a great deal. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can make this work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** While $1,050,000 is still above Bob's offer, it demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" Bob gets at this price, subtly reminding him of the product's value.
* **Positive tone and compromise:**  The message aims to keep the negotiation amicable, showing a willingness to find a solution.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and encourages Bob to reconsider his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now at his maximum:** Bob has reached his perceived value for the product, and I'm unlikely to get a higher offer from him.
* **Time is ticking:** We are already in round 4, and I only have 6 rounds left before I need to make a decision.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I choose not to accept Bob's offer, but the risk of losing a sale to John in later rounds is increasing.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, provides a decent profit, and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob before I need to sell to John."
