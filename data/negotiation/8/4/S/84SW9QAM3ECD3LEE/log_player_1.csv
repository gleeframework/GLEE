Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Gauge the Waters:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. His response will give you a better understanding of his perceived value of the product. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John's offer in mind ($80) provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent offer, it's still below the initial asking price and leaves room for further negotiation. Bob's message indicates he's interested but trying to stay within a budget. There's a good chance he might be willing to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll be happy with."", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're signaling a willingness to negotiate by lowering the price from $120 to $105. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $105  positions it as a compromise and a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This counteroffer still allows for a good profit margin above our minimum ($80)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still looking to keep the cost down. Would you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $100 is a solid profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Bob is clearly price-sensitive and may not be willing to go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now secures the sale and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
