"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close the deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,
