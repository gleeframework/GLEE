"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting too far apart. I can offer it to you for $17000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I've given it some more thought, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, this is your last chance to make a deal.",16250.0,Alice,7,

"I've reached my limit of concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $16250. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm still open to negotiations, but I need to see some movement from your side.",16250.0,Alice,9,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $15800 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",15800.0,Bob,10,
