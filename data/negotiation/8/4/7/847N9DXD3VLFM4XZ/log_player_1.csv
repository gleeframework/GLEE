Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob wants to counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a brief justification for the price to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiating. 

**Important Notes:**

* **No Guarantee of Sale:** While this approach maximizes potential earnings, it doesn't guarantee a sale. Bob might reject the initial offer, and the negotiation could go on for a while.
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John and ensure a minimum of $12,000 profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer for a higher price. I'll aim for a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's, hoping to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counteroffering at $16,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying the price by mentioning the value of the product, emphasizing that it's still a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm again emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to find a mutually acceptable price. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions, hopefully leading to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $14,500 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still below my initial goal, it's significantly higher than John's offer and represents a good compromise.  It's worth accepting this offer and securing a sale, rather than risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
