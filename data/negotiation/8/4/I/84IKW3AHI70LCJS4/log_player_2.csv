"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $900,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within his budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay John. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  I believe this price is fair, as it reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being fair to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000.  While it's closer, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Bob can likely secure a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $825,000 is a fair price, reflecting the value of the product to me while still providing you a good return. Let's work together to bridge this small gap and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $860,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $860,000 is still above Bob's target price of $800,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob has already reached a point where it's more beneficial to buy from John at $800,000. This ensures he achieves his goal of saving money and secures the product within his budget. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks exceeding his budget or wasting valuable time."
