"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  I believe this price is fair, as it reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being fair to me.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $825,000 is a fair price, reflecting the value of the product to me while still providing you a good return. Let's work together to bridge this small gap and finalize the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $860,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my costs.",860000.0,Alice,5,
