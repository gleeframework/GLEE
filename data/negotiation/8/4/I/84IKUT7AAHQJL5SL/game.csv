"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,150,000, so I'm thinking of a price of $1,125,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
