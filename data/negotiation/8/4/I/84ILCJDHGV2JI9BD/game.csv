"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand the value it brings, $850,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value it holds for me. I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings to your business and make it worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
