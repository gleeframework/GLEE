"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to your company. I'm asking for $1000000 for it. I'm confident it can generate significant return on investment. Let's discuss this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $750000 is a significant amount, it's below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1000000. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. Can you consider this compromise?",825000.0,Bob,4,
