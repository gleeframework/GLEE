"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is still above my maximum budget but represents a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
