"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know holds great value for your business. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950000. This reflects a fair value for both of us, considering the product's worth to you and my own minimum requirements. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This price still represents a good value for both of us, considering your minimum requirements and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find common ground, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $900,000.** This is still less than buying from John for $1,000,000. 
* **Further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly lower price.**  Bob has already made a counteroffer and been rejected, so Alice is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but also a firm stance on her desired price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $900,000 is the most financially beneficial option for Bob at this point."
