"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This price still represents a good value for both of us, considering your minimum requirements and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find common ground, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction.",900000.0,Alice,3,
