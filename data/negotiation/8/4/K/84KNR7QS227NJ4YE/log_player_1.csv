Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows a willingness to negotiate, which is important to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $65 is more than Bob's perceived value, it is significantly less than my minimum price of $120. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.50} 
```"
