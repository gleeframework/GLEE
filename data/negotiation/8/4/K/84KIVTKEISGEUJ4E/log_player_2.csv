"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than that. What do you think?

While $1,050,000 is better than the initial offer, you can still push for a lower price. It's worth seeing if you can reach a compromise closer to your desired $1,000,000."

# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1,075,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to make this deal happen.

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is getting closer to your desired price. It's likely that further negotiation won't get you much further, and you're already saving a significant amount compared to John's price. Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
