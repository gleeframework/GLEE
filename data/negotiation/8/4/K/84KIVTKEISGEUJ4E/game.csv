"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in exploring this further. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference:  I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value you're offering and the price I'm willing to pay. What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1,075,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
