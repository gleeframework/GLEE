"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000,  which is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,900,000 represents a fair value in my eyes, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle somewhat. How about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
