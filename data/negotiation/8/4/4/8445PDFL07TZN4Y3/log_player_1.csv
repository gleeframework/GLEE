Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's still early in the negotiation and Bob's offer is too low, considering the value to him. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to compromise.  My new offer is $1,125,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.  "", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the new offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price, and we're still early in the negotiation process. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of him walking away completely or the potential of lower offers in the future."
