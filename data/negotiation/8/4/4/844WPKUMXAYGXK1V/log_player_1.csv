I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. 

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate up to a price that is mutually beneficial. However, I am prepared to lower the price or even sell to John if Bob is not interested in a deal close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a price that's more advantageous for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,500. This is a significant step down from my initial offer but still leaves room for a reasonable profit. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob while remaining in a comfortable range for myself."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob has clearly shown he's not willing to budge on his offer, and continuing to negotiate seems unlikely to result in a higher price.  While I would prefer to earn more, selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
