"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Bob's maximum price is $10,000, and Alice's offer is $9,500.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he offers a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Be polite but firm:** Bob expresses appreciation for Alice's offer while also stating his price point.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While this counteroffer is bold, it still leaves room for Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $9,000 is still above Bob's comfort zone. 
* **More room for negotiation:** There's still a gap of $1,000 between their positions, indicating that further negotiation is possible.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If Bob can't get a better price from Alice, he can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to go to $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's latest offer and Bob's previous offer. It shows Bob is willing to negotiate but still wants a good deal.
* **Maintain politeness:** Bob expresses appreciation for Alice's flexibility while remaining firm about his price point.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** Bob frames his offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Alice's sense of reason."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's limit:** While $9,200 is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's only $200 away from his maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiations seem to be stalling:**  Alice has made several concessions, but it's unclear if she'll go lower. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Slight profit for Alice:** Alice will still profit from the deal, but the price is fair for both parties."
