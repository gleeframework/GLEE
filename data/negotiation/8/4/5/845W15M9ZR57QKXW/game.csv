"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe $950,000 is quite high. Based on my research and budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could be flexible and consider a price of $875,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my current financial situation and market research, I am unable to meet a price higher than $750,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
