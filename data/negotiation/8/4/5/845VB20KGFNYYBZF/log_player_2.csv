"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that this product holds a significant importance to me, reflecting its true worth at $15,000 to you. However, considering the unique circumstances and aiming for a mutually beneficial transaction, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is a fantastic chance to secure a high-quality item at a price slightly above its market value but still significantly below its perceived worth to you. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's story about the product's value is irrelevant. It's clear she's trying to negotiate a price higher than your fallback option of buying from John for $15,000. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay above your limit. She may come back with a better offer, or you can stick to your plan of buying from John."
