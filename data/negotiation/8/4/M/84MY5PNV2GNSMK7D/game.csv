"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price of $12,000 as possible.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. Considering your offer of $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,500? I feel this represents a fair compromise and brings us closer to a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $10,800. This is a compromise that gets me closer to my minimum price of $12,000, while still being reasonable for you. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. $10,800 is close, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $10,000. However, I prefer your product and would be happy to close the deal right now for $10,200. It's my final offer.",10200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere for $10,000, but I'm confident that my product is of higher quality and has unique features that make it worth the extra cost. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer of $10,200 and my minimum price of $12,000. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $11,100. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of my product while still being reasonable for you.",11100.0,Alice,7,
