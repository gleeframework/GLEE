Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going over $17,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet there. Would you be willing to meet me at $17,500?

It's unlikely Bob will go any higher. Accepting $17,500 is a better outcome than potentially losing him and having to sell to John for $15,000."
