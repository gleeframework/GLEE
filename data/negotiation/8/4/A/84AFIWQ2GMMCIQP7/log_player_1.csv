{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a decent profit while still being reasonable.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to take this deal to avoid further negotiations and secure a sale."
