"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However,  $900000 is higher than I'm currently willing to pay.  I'd like to propose a price of $650000.  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase, and I believe it's still a fair offer considering the value I see in the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product's value is significant. Considering your offer of $650000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $800000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,3,
