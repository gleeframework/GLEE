"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,100,000. I am willing to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must stick to my budget. I am now proposing a counteroffer of $1,000,000.
