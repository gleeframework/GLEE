"Alice, while I see the potential in this product, your starting price is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, showing my genuine interest. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
