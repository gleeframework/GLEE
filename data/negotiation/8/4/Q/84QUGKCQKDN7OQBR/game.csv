"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you!",82.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $79.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you!",79.5,Alice,5,
