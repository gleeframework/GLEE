"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential benefits. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
