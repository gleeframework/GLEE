"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and might give Bob the impression that the product is even more valuable. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:**  This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will provide valuable information for the subsequent rounds of negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind the standing offer from John at $800,000. This offer acts as a ""safety net,"" ensuring we don't settle for a deal significantly below the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is far above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. I'll reject his offer to signal that I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident that with strategic counter-offers, I can get closer to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise. It shows Bob I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than his offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By suggesting $900,000, I'm positioning the negotiation closer to my desired outcome. This leaves room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds, potentially settling on a price between $800,000 and $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  If this is acceptable to you, I'm ready to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I initially aimed for a higher price, accepting his offer of $800,000 is the most logical decision at this point. 

* **Matching Offers:**  Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation further carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a guaranteed $800,000.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting this offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could lead to a positive future business relationship with Bob."
