"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is far above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $900,000 is still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  If this is acceptable to you, I'm ready to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
