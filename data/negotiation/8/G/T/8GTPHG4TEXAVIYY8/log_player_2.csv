"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14000.  This is a great price, considering its true value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is $1,000 less than John's price.
* **The product is worth more to Bob:** Even though Alice is selling for a price higher than her own valuation, it's still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John."
