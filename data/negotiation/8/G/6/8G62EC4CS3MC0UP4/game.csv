"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about $70? That's a fair price.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $85. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and do $77.50?",77.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $77.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $77.50, which would be $81.25. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",81.25,Alice,7,
