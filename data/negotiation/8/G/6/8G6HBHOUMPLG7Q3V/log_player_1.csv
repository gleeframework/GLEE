Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80) but below his maximum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have a backup buyer (John) at $80, aiming higher with Bob first maximizes your potential earnings."
