Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Negotiation is key.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to your target, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You're running out of time:** This is round 9, leaving only one round left.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of not closing the deal at all.
* **The price is still too high:** While Alice has made concessions, $1,007,500 is still above your $1,500,000 target. 
* **The potential gains are small:**  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a significantly lower price in the final round.

**It's more prudent to buy from John at $1,500,000. You're guaranteed a purchase and avoid the risk of losing out entirely.**"
