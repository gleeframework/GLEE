Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, Bob is strategically moving towards a middle ground and we are already above my minimum. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer in future rounds or me having to settle for John's offer."
