Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $500,000 profit margin if you can sell it above your minimum.

**The Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his perceived value) while maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be slightly bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I've done my research and know its value is significant to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000 before I finalize an agreement with another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message aims to create a sense of urgency and value. 
* **Price:** The price is $50,000 below Bob's perceived value, giving him a strong incentive to accept. At the same time, you secure a $1,450,000 sale, significantly exceeding your minimum. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust, but always keep your $1,500,000 baseline in mind."
