Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently undervaluing the product and inching up in small increments.  While he might eventually meet a price closer to my desired range, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000 within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees the full value and avoids further negotiation."
