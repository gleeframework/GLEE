"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds to work with, and John is a reliable alternative at a price that meets my needs.  It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired price range with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still leaving a comfortable margin. My goal is to find a middle ground where Bob sees value and I achieve a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,150,000 is still too low. I want to see if I can push for a bit more before considering selling to John. I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to make a final push for a price closer to my desired range.  I'm offering a price of $1,550,000, which is only $50,000 less than what John is offering. Hopefully, Bob will be convinced to accept, as this is a more favorable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has stalled. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll come up to my desired range. I've already made a significant concession in the previous round, and it seems unlikely Bob will increase his offer. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the most secure option, guaranteeing I reach my minimum acceptable price.  I can't risk further rounds with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price, or with no deal at all."
