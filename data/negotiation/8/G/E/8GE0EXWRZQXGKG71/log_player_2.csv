Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must inform you that $900,000 is still a bit low for me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently rejecting your offers and counter-offering with very small decreases. It's unlikely she'll go below $1,050,000 at this rate.  While John's price is higher, you're running out of rounds and risking a stalemate with Alice. It's better to secure the product now from John, even at a premium, rather than potentially missing out entirely."
