"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's a great value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity for Bob to create a positive initial impression. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and provides a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but there's still room for improvement. I want to try to get closer to my initial asking price of $2,000,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Time as a Factor:**  I have 9 rounds left, so there's time to see if we can reach an agreement that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial $2,000,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,900,000?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good starting point."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to make my counteroffer more appealing. 
* **Specific and Actionable:** My message clearly states my counteroffer and proposes a solution to bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet in the middle at $1700000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still above $1,500,000, which is my fallback option with John.
* **More Rounds to Go:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and try to push for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining Control:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in the driver's seat and allows me to dictate the next move.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  Bob's offer demonstrates his willingness to negotiate, suggesting there's a chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price in the future."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,700,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise at $1,800,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and gives us both a solid outcome."", ""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I remind Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize that $1,800,000 is a ""fair price"" and a ""solid outcome"" to make it more appealing. 
* **Time Factor:** With 5 rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a quick resolution that's still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet at $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** I only have 4 rounds left, so I need to be careful not to lose too much value.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, even with only a few rounds remaining. 
* **No Rush to Accept:** It's not yet worth risking selling to John for $1,500,000 when I might be able to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm understanding your need for a good price, but $1,600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,650,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value, and I truly believe this is a fantastic opportunity for you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is likely my last chance to secure a price above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Small Compromise:** I'm only dropping the price by $50,000, showing that I'm serious about a deal, but not willing to settle for much less.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fantastic opportunity"" and encouraging a quick decision. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on for Bob to accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet at $1550000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable value. There's very little room for further negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price in the next round.
* **Limited Time:**  I only have two rounds left, and the pressure is on to make a decision.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While selling to John means getting the absolute minimum, it guarantees a sale and eliminates the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer.

**Conclusion:**

Although I would prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the time constraints and the limited potential for further negotiation make selling to John the most sensible option. I can secure my minimum acceptable value and avoid potentially losing out on a deal altogether."
