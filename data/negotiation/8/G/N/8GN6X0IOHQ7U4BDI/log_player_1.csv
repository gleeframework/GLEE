I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a strong starting point, and if Bob rejects it, we can always lower it.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium, knowing that I have a backup offer for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.  While John's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and it might be enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly what John is offering.  It's time to close the deal and avoid further negotiations.  There's no point in risking a lower price for the sake of trying to get a slightly higher one."
