"Alice, your offer is very tempting, but unfortunately, it's a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident this product is worth a lot, but my maximum budget for this purchase is $950,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value to both of us, and it's a final offer from me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the fact that you've already made a significant compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
