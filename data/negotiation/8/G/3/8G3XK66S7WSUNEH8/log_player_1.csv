Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000, which is a bit higher than the product's value to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate if he counters. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate because the product is worth $10,000 to him, and he can potentially get it for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's slightly lower than my preferred price, it's still a good deal.  I'm happy to sell to Bob for $9,000."
