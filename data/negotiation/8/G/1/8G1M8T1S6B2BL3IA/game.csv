"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $7,500? This still leaves room for you to get a good value, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $7,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,750 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $7,125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",7125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle at $6,937.50?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",6937.5,Bob,6,
