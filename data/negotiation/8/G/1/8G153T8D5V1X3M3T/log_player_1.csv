"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening position that allows for potential negotiation while still reflecting the product's high value to me.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a guaranteed sale, it's only worth my minimum price. I'm not interested in settling for the minimum right away, and I'd like to see if I can push Bob to a higher price.  I'm not in a rush, as I can always sell to John for the same amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It also allows for further negotiation while still being above my minimum price. I believe this is a good balance between getting a decent price and not scaring Bob away completely."
