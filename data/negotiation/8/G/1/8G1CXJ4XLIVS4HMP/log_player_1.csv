"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500.  I have nine more rounds, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves a significant profit for me. I believe Bob might be willing to accept this price as it's closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for $7,500.  I'm going to continue negotiating. If Bob continues to offer less, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to accept $7,000. Since I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, I'm going to take that option. It's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
