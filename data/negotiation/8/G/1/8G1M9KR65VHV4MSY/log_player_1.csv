Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product would bring significant value to your operations, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. By offering it at $1,100,000, I leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000).
* **First Refusal:**  Offering Bob the product first at a premium price is a strategic move. Even if he rejects the initial offer, it sets the stage for potential counter-offers and keeps him engaged in the negotiation process.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $800,000 if Bob declines, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
