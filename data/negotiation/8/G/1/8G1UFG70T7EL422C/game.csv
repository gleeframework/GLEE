"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves a good margin for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
