I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

$12,500 is still a good price, but I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,500.  This is a compromise between our initial positions, and hopefully, it will be enough to persuade him to close the deal."

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John for $10,000 is still a good deal, and it guarantees a sale without risking further negotiation."
