"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. How does $95 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good starting point, you can likely get a better deal. You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92. This would be a great deal for you and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. You can still try to get a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's still room to negotiate.  You can aim for a price closer to $90 in your next counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $92. However, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. How about $91? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 91}
