Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. How does $95 sound?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92. This would be a great deal for you and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $92. However, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. How about $91? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have liked to get closer to $92, I've already gone through a few rounds and $91 is a good price. It's closer to my minimum of $80, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
