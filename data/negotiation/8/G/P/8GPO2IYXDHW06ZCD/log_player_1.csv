Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. Bob has been firm at $1,350,000, which is still below my minimum of $1,500,000.  With only two rounds left, the chances of him budging significantly are slim. 

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  Although I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's more important to secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements.  John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting stuck with a lower price."
