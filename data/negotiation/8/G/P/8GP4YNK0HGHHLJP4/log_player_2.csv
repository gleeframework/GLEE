```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we split the difference and try $13,500? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate you staying in the conversation.  However, $12,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. While $11,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.
