"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's important to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly opening builds rapport.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning ""amazing"" implies the product is worth the price. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  A $17,000 price point allows for some negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum goal of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $10,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.  It's better to reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise in the next round. I still have 8 rounds remaining and the option to sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we split the difference and try $13,500? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:**  Starting with ""I understand"" shows empathy and helps maintain a positive tone.
* **Offering a Compromise:**  The $13,500 price is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  ""Worthwhile investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's potential benefits. 
* **Maintaining Room for Negotiation:** This price still allows for potential further negotiation if necessary, while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. I have several rounds left, and John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate you staying in the conversation.  However, $12,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** Starting with ""I understand"" keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Emphasizing Costs:**  ""Doesn't cover my costs"" reinforces the importance of my minimum price.
* **Compromising Slightly:**  Offering $14,000 shows flexibility while still being above my minimum goal.
* **Focusing on Fairness:**  ""Fair price"" implies that this is a reasonable compromise for both parties.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to respond and continue the dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. It's a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While he's shown a willingness to increase his offer, it's not enough to meet my needs. I have four rounds left, and John is still a reliable option for a sale at $15,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal or go with John's offer in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. While $11,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This price acknowledges your budget while allowing me to cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** ""I appreciate your efforts"" maintains a positive and cooperative atmosphere.
* **Acknowledging Progress:** ""Step in the right direction"" shows that I'm recognizing Bob's efforts to compromise.
* **Offering a Compromise:**  $13,000 is a midpoint between Bob's last offer and my previous one, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focusing on Value:** ""Worthwhile"" emphasizes that the price needs to be sufficient for both parties.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Encourages Bob to respond and continue the dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting a bit closer to my limit here.  $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000, which is significantly better than what Bob is offering.  It's time to take the sure thing and move on."
