"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $10,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we split the difference and try $13,500? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate you staying in the conversation.  However, $12,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. It's a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. While $11,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This price acknowledges your budget while allowing me to cover my costs.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting a bit closer to my limit here.  $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,8,
