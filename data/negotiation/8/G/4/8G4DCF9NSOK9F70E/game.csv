"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this. It's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this is a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $9,200 is closer to my asking price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference again and I'll accept $9,350. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that you get a valuable product at a good price. What do you think?",9350.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9,225. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9225.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to get at least $9,275 for this.  Let's close this deal.  This is a fair price, and I know you'll be happy with the product.",9275.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9,250. I think this is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9250.0,Bob,8,
