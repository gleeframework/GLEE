Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try and push for a higher number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,475,000.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1475000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $1,300,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try and push for a higher number.  I have enough time to negotiate with Bob, so I'm not going to rush into a deal that doesn't feel right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle again at $1,400,000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's final offer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm not willing to give up $200,000 just to close the deal quickly. I'll make one last counteroffer in the next round, and if Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm stance, but I can't accept $1,300,000. This is my final offer: $1,350,000. It's a compromise, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree, I'll have to look elsewhere.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I've made a serious offer of $1,300,000. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to budge, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's not as much as I wanted, but it's still a good deal, and it's better than settling for a price I'm not comfortable with."
