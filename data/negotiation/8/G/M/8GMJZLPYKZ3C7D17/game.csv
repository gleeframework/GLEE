"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe it would be a great fit for your needs. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is quite high, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
