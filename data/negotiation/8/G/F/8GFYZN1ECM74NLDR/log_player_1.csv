"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $180. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm confident the product is worth more than $120 to Bob, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more from Bob. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm lowering my price to $150, which is still a good profit for me, but more appealing to Bob than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a fair price for the product, considering I can sell it to John for $120. I'm accepting the offer to maximize my earnings."
