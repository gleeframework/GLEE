"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. ",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is still well below what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is getting close to where I need to be. How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,250,000?  This price would be a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I'm willing to bump my offer slightly to $1,200,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
