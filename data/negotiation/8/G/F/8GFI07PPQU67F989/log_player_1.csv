"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is still well below what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite at the level I'm comfortable with. I want to see if I can get a little closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer, and hopefully, we can come to a mutually agreeable solution."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is getting close to where I need to be. How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,250,000?  This price would be a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting close! I'm willing to bump my offer slightly to $1,200,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

This is a good deal for me.  Bob has finally met my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  I'm confident I'll get a better price in the future, but it's always nice to get things done quickly and efficiently."
