"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer.  It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation if Alice is willing to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is slightly higher than her initial offer.  While it's still cheaper than buying from John, it's not the best deal possible. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There's still room to bargain since Bob's willing to pay up to $10,000 and Alice's bottom line is likely closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice rejected Bob's previous offer of $8,500, showing she's willing to negotiate but not drastically lower than $9,000.  Offering $8,750 is a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to move but still keeping some room for Alice to meet him in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,350 is only slightly lower than her previous offer, and it's now very close to Bob's maximum price.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation is high.  Alice might continue to raise her price, and Bob might not be able to get a better offer.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $10,000,  guaranteeing him the product while potentially saving time and effort on further negotiation."
