"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value to both of us. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, we believe it's worth $1,500,000 to you. However, to facilitate a smoother transaction and considering the current market conditions, I am offering you this opportunity at an exclusive price of $1,350,000. This offer is designed to ensure that both parties benefit from this deal. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,350,000
* **Your Maximum Value:** $1,500,000
* **John's Price:** $1,500,000

You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John if you can't reach a better deal."
