I'm offering Bob the product for $9,000.  This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $8,000.  This strategy allows me to potentially earn more money, while still having a backup option."
