"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $145. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $145 is closer to Alice's value, you can get the product for $120 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and pursue the better deal."
