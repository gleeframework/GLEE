Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $145. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, but she also wants to avoid losing the sale to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $145 creates a tempting offer for Bob. He gains $25 of perceived value ($145 offer vs. $120 value to him). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is Alice's starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate further down. However, the risk is minimal, as the offer is already very attractive to Bob. 

By starting high but leaving a small margin, Alice increases her chances of securing the best possible price for her product."
