"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price that would benefit both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This is a fair price that gives you a significant value and allows me to reach my target. Let's make this deal happen.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $812,500 is closer, I think to make this work for me it needs to be a bit lower. How about $793,750?  This keeps us moving towards a fair deal.",793750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to a deal.  I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $793,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's seal this deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
