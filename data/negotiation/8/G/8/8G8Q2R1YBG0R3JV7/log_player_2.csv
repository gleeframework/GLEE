"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at over $1.5 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer.  My initial offer is $1200000.  Let's start the conversation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  You have a maximum budget of $1,500,000, and there's room to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 2

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My counteroffer of $950,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my seriousness about negotiating.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I believe we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from owning the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both bring to the table.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While $1000000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $1050000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the immense value this product brings.  I believe this is a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that shows my genuine interest in the product, while still fitting within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
