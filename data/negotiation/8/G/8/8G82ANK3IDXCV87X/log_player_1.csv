Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position, as it leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me. I'm confident that I can secure a price that is at least as good as John's offer of $1,500,000. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I am not willing to settle for the bare minimum. I believe the product is worth more than $1,500,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but it still reflects the value I place on the product. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in this offer and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than John's offer, and while I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm satisfied with this outcome.  It's time to close the deal!"
