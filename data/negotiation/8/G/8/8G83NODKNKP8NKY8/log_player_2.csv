# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. Alice might come back with a lower offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
