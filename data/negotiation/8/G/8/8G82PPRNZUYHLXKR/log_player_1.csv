Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer needs to be significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer to make it worth Alice's while to risk Bob rejecting the deal."
