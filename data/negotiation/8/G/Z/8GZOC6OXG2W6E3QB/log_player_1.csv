Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, but I'm also aware that Bob has a lower valuation of the product.  A price of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $950,000 is still too low for me, given my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much further.  I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial offer, and at this point, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the more profitable and less risky option."
