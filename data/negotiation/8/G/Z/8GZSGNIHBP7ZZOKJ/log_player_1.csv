"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it allows room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 as possible within the 10 rounds.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price downwards in subsequent rounds, but I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,700,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, or at least provide a basis for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still not comfortable accepting $1,100,000.  It's too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob and see if I can get him to budge. If we can't come to an agreement, I can still fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  It's a significant reduction from my last offer, but still above Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and will move us closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round. I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

We're at a crucial point now. I'm dropping my offer down to my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this is my final stand and that we're close to an agreement. If he rejects this, I'll have no choice but to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob refusing to budge, I've reached the point where I can't afford to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant amount and ensures I don't end up with nothing."
