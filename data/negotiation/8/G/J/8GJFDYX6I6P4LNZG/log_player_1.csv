{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum of $10,000.  It also shows I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I can likely get more.  I'll try a counter-offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This still allows me to cover my costs, and it reflects the significant value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $10,250 is a good compromise and still above my minimum.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
