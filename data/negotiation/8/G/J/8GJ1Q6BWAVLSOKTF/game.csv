"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price, considering the value I'm placing on the product and my budget.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm not willing to go down to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll sell the product to you for $12250. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
