Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $12,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,500 is still too low for me, and I want to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $13,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,000. While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price of $14,000, it's important to remember that Bob is a good potential customer, and this is a good price.  I don't want to risk losing him by being too stubborn, especially since there are only a few rounds left."
