Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **John as Backup:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John if Bob refuses.

Therefore, aiming for a price slightly below John's offer ($119) maximizes the chance of Bob accepting while still exceeding Bob's perceived value and securing a profit for Alice."
