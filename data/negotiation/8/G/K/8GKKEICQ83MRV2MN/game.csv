"Bob, I understand your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is simply too far below my value.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,050,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
