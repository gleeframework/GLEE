Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $13,500."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit from Bob, who values the product significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $13,500 offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down while still keeping you well above your fallback price of $8,000. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price point. 

This strategy balances ambition with a touch of realism, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale at a price significantly higher than your guaranteed offer from John."
