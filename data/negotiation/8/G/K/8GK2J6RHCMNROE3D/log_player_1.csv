{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $100 but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied.  It also gives Bob a good reason to accept quickly, as he knows he's getting a good deal at $130."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Could you do it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's still a great price for a product worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
