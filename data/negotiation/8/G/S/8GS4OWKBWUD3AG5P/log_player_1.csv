"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I'm hoping to get as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he might be willing to negotiate a bit higher. I'll be watching closely for his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to $17,000, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I still believe I can get a good price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already in round 4 and time is ticking.  $16,500 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
