Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a competitive offer considering its potential return on investment. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Alice knows the product's worth to both Bob and her fallback buyer (John), she starts with a strong offer closer to her desired outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" without revealing specifics, aiming to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, the phrasing suggests openness to discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Strategic positioning:**  This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice is still guaranteed her minimum desired amount from John."
