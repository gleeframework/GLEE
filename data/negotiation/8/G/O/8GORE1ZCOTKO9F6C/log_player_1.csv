Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,350,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm willing to counter his offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my acceptable range. I'll push a little further to see if I can get closer to $1,400,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

It's time to accept.  Bob is unlikely to move much higher and $1,375,000 is a strong price, exceeding my minimum.  It's better to secure the deal now."
