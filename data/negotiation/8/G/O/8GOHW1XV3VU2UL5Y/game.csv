"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit margin while still letting me get a fair price for something that's very valuable to me.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still allows you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
