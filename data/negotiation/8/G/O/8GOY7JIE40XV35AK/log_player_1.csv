Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still attractive to Bob, while maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Negotiation Space:** Leaving room for negotiation allows for potential compromise without completely jeopardizing my desired profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to me strengthens my position and encourages Bob to see the value.
* **John as a Backup:** I can always fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin and the value I place on the product. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore further negotiation with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired $1 million.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm not willing to abandon the negotiation with Bob yet. A counteroffer might bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering you the product for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but also demonstrating flexibility by presenting a counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:**  The price of $925,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not giving up entirely on my target price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel there's room for negotiation. I am willing to pay $875,000 for your product, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing Gap:**  Bob's offer of $875,000 is closer to my desired price, but it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly better offer, but the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of a protracted negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is both safe and lucrative.  It's a more reliable outcome than continuing to bargain with Bob. 

Given the circumstances, I believe selling to John is the most prudent decision at this time."
