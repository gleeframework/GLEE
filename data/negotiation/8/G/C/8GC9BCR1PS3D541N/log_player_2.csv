"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose the exact details right now, I assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another interested party.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for a much lower price."
