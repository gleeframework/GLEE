"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than the price you'd pay John ($1,500,000).  This means accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000. Even though you could save more if you haggled with Alice, the goal is to save *as much money as possible* and get the product.  Since Alice's offer is better than your alternative, you should accept."
