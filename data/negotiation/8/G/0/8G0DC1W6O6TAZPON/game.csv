"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects your interest. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference at $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us make a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",8875.0,Alice,5,
