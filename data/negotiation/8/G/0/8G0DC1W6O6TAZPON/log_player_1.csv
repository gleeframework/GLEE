"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $9,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects your interest. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference at $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still have a few rounds left and want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I think I can get closer to $9,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8875}
