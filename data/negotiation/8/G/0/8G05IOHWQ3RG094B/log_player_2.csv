**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, or simply buy from John at $1,000,000."
