"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $980,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",980000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $980,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $930,000?",930000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $930,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $960,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for you.",960000.0,Alice,5,
