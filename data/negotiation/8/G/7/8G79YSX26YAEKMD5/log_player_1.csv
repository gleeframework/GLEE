Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $120 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the product's value and the offer being a ""great price,"" making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation open.
* **John as a Backup:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $150 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about $85?  That would make it a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $85 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even significantly less than the initial offer of $120.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. I can use this to negotiate a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than John's offer to incentivize Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer of $100 is a compromise, showing I'm flexible but not willing to accept Bob's low price. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the product's value to justify the price, reinforcing its worth.
* **Open to Final Agreement:** The message uses ""What do you think?"" to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to agree. 

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer creates a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  
* I'm still above my minimum price but leaving some room for a final deal before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, there's still room for improvement.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, giving me the power to push for a better deal from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price between $90 and $100, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum without risking losing Bob entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  This would be a good deal for both of us and get this transaction finalized."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This offer is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90.  It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both parties, making it more appealing.
* **Finalizing the Deal:** The message suggests that this could be the final offer, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

* This offer is a strong negotiation tactic, aiming to secure a price close to my minimum while still leaving room for a small concession if necessary.
* I'm still above my minimum price of $150, but I'm aware that John is waiting in the wings if negotiations with Bob fail."
