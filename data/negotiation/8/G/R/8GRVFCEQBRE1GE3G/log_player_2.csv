"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get the product for a lower price. He has room to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my initial price.  How about $13,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $13,500, which is within his budget and a better price than John's offer.  While he could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll get a significantly lower price, and risking a deal with Alice could mean he ends up paying John's higher price."
