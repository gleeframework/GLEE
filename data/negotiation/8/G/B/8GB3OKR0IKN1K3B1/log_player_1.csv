Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a substantial profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob seems firm on his price ceiling and is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,075,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and a reasonable compromise. Holding out for more risks losing the deal entirely."
