"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 feels reasonable. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much money as possible and has a limit of $1,500,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a substantial profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe its worth is significantly higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  He's still trying to save as much as possible and has room to negotiate further.  Rejecting this offer will allow him to continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's aim for a final deal here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's settle this at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the significant value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $1,100,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  It's important to remember that Bob can always choose to buy from John for $1,500,000, so there's no rush to accept a deal that's not favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good compromise that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
