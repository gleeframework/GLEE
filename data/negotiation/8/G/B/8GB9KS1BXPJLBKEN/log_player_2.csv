"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's better than John's price, it's still above your target of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. 

**Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $20 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant drop, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** You haven't gone all the way down to your target of $80, giving Alice room to counter without feeling pressured. 
* **Sets a clear expectation:** Your message clarifies your current position and encourages Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within your budget:**  Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget of $150.
* **Small price difference:**  The difference between Alice's offer and your target price of $100 is only $10, which is a reasonable compromise.
* **Time is a factor:**  Accepting this offer means you can secure the product without further negotiation and avoid the risk of losing it to another buyer (John).

**Strategy:** Accepting the offer allows you to get a good deal while minimizing the risk of a longer negotiation or ending up with a worse outcome by buying from John."
