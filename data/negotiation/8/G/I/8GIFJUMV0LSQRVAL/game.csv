"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product,  as it aligns with its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my assessment of the product's potential and market value is considerably higher.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering the value to me, and I believe it reflects a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be transparent,  $1,500,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go for this product. I've already had a strong offer at this price, but I believe in finding the right fit for what I'm offering. If you're unable to meet that, I wish you the best in your search for an alternative.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
