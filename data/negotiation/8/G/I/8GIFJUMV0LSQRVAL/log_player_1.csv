"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you.  I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This classic negotiation tactic leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique features"" and ""significant asset"" aspects, I'm aiming to anchor the value in Bob's mind at a higher point.
* **Open for Discussion:**  The tone remains collaborative and open for discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product,  as it aligns with its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is expectedly low, matching his stated perceived value. Accepting this would be a significant loss. While I have the option to sell to John for my minimum, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my assessment of the product's potential and market value is considerably higher.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show I'm listening but stand firm that my valuation is much higher. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  While a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still comfortably above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but keeps the price point anchored high.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the ""market value"" argument aims to shift Bob's focus from his subjective valuation towards a more objective standard.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  Framing this as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering the value to me, and I believe it reflects a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now above his initial valuation, indicating a genuine interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to signal that a substantial increase is needed.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet as there's still room to potentially reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be transparent,  $1,500,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go for this product. I've already had a strong offer at this price, but I believe in finding the right fit for what I'm offering. If you're unable to meet that, I wish you the best in your search for an alternative."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealing the Bottom Line:** By revealing my minimum acceptable price, I'm showing Bob I'm serious and not bluffing. This can encourage a more realistic offer from him.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning the other offer (even if hypothetical) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. It subtly lets Bob know this isn't his only opportunity.
* **Final Offer Tone:**  While open to a deal, the language suggests this is likely my final offer, prompting Bob to make a decisive move. 
* **Remaining Professional:** I maintain a respectful tone even while being firm, keeping the door open for a deal if Bob meets my valuation."
