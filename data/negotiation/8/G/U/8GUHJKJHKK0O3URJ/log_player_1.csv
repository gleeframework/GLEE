Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, potentially justifying the higher price.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. You could experiment with different prices and messages to see what yields the best outcome."
