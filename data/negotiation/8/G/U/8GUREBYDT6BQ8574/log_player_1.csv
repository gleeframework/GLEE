"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. It's below my minimum value, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll try to counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counter-offering at $130. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm still optimistic that I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering at $125.  This is only $5 above my minimum value, but I think it's a fair compromise, especially since we're nearing the middle of the negotiation process. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable final offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating with Bob.  Even though he's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not sure I can push him any higher, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell to John. 

Selling to John for $120 ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of a lower offer in the remaining rounds."
