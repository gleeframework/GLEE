"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair and competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is above her valuation, it's significantly lower than John's offer ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000). Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 and is within your budget."
