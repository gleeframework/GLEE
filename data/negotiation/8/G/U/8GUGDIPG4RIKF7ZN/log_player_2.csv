"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's wise to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $1,500,000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000 for the product. It's a great compromise that still reflects its value, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than the alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000 for the product. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what Bob could get from John ($1,000,000).  While it's getting closer, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target or a better deal than John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. This is a significant amount, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1000000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm thinking of a price of $1075000 for the product. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is only willing to go down to $1,075,000, which is still higher than what Bob could get from John for $1,000,000. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking getting stuck with a price higher than John's.  It's better to cut his losses and go with the sure thing from John."
