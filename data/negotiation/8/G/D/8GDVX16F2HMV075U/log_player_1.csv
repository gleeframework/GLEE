"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting at $12,000, it allows for several rounds of negotiation without me having to immediately drop below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and confident tone:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which might make him more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product has a high value to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I have 10 rounds, and rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer signals that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer above Bob's offer:** I'm countering with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my starting price.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob, as it is closer to his perceived value than my original offer.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm using language like ""let's make this happen"" to encourage Bob to see the value of continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:** $10,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited time:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing too much time negotiating when I can secure a decent price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  If I keep rejecting, I risk running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John for a higher price."
