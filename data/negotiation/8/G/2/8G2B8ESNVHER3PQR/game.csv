"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",25000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $25000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,18000.0
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10000. This is a fair offer considering the price I'm willing to pay from another seller.",10000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,15000.0
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to sell at $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $18000, which is $14000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is a fair price for the product and will allow us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,16000.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $18000, which is $15000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product offers. However, I'm also keeping an eye on other interested buyers, so I need to make a decision soon.",15000.0,Alice,7,,
