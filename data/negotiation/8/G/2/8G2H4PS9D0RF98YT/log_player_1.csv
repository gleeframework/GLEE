{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob is not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made significant concessions.  I've reached a point where it's no longer worth it to continue negotiating with Bob.  It's better for me to sell to John and ensure that I get my minimum value."
