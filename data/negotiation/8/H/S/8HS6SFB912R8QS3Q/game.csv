"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, as the product is worth that much to both of us. I know you'll be happy with this acquisition. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is also willing to pay that price.  Let me know your decision!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
