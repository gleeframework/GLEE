Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $95 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($100), giving him room to negotiate if he wants. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a bit of negotiation and hopefully a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $85 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than what you initially offered. Rejecting his offer gives you an opportunity to make a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for it. How about $90? It's still a good value for you and closer to what I need to make this worth my while."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and your needs, I am comfortable offering $87. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is only $3 less than your initial offer of $90. While it's not ideal, it's still above your minimum of $80 and above what John is offering. Accepting this offer will secure a sale and give you a decent profit."
