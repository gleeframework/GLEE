"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm sure you'll see its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. This gives Bob a sense of the potential value of the product.
* **Positive Language:** The message is positive and focuses on the opportunity for Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my minimum, allowing for multiple rounds of negotiation. 

I'm aware this might be a risky move, but it's a strategy to see if Bob is truly serious about acquiring the product and to gauge his potential budget.  I'll monitor his reaction and adjust accordingly in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I need to try and push for a higher price.
* **Potential for Higher Value:** Bob's willingness to make an offer suggests he sees value in the product. I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting his offer now would mean settling for less than I could potentially earn.  Continuing to negotiate keeps the pressure on Bob.

I'm going to counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, to encourage him to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. Let's try $900,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and we can finalize the transaction quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit.  It's a significant drop from my initial offer but still well above Bob's.
* **Urgency:** Emphasizing a quick transaction can create pressure for Bob to accept, as he may not want to risk losing the product to another buyer (John). 
* **Value Justification:**  Reiterating the value of the product and the ""great deal"" aspect helps reinforce its worth in Bob's eyes. 

I'm confident that this offer will either lead to an agreement or provide valuable information about Bob's upper limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to be close to your asking price, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my absolute minimum price. There's no reason to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Closing the Deal:** Bob is ready to close the deal today, which means I can secure my desired price without further delay. 
* **Avoiding Uncertainty:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price.  Bob might walk away, and I would have to settle for selling to John.

By accepting this offer, I'm securing the best possible outcome in this scenario, given the information available."
