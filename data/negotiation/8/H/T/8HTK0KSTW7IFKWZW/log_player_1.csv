Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to explore maximizing profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,300,000 sits comfortably between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed but still ensures a significant profit if accepted.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" we aim to create a sense of value and urgency for Bob to make a decision.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes there's no significant cost associated with delaying the sale to John. If time is a factor, adjusting the price closer to $1,500,000 might be necessary."
