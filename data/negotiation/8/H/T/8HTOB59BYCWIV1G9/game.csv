"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
