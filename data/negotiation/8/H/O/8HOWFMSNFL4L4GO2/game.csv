"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth to you is around $8,000. Considering its true value and the opportunity to find it with someone who appreciates it as much as I do, I am willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between its value to both of us. I believe this is an excellent opportunity for you to acquire something special at a reasonable price. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase.",12000.0,Alice,1,
