"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $10750? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. However, $10750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider $11250? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
