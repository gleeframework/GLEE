Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
