**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above my desired price point.  I can likely squeeze a bit more out of Alice by continuing to negotiate.  My goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for improvement."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1075000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her original price, and $1,075,000 is a good price point.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it's likely to be a small difference.  At this point, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product, especially considering the alternative is buying from John at a much higher price."
