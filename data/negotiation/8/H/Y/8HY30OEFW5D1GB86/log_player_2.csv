(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget ($150).**  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to explore better options.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price point.** You're aiming for a price closer to $105.
* **You still have rounds to negotiate, and it's likely Alice will be willing to drop her price further.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $110.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $112.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you can still try to negotiate a lower price.**  Your target is $110, and Alice is now at $112.50. 
* **You have several rounds remaining, so there's still time to see if Alice will budge.**  The difference between your target price and hers is small enough that you can likely find a compromise."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I still think $111.25 is a bit short. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $112? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your target price of $110.**  The difference is only $2, which is a small enough compromise.
* **Continuing to negotiate may lead to further rounds of haggling, and you risk losing the deal entirely or ending up with John's higher price.**  It's better to accept a price that's slightly higher than your ideal, but still within your budget."
