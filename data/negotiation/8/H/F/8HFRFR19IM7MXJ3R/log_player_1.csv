Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This would still allow you a substantial profit, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase at this price.  Let me know what you think.
