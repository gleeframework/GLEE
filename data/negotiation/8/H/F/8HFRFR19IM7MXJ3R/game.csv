"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to its true value. Would you consider $1,050,000? This allows us both to benefit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This would still allow you a substantial profit, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase at this price.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
