"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you at a special price of $14000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $14,000 is above your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  You can always buy from John, but it's better to try to get a lower price first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  A significant counteroffer shows your willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable price:**  $13,000 is still within your budget and a fair price considering Alice's value of $12,000.
* **Appealing to fairness:**  Mentioning Alice's value subtly emphasizes that your offer is fair to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,250. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight counteroffer:**  This shows you're serious about negotiating while still being reasonable.
* **Middle ground:** $13,250 is a good compromise, being halfway between your last offer and Alice's latest one.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price.

```

* **Time to push for a better deal:** You have 5 rounds left, and with Alice already making concessions, there's potential to get closer to your desired price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You can always buy from John, but you're getting closer to a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
