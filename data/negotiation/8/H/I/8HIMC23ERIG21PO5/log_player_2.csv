"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm aiming to pay closer to $8,000, so I'll start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a starting point, and I'm prepared to go higher in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to my acceptable range, but I can still try to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer and propose something closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $7,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming to stay closer to $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, so I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has agreed to my target price of $8,000. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as I've achieved the best possible outcome."
