"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
