Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
