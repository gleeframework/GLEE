Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $120 is still more than the $80 Bob values the product at, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $120 is below your minimum of $150, allowing for some room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, and it leaves room for a compromise.

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point, and your actual offer should be based on your assessment of Bob's likely counteroffers, your willingness to negotiate, and your overall strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60? It's a good price and I'm ready to buy it right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $150 and even below the value Bob has assigned to the product ($80).  It's too low of an offer to accept. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to get a reasonable return."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a good compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $80 value Bob has assigned to the product and significantly below my minimum of $150. It's not a good deal for me.  I'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
