"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60? It's a good price and I'm ready to buy it right now.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to get a reasonable return.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a good compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",85.0,Alice,5,
