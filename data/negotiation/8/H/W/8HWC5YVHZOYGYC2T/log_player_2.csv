Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to get a reasonable return.

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd be willing to pay, it's not worth the continued back and forth. I can get the product for $80 from John, and at this point, saving those extra $5 is more valuable than the time and effort of further negotiation."
