"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,625.  This price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",10625.0,Bob,4,
