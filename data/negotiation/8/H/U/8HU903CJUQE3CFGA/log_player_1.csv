"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum value ($10,000). 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product without being pushy. 
* **Strategy:** I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he's not, I can move on to John without losing much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** $7,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **I have room to negotiate.** I'm still early in the process and can likely get a higher price. 
* **John is a backup.** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $8,500, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value and  significantly higher than his offer.
* **Message:**  I'm remaining polite and  highlighting the benefits of a deal for both parties.
* **Strategy:** By meeting Bob halfway, I show willingness to compromise and encourage him to counter with a higher offer. My fallback option with John gives me confidence in holding out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8000, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum.** $8,000 is just $2,000 below my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is taking time.** We're already halfway through the rounds.
* **John is a secure option.** If this deal falls through, I can still sell to John for $10,000.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise.  It ensures a sale and allows me to move on."
