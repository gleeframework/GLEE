"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has started at her absolute highest price. While it's possible she might not budge much, it makes no sense to accept her first offer when there's room for negotiation. I have nothing to lose by providing a counter-offer significantly lower than $1,200,000."

""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer  tests Alice's willingness to negotiate. It allows for room to move upwards while still staying well below John's backup price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a significant amount from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, she's claiming this is her lowest price. This could be true, but it's worth pushing back slightly to see if there's any more flexibility. A counter-offer between $900,000 and $1,050,000 keeps the negotiation moving."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. That discount is helpful, but I'm aiming for something closer to $975,000. Would that be workable?"",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:**  It acknowledges Alice's movement by moving upwards from the initial offer.
* **Stays Below John's Price:** It keeps the negotiation well below the $1,200,000 safety net, maximizing potential savings.
* **Tests Alice's ""Lowest Price"" Claim:** By not moving too close to $1,050,000, we see if she's truly at her limit or open to further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're getting close to my minimum price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could likely push Alice a tiny bit further, the potential savings are minimal at this point. Accepting her offer at $1,025,000 secures a significant discount ($175,000) compared to John's price.  Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Alice and forcing me to accept the backup option."
