"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it will be a great investment for you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  You are better off rejecting Alice's offer and securing the lower price."
