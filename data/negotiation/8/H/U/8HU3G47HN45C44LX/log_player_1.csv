Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $149 for it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down,  still landing you above your minimum. 
* **Avoid Appearing Too Greedy:**  Asking for the full $150 might make Bob feel like there's no room for discussion and discourage him from engaging.  

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
