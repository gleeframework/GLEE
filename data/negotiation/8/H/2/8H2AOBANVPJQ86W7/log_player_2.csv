{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is within his budget, it's likely he can get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if necessary. By offering $1,050,000, Bob is aiming to split the difference between his desired price and Alice's desired price, creating an initial point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $1,100,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still a bit high. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again trying to split the difference. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise, but still aiming for a lower price. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is now very close to Bob's desired price and is within his budget. There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate won't result in a significantly lower price, especially with only 5 rounds left. Accepting the offer secures the purchase and saves Bob money compared to buying from John."
