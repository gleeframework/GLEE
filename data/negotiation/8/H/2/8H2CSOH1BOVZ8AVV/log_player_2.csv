"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should counteroffer to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating to get a better price.  He can likely get closer to his desired price of $8,000 by making another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a little steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. He has already made two counteroffers and Alice is not willing to budge much further.  It's better to cut his losses and buy from John at a price that fits within his budget."
