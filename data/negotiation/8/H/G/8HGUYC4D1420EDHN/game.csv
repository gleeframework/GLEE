"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,000,000. However, I'm still a bit above the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I can meet you halfway, so I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a good deal. I can understand that $1,100,000 is a bit too high for you, and $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll come down to $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this amazing product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
