Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a favorable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The high price helps gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he negotiates, it shows he's interested but wants a better deal.  
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price for Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counter-offers remain too low, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John."
