,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,150,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,075,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. But I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,125,000? This is a fair price considering both our needs.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. It seems like we're getting closer. How about $1,100,000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,110,000. This is a compromise, but I can't go any lower than this. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1110000.0,Alice,7,
