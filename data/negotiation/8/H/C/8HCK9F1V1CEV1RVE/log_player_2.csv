Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,150,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. But I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,125,000? This is a fair price considering both our needs.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,110,000. This is a compromise, but I can't go any lower than this. Let's close this deal and make this happen.
