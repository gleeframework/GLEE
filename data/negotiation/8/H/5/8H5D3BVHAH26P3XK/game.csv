"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it at that price.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $145. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $130 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great deal for a product this valuable.  What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $135 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference one last time and go with $137.50.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $137.50. I'm willing to go up to $138, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",138.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're close to an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and accept $138.50 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. Let's close this deal!",138.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $138.50. I'm willing to make one final offer of $139, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",139.0,Bob,10,
