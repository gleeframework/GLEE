Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  While I know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, starting with a price slightly below that allows room for negotiation with Bob if needed. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth, potentially justifying the high price in his mind.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob's input and potential counter-offer, keeping the conversation open.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving a safety net (selling to John) if Bob rejects the initial offer."
