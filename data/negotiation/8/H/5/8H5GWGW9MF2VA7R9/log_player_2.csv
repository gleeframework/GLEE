"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than Alice's value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. He has the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for your product.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you say?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his $1,000,000 target. There are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,062,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to negotiate.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to his ideal price, he can still potentially get a better deal. He's only had 5 rounds, and there are still several left.  There's no need to rush into an agreement when he could potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,062,500 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,055,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 1055000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,055,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than previous offers, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  He has only had 7 rounds and has the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his ideal price or at least secure a deal that is closer to the price he could get from John.  He can also use the fact that he has the option of buying from John as leverage in his negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,060,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,055,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement this round. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1055000}
