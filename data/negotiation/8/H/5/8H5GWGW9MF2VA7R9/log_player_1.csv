"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for your product.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's close this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer again allows me to try and push for a higher price.  While selling to John is an option, I'd prefer to see if I can close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,062,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1062500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,062,500 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,055,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can finalize this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,055,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,055,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,055,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm also considering selling to John, but I'm not ready to give up on a deal with Bob yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,055,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,060,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,055,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement this round. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,055,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,055,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I need to make a decision. While I would like to close a deal with Bob,  we're at a standstill, and I'm running out of time.  The offer from John is more appealing as it's closer to my minimum price and guarantees a good deal.  I'll go with selling to John."
