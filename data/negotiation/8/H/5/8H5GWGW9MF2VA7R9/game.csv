"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for your product.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's close this now.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,062,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?",1062500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,062,500 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,055,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can finalize this now.",1055000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,055,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round.  Let me know what you think.",1060000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,060,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,055,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement this round. What do you say?",1055000.0,Bob,8,
