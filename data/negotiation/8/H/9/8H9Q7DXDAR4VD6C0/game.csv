"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $105. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
