"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset worth a lot to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth fairly. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. That's a good compromise, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
