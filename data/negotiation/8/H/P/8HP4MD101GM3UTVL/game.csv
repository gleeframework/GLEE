"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to make a fair profit, considering the product's worth to me is $1500000. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit lower on my budget than I expected. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're on a tighter budget than expected, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is the lowest I can go while still covering my costs.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for meeting me halfway, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's value to you. Considering the product's worth to me is $1500000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering $1050000 again, but this time, I'll throw in a small concession - I'll also cover 5% of the closing costs. This is my final offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one last offer to try to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $925000, but I need you to agree to a 3-year maintenance contract, which will be worth $50000 to me. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,9,
