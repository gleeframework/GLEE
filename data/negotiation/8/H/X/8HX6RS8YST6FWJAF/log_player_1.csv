"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target of $13,000 in the next round. There are still 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $12,000. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, I can get Bob to come up to a price that's more agreeable. There are still 5 rounds left and we're getting closer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal.  With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $11,500.  This is a smaller step than the previous rounds, and I believe it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up to a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining and Bob not budging significantly, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to come up to a price that works for me."
