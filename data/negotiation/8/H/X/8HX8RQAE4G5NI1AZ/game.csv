"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $10,000.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is as low as I can go, but I'm really hoping we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
