"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $170 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this.  $145 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not there. $145 is still a bit high for me. If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to go to $135.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
