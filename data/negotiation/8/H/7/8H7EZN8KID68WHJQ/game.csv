"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but the price point is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is still a great deal considering its worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but to make this work, I'd need to be at $1,175,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,175,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is still a great deal considering its worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
