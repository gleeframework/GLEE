"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We're aiming to get the price as close to $1,200,000 as possible. There's room for negotiation here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but the price point is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:** We start significantly lower than Alice's offer but still well above our walk-away point ($1,200,000 from John). 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This gives us space to gradually increase our offer if needed while aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.
* **Polite and professional:** We maintain a positive tone to encourage a collaborative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is still a great deal considering its worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to our acceptable price, but we're still $50,000 away from our ideal purchase from John. There's room for one more counteroffer to try and close that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but to make this work, I'd need to be at $1,175,000. Would that be agreeable to you?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** We're meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($1,250,000) and our previous offer ($1,100,000). 
* **Signaling seriousness:** This shows Alice we're serious about purchasing but need to stay within a reasonable budget. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  We're still below our walk-away price from John, giving us some negotiating power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,175,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is still a great deal considering its worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close enough:** Alice is now at $1,225,000. While not ideal, this is only slightly above our fallback option of buying from John for $1,200,000.
* **Alice is signaling her limit:** She's clearly indicated this is her final concession, making further negotiation unlikely. 
* **Minimal savings:** Pushing for the last $25,000 might jeopardize the deal entirely, and the potential savings are relatively small at this point. 

It's time to accept and secure the product."
