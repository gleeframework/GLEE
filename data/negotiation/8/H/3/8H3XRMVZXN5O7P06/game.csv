"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love this product. Let me know if you're interested!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $150 for it. It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can close the deal.  What do you say?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you at $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested!",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $165 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $150. I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",150.0,Bob,6,
