Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $140 represents a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but is still lower than your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, increasing the chances of a sale above his initial perceived value."
