# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, considering its value to you is $10000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
