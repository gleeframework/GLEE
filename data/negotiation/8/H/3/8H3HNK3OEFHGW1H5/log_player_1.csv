"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiasm:** The message is positive and highlights the value of the product.
* **Openness:**  The message invites Bob to respond and express his thoughts. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while starting with a price that is advantageous to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $110 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While John is a safe option, I'm not yet ready to give up on potentially earning more from Bob.

This decision allows me to explore further negotiation with Bob without immediately settling for a suboptimal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $110 to $95, but I'm still staying above my minimum of $100.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a search for a price that benefits both of us.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground with Bob while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with only John's $100 offer. 

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal and settling for a lower price."
