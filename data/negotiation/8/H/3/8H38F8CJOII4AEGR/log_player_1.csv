Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that.

While a higher price is ideal, we're getting close to diminishing returns. Bob is unlikely to budge much from his ""final offer.""  Accepting $1,220,000 secures a significant profit over John's standing offer."
