Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I can likely get a better price from him, and I'm still within the 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low.  The product is worth a significant amount, and I'm confident its value will exceed your initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, how about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to earn more,  $10,250 is a good offer, considering the value of the product to me ($10,000) and the fact that I can always sell to John for that amount. I'm also nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
