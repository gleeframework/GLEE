"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the market value.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low.  The product is worth a significant amount, and I'm confident its value will exceed your initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, how about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",10250.0,Bob,4,
