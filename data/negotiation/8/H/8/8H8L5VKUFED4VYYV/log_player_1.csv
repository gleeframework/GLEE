Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very fair price. Would you be interested in hearing more about it? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, there's no point in asking for more. My goal is to secure the sale and maximize my profit. If Bob declines, I have a guaranteed buyer in John. This approach ensures a successful transaction."
