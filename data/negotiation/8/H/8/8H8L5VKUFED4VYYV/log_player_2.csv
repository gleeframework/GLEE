"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very fair price. Would you be interested in hearing more about it?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is offering the product at her own valuation, leaving no room for you to save money. You can get the same product for the same price from John, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
