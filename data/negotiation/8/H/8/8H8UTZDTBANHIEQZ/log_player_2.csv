"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000. I believe it's a valuable asset that can greatly benefit your business, and this price reflects its potential. Of course, I understand this is a significant investment, so feel free to ask any questions you may have. If you're not interested, no worries, I have another buyer lined up at $800,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $800,000 and Alice is asking for $850,000, it's better to reject her offer. You can get the product from John for your budget."
