"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more, as the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than what he's willing to pay.  I'm hoping to meet him halfway and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,750 is a decent compromise. It's higher than John's offer and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to close the deal."
