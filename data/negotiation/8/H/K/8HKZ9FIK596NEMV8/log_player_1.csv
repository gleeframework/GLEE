Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it would bring immense value to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **Bob:** Gets a $150,000 discount from the product's worth to him ($1,000,000 vs. $1,150,000).
    * **Alice:** Earns an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, further maximizing your profit."
