Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for compromise. 
* **Acknowledging Value:**  The message highlights the ""value and potential"" to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""starting price,"" Alice signals that she's open to discussion and potential adjustments. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing she has a guaranteed offer from John gives Alice a strong position and allows her to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than both Alice's desired price and John's standing offer. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Alice to counter with a price closer to her target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however,  the value this product brings is truly exceptional, and $950,000 falls quite short of that.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Compromise:** Alice acknowledges Bob's counteroffer but reiterates the product's high value. By decreasing her price to $1,050,000, she demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($950,000) and Alice's previous price ($1,100,000), aiming for a mutually agreeable point.
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John's offer in her back pocket gives Alice the confidence to stand firm and not drastically lower her price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I still think $950,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I have a limit to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is only $75,000 less than Alice's desired minimum of $1,100,000. It's a strong offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away or getting stuck at a lower price. Accepting now secures a very good deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal quickly avoids potential delays and allows Alice to reinvest the capital sooner.

While selling to John would net Alice the full $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer at $1,025,000 represents a favorable compromise, minimizes risk, and provides a substantial profit."
