The goal is to maximize profit, and while $12,800 is better than $10,000, it's still lower than the previous offer. There's a chance Bob might increase his offer again, so it's worth exploring that possibility."

Round 10
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is below your minimum acceptable price and you're in the last round. You can either accept and sell the product for $12,000 or sell to John for $10,000. Although $12,000 is more than $10,000, it's still not meeting your minimum requirement.  Therefore, selling to John for $10,000 is the best option, as it guarantees a higher profit than selling to Bob at $12,000."
