"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I think it could really benefit you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,500 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's try this: $8,500, and I'll throw in [mention a small but valuable add-on related to the product]. That's a significant compromise on my end and adds value for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the add-on, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,875? I'm willing to consider the add-on, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal on the product itself.",7875.0,Bob,6,
