{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a great deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll gain. This encourages him to consider my offer seriously. 
* **John's offer as backup:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to move on to John and secure my minimum desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a high value. However, considering my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's constraints while highlighting the benefits of a middle ground for both of us. This emphasizes fairness and encourages him to consider my counteroffer.
* **John's offer as backup:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, and if Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer and secure my minimum desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $960000. This offers a compromise between our positions and adheres closely to my budget constraints. I hope this suggestion is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob is offering $960,000, which is very close to my previous counteroffer of $975,000. 
* **Negotiation progress:**  We've had a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're getting closer to a deal. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Although I can still try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and I'll end up selling to John for less than I initially hoped. 
* **Accepting the offer:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, even if it's slightly lower than my ideal price. It minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
