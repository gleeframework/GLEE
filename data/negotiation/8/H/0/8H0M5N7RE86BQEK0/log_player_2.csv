Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $13,000? That's a small increase from my last offer and would be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her $13,000 offer. You've held firm at $12,500, and she's showing resistance.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, saving you $3,000.  There's no point in risking a worse deal with Alice when you have a guaranteed good option with John."
