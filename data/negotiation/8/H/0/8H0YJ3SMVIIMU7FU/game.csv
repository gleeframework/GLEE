"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you thinking of me, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $100 for the product.  This is my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
