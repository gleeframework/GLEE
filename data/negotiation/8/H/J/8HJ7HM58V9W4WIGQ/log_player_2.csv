{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to negotiate, and Alice's offer is still above his target. He's already made several counteroffers, and there's a risk that Alice won't budge further. Since he has the option to buy from John for a lower price, it's the most logical choice. 

By buying from John, Bob ensures he gets the product within his budget, even if it means missing out on a potentially slightly better deal with Alice."
