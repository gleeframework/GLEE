Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum threshold of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I want to maximize my profit, but also want to ensure a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is still above my minimum threshold of $80. It's not a great deal, but it's better than selling to John for $80 or risking a prolonged negotiation that could ultimately lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
