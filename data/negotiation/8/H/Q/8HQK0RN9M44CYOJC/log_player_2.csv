"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, you can still try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $95, and it's still above the $80 value Alice places on the product. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially save a significant amount of money."
