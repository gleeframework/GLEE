{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than your minimum, giving you some room to negotiate down.  The message is friendly and sets a positive tone, aiming to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe I can find something similar at a lower price. Can we negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to get a higher price. You can try to negotiate a bit more before accepting his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price just yet.  Considering the value and quality of this product, I can come down to $125. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a fair compromise. Would you be open to discussing the possibility of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is significantly closer to your desired price point than John's offer of $100, making it the more lucrative option at this stage. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure a better price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
