Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob. This gives me bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, which gives me the confidence to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $10,500 is my absolute bottom line. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price to $10,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's profitable for me.
* **Clear bottom line:** I'm stating my ""bottom line"" clearly to avoid endless back-and-forth.
* **Maintain positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,800 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to be successful:**  Bob's offer is close to his initial offer, indicating he's unlikely to budge much further.  
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take time, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  It's more efficient to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
