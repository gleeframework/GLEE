Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial.  I'm asking for $1,450,000,  which reflects its true worth and the value it will bring to your business.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. While Bob might try to negotiate down, it establishes a high perceived value. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""true worth"" and ""value"" aims to shift Bob's focus from just the price to the potential benefits he's getting.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster and avoid losing out.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while still leaving room for him to feel like he's getting a ""deal."" If he rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed backup to ensure you get your minimum price."
