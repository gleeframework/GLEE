"Alice, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand you value this product, but I'm only comfortable going up to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true worth of this product.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that respects both our positions.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
