"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. While $1200000 is closer to what I can afford, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable while still being within my financial limits.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1100000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I understand the importance of reaching an agreement, and I'm willing to make a final offer. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable and allow us to move forward with the transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I've already made some significant concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. However, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1250000, but I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. I'm including a premium support package and a 10% discount on the total price. This is my final offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your efforts, Alice. I appreciate the additional perks you've offered, but they do not significantly alter the overall cost. Given my budget constraints, I'm unable to accept $1250000 for the product. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1225000. This includes a slight reduction in price, which I hope will be more in line with your expectations.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, and I'll throw in an additional 5% discount on the total price. This is my final offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1175000. I hope this aligns more closely with your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,10,
