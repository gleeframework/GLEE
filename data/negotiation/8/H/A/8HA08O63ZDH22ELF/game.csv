"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
