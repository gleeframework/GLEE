"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit more manageable.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer, it's still not quite in line with the true value of this product. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
