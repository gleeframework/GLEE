"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price, especially since we have the backup option of John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation. By starting lower, we might be able to secure a much better deal than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our backup price with John. Let's see if we can push her a bit further."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit more manageable.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $775,000?"",
""product_price"": 775000
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our previous counteroffer. This shows we're willing to negotiate, but also holds a firm position below our John fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer, it's still not quite in line with the true value of this product. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're now close enough to John's price that it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees we stay within our budget."
