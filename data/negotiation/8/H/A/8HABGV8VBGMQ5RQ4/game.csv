"Alice, your product is definitely attractive, but  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find common ground. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects the value I place on the transaction and allows us to move forward together.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000 for the product. This offer is a significant compromise and represents the maximum I can reasonably pay at this time.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
