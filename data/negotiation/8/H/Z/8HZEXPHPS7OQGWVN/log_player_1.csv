Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the worth of the product to both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially negotiate a deal closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
