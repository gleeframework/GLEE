Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is getting down to the wire, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,062,500? It's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000 and we have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a low chance of reward and a high chance of costing us money."
