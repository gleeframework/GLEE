"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a fantastic price considering the product's value to you. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $950,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let's make a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand this is getting down to the wire, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,062,500? It's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",1062500.0,Alice,7,
