"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at face value. You know John is willing to sell for the same price.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 12.5% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and gives her room to counter without feeling like she's giving too much away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my offer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter again to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my offer slightly to $725,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise while still keeping the pressure on for a good deal.  I'm hoping she'll accept, but if not, we're still closer to a final price than in the previous rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While I'd love to get it lower, accepting at $735,000 saves me $65,000 compared to John's price, and we're only five rounds into the negotiation. There's a good chance I'll be able to get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering again, but the risk of losing out on a decent deal is high. It's time to secure a win."
