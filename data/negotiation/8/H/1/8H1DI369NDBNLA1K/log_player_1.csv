"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I need to get, hoping to leave room for negotiation and secure a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging to build rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to justify the price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response. If he rejects, I'll either counteroffer or consider selling to John depending on how determined Bob seems to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can push for a higher price.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** By rejecting this offer, I can gauge how determined Bob is to buy the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price somewhere between Bob's offer and my initial offer. I'll carefully consider Bob's response before making a counteroffer.
* **Monitoring John:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, recognizing your interest in the product. This offer reflects the value I know it holds for you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob to justify the price. 
* **Building Towards Agreement:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to continue negotiations and hopefully reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I may either reduce my offer further or consider selling to John if I feel the negotiation is going nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am still only able to pay up to $975,000. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm hesitant to accept a price that leaves me with such a low profit margin.
* **Remaining Negotiating Room:**  I believe there's still some room for negotiation, particularly since Bob seems determined to make this deal. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting this offer, I can potentially push Bob to make a final, higher offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired target. I'll keep in mind the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John as a backup plan. 
* **Assessing Bob's Determination:** I'll be watching for signs of how strongly Bob wants the product to gauge how much further I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using language that suggests a sense of finality, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Close Observation:** I'll be closely watching Bob's response to see if he accepts the offer. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or consider selling to John.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm mindful of the limited rounds remaining and will adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $960,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value you place on it while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost There, But Still Not Enough:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hesitant to accept it. The profit margin is very slim, and I'd prefer to push for a little more.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I can gauge how seriously Bob wants the product. If he's willing to increase his offer, I'll know I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Limited Rounds:** I'm aware of the limited rounds remaining and will factor that into my decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer. I'll emphasize the value the product brings to Bob and the importance of reaching an agreement.
* **Selling to John:**  If Bob continues to refuse my offers, I'll strongly consider selling to John to ensure I get a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling optimistic about reaching a deal. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $980,000 for the product. It's a fair price that considers both of our interests and allows us to move forward.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm offering a price that's very close to Bob's last offer, but still slightly higher. It's a final push to see if I can get a slightly better deal.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive and encouraging language to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm acknowledging the limited rounds remaining and emphasizing the need for a quick decision.

**Next Steps:**

* **Decision Point:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John to ensure I get a reasonable price.  The profit margin is already thin, and with only three rounds left, I need to make a decision that secures a good outcome.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option and be prepared to move forward with him if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $970,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** With only two rounds left, the time pressure is significant. There's a high risk that Bob might continue to lower his offer, potentially pushing me further below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Small Profit Margin:**  Bob's offer is only $10,000 higher than my minimum, which is a very small profit margin.  The risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is too high at this point.
* **Secure Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is a much more secure and reliable outcome considering the limited time and the potential for further negotiation failures. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Closing the Deal with John:** I will contact John and finalize the sale to ensure I secure the $1,000,000 profit.
* **Potential Future Negotiations:** While I've decided to sell to John this time, I'll keep Bob in mind for potential future negotiations if a similar product or opportunity arises."
