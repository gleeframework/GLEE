Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $130, which is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to make Bob feel comfortable and potentially more inclined to negotiate.
* **Opportunity for John:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John open, ensuring I have a fallback if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure $150 by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $120? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, reminding Bob of the value of the product and highlighting the ""great deal"" he'd be getting.
* **Avoiding John:** I'm not rushing to sell to John yet, as I'm hopeful this counteroffer will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $110 as a compromise. This still allows me to stay within my budget while giving you a fair price for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $110 is only $40 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer of $100. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price. It's unclear how much more Bob is willing to offer.
* **Secure sale:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and eliminates the risk of Bob backing out completely.
* **John is still an option:** I can still sell to John for $150 if this deal falls through."
