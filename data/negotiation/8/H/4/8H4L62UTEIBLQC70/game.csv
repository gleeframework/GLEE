"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and your valuation of it.",10250.0,Alice,5,
