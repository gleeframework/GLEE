"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $100 is a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $85? I'm really interested in the product and think we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $88 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from another seller.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $95. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering selling it to another buyer who is willing to pay the full price of $120.",95.0,Alice,5,
