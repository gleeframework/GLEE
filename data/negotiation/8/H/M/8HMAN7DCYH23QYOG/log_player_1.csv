Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential ROI for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High, but Reasonable:** I began with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Highlight Value:**  By emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" and potential ""ROI,"" I'm framing the offer in a way that resonates with Bob's potential benefits, potentially justifying the high price in his mind. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, indicating my willingness to negotiate to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the potential ROI and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still a significant way off from my minimum acceptable price.  I know John is ready to pay $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation with Bob, and I want to explore that before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of this product."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm reducing my price by $50,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Hold Firm (for now):** The new price is still closer to my initial offer, showing I'm not willing to drastically drop my price. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the higher price point and potentially sway Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, and I hope we can meet in the middle. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made two consecutive offers significantly below my minimum price. His latest offer of $900,000 is still $300,000 less than what John is offering. While I could continue negotiating, the gap seems too large to bridge quickly. To ensure I get a fair price for the product and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations, it's in my best interest to sell to John now."
