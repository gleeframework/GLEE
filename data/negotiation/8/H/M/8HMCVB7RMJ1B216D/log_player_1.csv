Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring you still profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It gets straight to the point without any unnecessary fluff.

I'll be ready to respond to any counteroffers from Bob or to move on to John if the negotiation stalls."
