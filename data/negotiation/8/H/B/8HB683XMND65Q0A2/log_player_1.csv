Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $120. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I can still try to get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a good deal and I'm getting closer to my desired price.  While I could try to get more, I risk losing the sale altogether and having to settle for John's offer of $120."
