"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly exceptional. Would you like to purchase it from me for $20000?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000?  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, $11000 is still below my minimum target. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is a significant concession from my original offer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500.  To make this work, I need to stay under $12000.  Let's try $11500.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and allows us to close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value is worth it.",13250.0,Alice,7,
