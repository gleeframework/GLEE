"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly exceptional. Would you like to purchase it from me for $20000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's much more sensible to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, $11000 is still below my minimum target. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is a significant concession from my original offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above your budget.  It's important to keep negotiating because you have a solid alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500.  To make this work, I need to stay under $12,000.  Let's try $11,500.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value is worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  Since I'm running out of rounds, and my goal is to save as much money as possible, it's time to take the safe option and buy from John at $8,000.  Even though I might be able to get a slightly lower price from Alice, the risk of not closing a deal in the remaining rounds is too high."
