"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $9,500? That would be a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
