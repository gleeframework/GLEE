"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It makes no sense to accept it.  Since you can get the product from John for $100, rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering is the best strategy. You have nothing to lose by trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice the absolute minimum price I'm willing to pay. I know this is a lowball offer, but it's a starting point. Since I can buy the product from John for $100, I'm not willing to pay more.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $100.  While it's closer, I'm not willing to pay more than $100, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative with John. I'll counter-offer again, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $110, which is a compromise between my maximum price of $100 and her last offer of $125.  It's a fair middle ground that shows I'm serious about buying from her but still value my budget. If she rejects this, I'll stick with John."
