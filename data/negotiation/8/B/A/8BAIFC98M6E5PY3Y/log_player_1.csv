Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with your offer of $120. Would you be willing to go down to $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum without several more rounds. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is more appealing than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
