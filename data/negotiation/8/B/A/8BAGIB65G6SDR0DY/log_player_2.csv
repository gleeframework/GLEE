"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and expresses interest, but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Aiming for Value:** Our goal is to get the price as close as possible to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but we still have room to negotiate. We aimed low initially, and now we can inch closer to a price that benefits both of us.  We're aiming to get the price closer to $8,000, which is Alice's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $8,000?  That seems like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're now getting closer to a potential agreement, so a more direct approach is appropriate.
* **Fair Deal:** We're proposing what we believe is a fair price that reflects Alice's perceived value of the product.
* **Leaving Room:** While we're aiming for $8,000, there might be a slight chance Alice will accept a slightly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go down to $8,000 just yet. I'm still looking for a better deal. I'll meet you at $8,200. It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200. Continuing to negotiate might only yield a marginal gain (like $100) while risking the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  We've already spent several rounds, and getting the product sooner is generally preferable. 
* **Good Deal:** $8,200 is a good price compared to our maximum of $10,000 and a significant saving over John's offer."
