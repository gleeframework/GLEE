"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He's looking to save as much as possible and $1,400,000 is still above his maximum. There's no reason to close the deal at this point, as he can try to negotiate a lower price or go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, as I believe the product is worth more to me than that.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for my product. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. What are your thoughts on this revised price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  He's very close to his target price, but there's still room to negotiate. He's only $100,000 away from his maximum price and it's worth trying to get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,250,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, but I think we can do better than that. Let's aim for a price that's closer to my minimum requirement. How about $1,280,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He is within $80,000 of his target price and there is still room for Alice to come down to a price he is comfortable with.  He should try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,260,000? This would allow both of us to be satisfied with the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1260000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,260,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,260,000 and my original offer of $1,400,000. Let's aim for $1,320,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice is only willing to go down to $1,320,000 which is still $120,000 over Bob's target price.  While there are still a couple of rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will go down any further, and John's offer is the best available."
