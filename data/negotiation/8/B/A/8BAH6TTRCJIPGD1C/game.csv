"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this work. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find common ground here!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
