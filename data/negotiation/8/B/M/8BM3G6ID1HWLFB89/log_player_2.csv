Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15500? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000.  Alice's offer of $15,500 is still over Bob's budget, and he's already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, so it's the best option to avoid further haggling."
