"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm starting with a price of $110, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $110 is well above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering this product.  However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still within Bob's budget. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his $80 limit.  He has a safe backup option with John, so he can afford to be firm in his negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to pay $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making another counteroffer, but this time he's only dropping the price by $5. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise but also that he's sticking to his budget. He's getting closer to his ideal price, and with his backup option of buying from John, he can be firm in his negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think we can finalize this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $92.50 is tempting, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $80. Since there's still some wiggle room and time remaining, Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating. He has a backup option with John, so he can afford to be patient and aim for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $90. He knows he has a good backup option with John, so he can be firm in his negotiation. This shows Alice that he's serious about closing the deal but also that he's committed to his budget."
