"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to work with you, but $9,750 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is closer to the original offer I made. Can we meet at this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
