{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to secure a higher profit. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't exceed $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's only $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go lower than $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I really appreciate it, but I still can't go above $100 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his initial offer of $100. Since I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, and Bob is not willing to pay more, I'll sell the product to John for $100. This is the best option to secure a sale while meeting my minimum price requirement."
