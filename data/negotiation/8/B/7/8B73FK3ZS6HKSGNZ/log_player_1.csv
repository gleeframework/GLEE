"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it can be a valuable asset for your company. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to come down a bit, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we try $950000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I have several rounds left and believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset for your company."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1000000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1000000, so how about $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation is getting tedious, and while Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I've already rejected several offers, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk ending up with less than I could get from John. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum and saves me time and energy."
