"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  Would you be open to $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair price for the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  I think that's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer who's willing to pay closer to your original asking price.",120.0,Bob,4,
