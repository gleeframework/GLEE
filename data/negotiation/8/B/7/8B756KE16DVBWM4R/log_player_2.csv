Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $100 is a great offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I can sell it to you for $115. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems firm on not going below $110. Accepting the $115 offer gets me the product at a price significantly better than John's $150."
