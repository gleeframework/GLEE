"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable and worth a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. It's also a price that might be more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for potential future adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to increase his bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a good profit margin for me. I'm hoping that this shows him my willingness to negotiate and encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price to avoid further negotiations, but not as low as Bob's offer. Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees a safe and reasonable profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on a certain deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
