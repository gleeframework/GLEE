Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving you a baseline.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,450,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle above your minimum price.
* **Backup Offer:** The guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have limited time or prefer a quicker sale. If you had more time and no other offers, you could potentially hold out for a higher price from Bob."
