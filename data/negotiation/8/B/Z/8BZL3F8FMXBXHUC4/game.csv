"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. This is my absolute maximum budget, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,000 is getting close, but I'm still a bit off. I'm offering $9,750. This is a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,8,
