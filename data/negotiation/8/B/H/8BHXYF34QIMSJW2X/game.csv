,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'll counter with $1100000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $950000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I need a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's get this deal done!",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a final compromise of $975000. This is my best price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,7,
