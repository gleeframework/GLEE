"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening with a high price:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob, aiming to get a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm being polite and friendly to build rapport and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm mentioning the product's uniqueness and value to entice Bob.

**Important:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.  This gives me a safety net and makes me less inclined to accept low offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is still a decent profit, I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer in the second round. Bob's counteroffer is too far below my initial price and shows a lack of serious intent to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, and I believe I have enough rounds to reach a more favorable deal.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'll counter with $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising but firm:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not significantly. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a good price.
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my price is justified.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm using phrases like ""work together"" and ""fair deal"" to maintain a positive and constructive atmosphere. 

**Important:** I'm not going to give up easily. This is a reasonable counteroffer that still leaves me in a good position. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Getting closer:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price. However, I'm still not ready to accept it.
* **Time is on my side:**  We are still early in the negotiation process.  I have several more rounds to make a better deal.
* **Seeking a higher price:** I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate. 

**Important:** While $950,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle just yet. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, and I have enough rounds to see if Bob is truly serious about getting the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I need a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate compromise:** I'm lowering my price again, showing I'm flexible and willing to find a solution. However, I'm still maintaining a price point above the $1,000,000 mark.
* **Emphasizing value and fairness:** I reiterate the product's worth and emphasize that my offer is ""fair"" for both parties. This encourages Bob to see my offer as a reasonable compromise.
* **Creating urgency:** I use the phrase ""Let's get this deal done!"" to subtly push Bob towards an agreement and avoid further rounds of negotiation. 

**Important:** This counteroffer allows me to explore a price closer to my desired outcome while still leaving some room for negotiation in the remaining rounds. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $900000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I'm getting close to my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still pushing for a better deal:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to $1,000,000, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I have several rounds remaining, so there's no pressure to accept a lower offer at this stage. 
* **Confidence in negotiation:** I'm confident I can convince Bob to go higher or I can simply sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Important:**  I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly less than what John is willing to pay.  This is my chance to get closer to my ideal selling price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a final compromise of $975,000. This is my best price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** This counteroffer shows a genuine attempt to reach a deal. I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to find common ground.
* **Highlighting value and deal:** I remind Bob of the product's value and how this price is a good deal for him. This emphasizes the win-win aspect.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm framing this as a ""final compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation. 

**Important:** 
*  While $975,000 is below my initial target, it's still a good profit. I'm aiming for a deal that's reasonable for both of us.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $925000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I'm not willing to go much lower than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, but it's still not enough. We've been negotiating for several rounds, and there's a risk of further back and forth without reaching a deal.
* **Time is running out:**  We only have two rounds left. There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a much safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially with limited rounds remaining.

**Important:** 
* It's crucial to evaluate the risk-reward. The potential gain of squeezing a few more thousand dollars from Bob is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* Selling to John ensures a quick and secure transaction that meets my minimum price point."
