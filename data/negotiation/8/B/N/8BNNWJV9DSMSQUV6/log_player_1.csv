Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $125 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a reasonable deal.  If he rejects, we can adjust the price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? It's still a great deal for a product worth so much to you!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $105 is very close to our minimum price and getting any higher is unlikely. Accepting his offer is the best option to ensure a sale and maximize our profits."
