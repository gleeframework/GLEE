"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you, and I get a fair price for something I value highly. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this deal worthwhile. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. That's the lowest I can go.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  But $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go up to $1,125,000. I'm still thinking $1,075,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1,100,000. That's my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
