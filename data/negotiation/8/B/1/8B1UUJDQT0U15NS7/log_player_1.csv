"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you, and I get a fair price for something I value highly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need to make. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this deal worthwhile. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I still think I can push for a bit higher. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  But $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $1,125,000. I'm still thinking $1,075,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1,100,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with with Bob, I've reached a point where I don't think I can get a much better offer from him. I've also only got 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John will give me the best possible outcome for the product."
