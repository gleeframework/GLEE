The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $87? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87

Alice's offer of $87 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than the price from John, and it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting is the best option to save money."
