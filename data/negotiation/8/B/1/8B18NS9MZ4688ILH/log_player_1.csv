I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I'm aiming for the best possible price while keeping in mind that John is a backup option at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more."

Bob is not budging. He's only willing to pay my minimum price, and I've already gone down to $1,750,000.  To avoid further negotiation and uncertainty, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a guaranteed outcome and meets my minimum requirement."
