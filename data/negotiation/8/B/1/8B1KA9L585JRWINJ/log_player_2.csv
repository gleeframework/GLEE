"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a bit less.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though Alice is asking $90, it's still less than the $100 John is charging.
* **You want to save money.**  You're aiming to get the product for the lowest price possible.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $10 compared to buying from John."
