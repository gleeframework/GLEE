Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  I'll be ready to counter if necessary, but I'm hoping this initial offer will pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and it's likely he won't go higher.  It's better to secure a sale for $90 than risk further negotiation and potentially only getting $80 from John."
