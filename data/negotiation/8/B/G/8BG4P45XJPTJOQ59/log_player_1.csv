Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know Bob values the product at ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer of $90 still gives me a profit margin while allowing space for Bob to negotiate if he wants. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:**  While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have the advantage of being able to sell to John for $100, which gives me more leverage in this negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer:** I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $85 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  How about $88?  It's a fair price that gives you a great deal and allows me to make a profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm sticking to a strategy of counter-offers to try and slowly close the gap towards my desired price. 
* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $88 is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** I'm using an upbeat and positive tone to encourage Bob to agree to the offer. 
* **John Factor:** I'm keeping in mind the backup option of selling to John for $100, which strengthens my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $88 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $86? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $86 is very close to my desired price and represents a significant compromise on his part.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and I'll be left with the option of selling to John for $100.  Accepting this offer is a good way to secure a profit while minimizing risk.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process, and I'm not sure if Bob is willing to go any higher.  It's better to take a good deal now rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
