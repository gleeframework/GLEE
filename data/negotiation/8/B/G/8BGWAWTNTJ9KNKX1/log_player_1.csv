Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum and his stated value. It's clear there's room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tempting offer from Bob, and it's above my minimum. However, there's still potential to earn more.  I'll counter slightly below his stated value to test his willingness to move.

Round 6
