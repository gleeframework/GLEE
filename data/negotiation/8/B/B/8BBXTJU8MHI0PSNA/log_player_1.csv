Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a better deal. 
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than his perceived value increases the likelihood of Bob accepting immediately.

This strategy aims to secure a higher profit than your guaranteed sale to John while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
