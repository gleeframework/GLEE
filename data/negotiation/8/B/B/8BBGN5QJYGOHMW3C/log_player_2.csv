"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling the product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is offering a price lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject her offer and go with John, who's selling it at your desired price."
