"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  That's a fair offer considering the quality of the product.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm willing to stand by it. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
