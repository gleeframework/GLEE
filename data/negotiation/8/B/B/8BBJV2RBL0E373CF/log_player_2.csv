"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price by negotiating further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can likely negotiate further, the current offer is a good deal. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $13,750.  This is a savings of $1,250, which is a good compromise.  If he rejects this offer, there is no guarantee he'll get a better deal, and he could end up paying more to John."
