``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value Bob will get by acquiring the product, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to get it a bit lower.  How about $13,500?  I'm serious about buying, but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I can still do better. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 13750}
