Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know you'll recognize its immense value.  I'm willing to make this transaction smooth and straightforward for you with a price of $1,850,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer significantly exceeds Bob's perceived value. However, it allows you to gauge his interest and potential for negotiation.  
* **Anchoring:**  Starting with a high number can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially leading to a higher final price even after negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), you might adjust your approach.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a less aggressive starting price."
