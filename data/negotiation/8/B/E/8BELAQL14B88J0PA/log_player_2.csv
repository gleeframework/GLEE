"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price that's fair for both of us. It's a valuable piece and I know you'll appreciate it.  Let's settle on a price of $12,000.  This gives you a great deal, and it's more than I'd get from another buyer.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, Alice's message hints that she might be willing to go lower. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation and the potential to get a better price."
