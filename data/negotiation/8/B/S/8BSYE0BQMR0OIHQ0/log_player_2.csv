I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $775,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait. Alice is very unlikely to go below $775,000 and it's not worth risking losing the $800,000 deal with John."
