"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a fair compromise given the value we both see in this product.  Let's get this deal done.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $12,500 to close this deal quickly. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but $12,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be firm.  I can't go any lower than $12,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the product's value.  What do you say, shall we wrap this up?",12000.0,Alice,7,
