Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it presents a great value at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $10,000 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal (compared to a potential higher starting price) while maximizing Alice's potential profit."
