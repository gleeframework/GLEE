# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is a fair middle ground, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this will close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is still a compromise on my part. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
