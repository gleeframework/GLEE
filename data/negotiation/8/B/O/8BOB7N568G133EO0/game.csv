"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90 for the product, which is closer to my budget and a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to pay $90. However, I'm not willing to go below $100, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, so I'm offering it to you for $95. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
