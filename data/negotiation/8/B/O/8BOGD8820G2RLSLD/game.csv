"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This would still leave you with a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, $1,025,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. I believe we're very close to an agreement, and I hope you'll consider my offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
