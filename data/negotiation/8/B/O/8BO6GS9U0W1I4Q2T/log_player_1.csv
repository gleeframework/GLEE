Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it's a great deal considering its value."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling around a price that's still very profitable for me. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to my minimum ($80) increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and me having to settle for the guaranteed $80 from John.

This strategy aims to secure a significantly higher profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
