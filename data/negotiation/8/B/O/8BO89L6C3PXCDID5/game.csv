"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the product and your offer, but I can only afford to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you be willing to accommodate my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I value your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. To make this work, I would need to come down to $10,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still unable to meet the price of $10,000. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your financial limitations. I'm hoping we can find common ground here. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,
