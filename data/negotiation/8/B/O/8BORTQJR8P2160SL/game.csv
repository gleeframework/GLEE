"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe its worth is significantly higher than the price I'm offering. Let's start with $1500000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1500000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is a fair price considering my research. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's compromise at $1200000.  This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. Given my research and the product's potential, I'm prepared to offer $950000. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950000 is still below my desired price point.  Let's meet in the middle at $1075000.  This offer reflects the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1075000 is still outside my budget. To move forward, I can offer $1000000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and reflects the value we both see in this product. If this price isn't acceptable, I may need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $1000000 still falls short of what this product is worth.  However, to demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1100000.  This is a fair price for both of us and reflects the value of this unique opportunity.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the progress we've made, I'm willing to offer $1050000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest in this product.  This price is fair and reflects the value we both see in it. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1050000 is still below the value of this product. Given that we're in the final stages of negotiation, I'm willing to compromise further. My final offer is $1075000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value of this unique product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
