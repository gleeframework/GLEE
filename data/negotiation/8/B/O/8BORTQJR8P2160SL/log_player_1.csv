Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1500000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is a fair price considering my research. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. Given my research and the product's potential, I'm prepared to offer $950000. This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1075000 is still outside my budget. To move forward, I can offer $1000000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and reflects the value we both see in this product. If this price isn't acceptable, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
