"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the potential benefit to Bob. It also opens the door for discussion.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I aim to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  The message sets a collaborative tone and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet. Bob's offer demonstrates that he's willing to negotiate, and there's still room to move closer to my desired price point. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price. This will give me a better chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This still gives you a great value, and it's a price I can live with.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's significantly closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the mutual benefit of closing the deal. It also reiterates my willingness to be flexible.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's price, I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate seriously.  This also keeps the deal moving forward and prevents me from having to consider selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:**  This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I'll be forced to sell to John at a lower price.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer as a compromise.  It's a fair price considering the time we have left in the negotiation. By accepting, I secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially ending in a less favorable outcome."
