"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in buying it, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To better align with your current offer, I am willing to negotiate. My counteroffer is $150 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the item while accommodating your financial situation. Please let me know if this works for you.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $150 is getting closer, it's still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, as I'm already pushing my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of your latest offer, I am pleased to counter with $125 for the product. This price reflects the value of the item while considering your budgetary constraints. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $125 is very close to what I'm able to spend.  However, I'm still hoping we can close the deal at my final offer of $120.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the sale.",120.0,Bob,6,
