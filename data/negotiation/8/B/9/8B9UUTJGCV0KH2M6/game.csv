Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. It's a great price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your life.,14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. It's still a great deal considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $10500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm thinking of a price of $11200. It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,
