"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. It's a great price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. It's still a great deal considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above Bob's preferred price of $10,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice. John is a guaranteed option, but he may be able to get a better deal if he keeps negotiating with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm thinking of a price of $11200. It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product. While Alice has come down from her initial price, $11,200 is still above his budget. John is offering the product for a price that is within Bob's budget. Therefore, the most rational decision for Bob is to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
