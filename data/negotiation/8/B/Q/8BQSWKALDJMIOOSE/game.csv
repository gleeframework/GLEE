,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to pay $105, as that's the maximum I can afford right now.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 130? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great value from the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $115. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 115 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 125? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
