"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,000,000 is my final offer.  It's still a significant savings for you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, $950,000 is still too far off from my ideal price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer you the product for $950,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
