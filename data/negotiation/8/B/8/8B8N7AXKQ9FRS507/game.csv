,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $90?  That's still a good deal for a product like this.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me. $90 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. How about we split the difference and go with $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. Let's meet in the middle at $88. This is a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Alice,5,
