"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is his maximum price, he wants to see if he can get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Reasonable offer:** $80 is a reasonable starting point,  leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** Bob maintains a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $90?  That's still a good deal for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $90 is closer to Bob's limit, there's still room to potentially get a better price. 
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a lower price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting, Bob keeps the option of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me. $90 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. How about we split the difference and go with $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is showing willingness to meet halfway, demonstrating good faith and encouraging Alice to compromise further.
* **Reasonable offer:** $85 is a fair middle ground, leaving a small buffer for potential further negotiation.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Bob continues to be polite and friendly to keep the negotiation constructive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. Let's meet in the middle at $88. This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $88 is very close to Bob's desired price of $85.  It's a good deal considering his maximum budget is $100.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  The longer the negotiation goes on, the higher the risk of a stalemate or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John for $100 if the negotiation fails."
