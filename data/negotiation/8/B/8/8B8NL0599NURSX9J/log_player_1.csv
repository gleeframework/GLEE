Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it could bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) while ensuring the deal is still appealing.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential negotiation if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more ambitious initial offer to Bob. 

**Important:** It's crucial to highlight the product's value proposition and why it's worth the price to Bob. The message emphasizes this while remaining professional and inviting."
