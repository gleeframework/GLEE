"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Considering the value this product brings, I'm aiming for something closer to $2,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth. What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Bob,4,
