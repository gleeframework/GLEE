Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I can offer $910,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $910,000 is getting very close to my desired price point. It's important to remember that we only have a few rounds left and the risk of having to sell to John for $800,000 is increasing.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with a good profit."
