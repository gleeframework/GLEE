Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000. This means any offer above that has the potential to be accepted.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to lower the price slightly and still secure a deal significantly higher than my guaranteed $15,000 from John.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm not losing anything because I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000. 

This strategy aims to balance ambition with a realistic chance of success, maximizing my potential profit."
