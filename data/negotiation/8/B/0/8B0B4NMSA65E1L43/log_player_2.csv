"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still a bit high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still hoping to get a better deal. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice down to your original counteroffer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $105. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
