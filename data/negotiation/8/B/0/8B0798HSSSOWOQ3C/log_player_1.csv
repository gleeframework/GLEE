"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get the best possible price.  I'm aware that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, but I'm aiming for a profit. I'll be ready to negotiate if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $14,200. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already in round 4 and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $14,200 is a good profit for me and still a fair price for Bob."
