It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to potentially save some money."

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price considering John is selling it for $15,000. It's worth accepting this offer to save $4,000."
