Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is high enough to leave room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately accepting a price below my minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while also leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob. If he rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $12,000?  That's still a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $12,000 is a good price, I believe there's still room for a better deal.  Bob is clearly willing to pay more than my minimum, and I want to explore that further.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that aligns with my profit goals. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This strengthens my bargaining position. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $12,000 but lower than my initial offer. This will show a willingness to negotiate while still seeking a profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my original price point.  How about $13,000? This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $14,000. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, emphasizing that $13,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution for both of us, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price.

This counteroffer positions me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome while still maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $12,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids me having to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  $12,500 is very close to my minimum price of $10,000, and it's still a significant profit.
* **Avoiding John:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing him and ending up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Potential for Future Dealings:**  Accepting this offer builds a positive relationship with Bob, which could lead to future business opportunities.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good profit, minimize risk, and potentially open the door for future transactions."
