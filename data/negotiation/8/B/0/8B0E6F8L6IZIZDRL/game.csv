"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds interesting, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to lower the price to $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1100000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm ready to offer $1050000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that it's worth it for you. I'll sell it to you for $1075000. This is my final offer on this price point, so I hope we can agree on this.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
