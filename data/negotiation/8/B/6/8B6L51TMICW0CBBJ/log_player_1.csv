{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly above your minimum but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still try to get a better price. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer and see if you can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a little something. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is only $2 less than your previous counteroffer of $110, and it's above your minimum price of $100.  Accepting this offer is the best option to maximize your profit in this scenario."
