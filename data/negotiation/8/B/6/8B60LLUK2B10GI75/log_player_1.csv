Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value while still being attractive to Bob.  I'll observe his response to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I need to be flexible, I'm not willing to drop so low this early in the negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and provides you with a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
