Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning that you'll list it publicly implies that this is a limited-time offer, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
