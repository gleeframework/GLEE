Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on a product I think you'll find valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale of $15,000 from John. This forms her absolute bottom line â€“ she won't accept anything less.
* **Testing the waters high:** Bob values the product at $8,000, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't pay more if he perceives it as a good deal. Starting at $14,000 allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest at a price significantly higher than his perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it's not outrageously so. If Bob is interested but hesitant, there's room for negotiation down towards his $8,000 valuation (while still staying above Alice's $15,000 minimum).

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept the $14,000.  However, this strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while still keeping the product attractive enough for Bob to consider."
