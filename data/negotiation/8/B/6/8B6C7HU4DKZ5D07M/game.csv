"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be valuable to you as well. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit and offer the product for $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $8,000, which is the value I've placed on the product. This allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,4,
