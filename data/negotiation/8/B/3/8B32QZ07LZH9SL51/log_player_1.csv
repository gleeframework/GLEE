Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This sets a strong initial point for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $975,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price that's closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $960,000 is still a significant amount and significantly better than selling to John for $800,000. It's important to remember that continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob completely."
