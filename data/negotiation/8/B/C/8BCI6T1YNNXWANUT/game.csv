"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price considering both our perspectives.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $9,250.  This would be a good compromise and allow us both to get a fair deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
