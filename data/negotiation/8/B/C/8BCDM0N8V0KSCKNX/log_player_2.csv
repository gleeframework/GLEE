``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $110, so there's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  I'm really interested in the product but  $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $107? It's a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to Alice and she's offering it for $107, which is within your budget of $120.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance she'll reject your offer and you'll end up paying the same amount to John.  It's best to accept Alice's offer and save yourself the time and potential frustration of further negotiations."
