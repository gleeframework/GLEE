Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, opening with a higher price gives us negotiation room. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in Bob's mind. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"" we're implying there are other potential buyers, creating a sense of scarcity and urgency. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** We don't want to scare Bob off entirely. Asking ""What do you think?"" invites him to counter-offer and keeps the dialogue open.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, we haven't lost anything.  We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so we have leverage to negotiate with Bob within that range."
