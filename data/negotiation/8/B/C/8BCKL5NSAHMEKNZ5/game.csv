"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you and allows me to get a great price for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still interested in working with you, but $920,000 is still a bit below my target. How about we compromise at $940,000? It's a fair price that's closer to your offer, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen.",940000.0,Alice,5,
