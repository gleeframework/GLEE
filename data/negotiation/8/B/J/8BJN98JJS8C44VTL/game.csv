"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $14000. I can do $16000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $14500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14500 is as high as you can go, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $14500, which is $15250. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $14500. I'm not comfortable going any higher than that. I'm starting to think about buying from John, though, if we can't come to an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,6,
