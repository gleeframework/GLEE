"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, so I'll counter with $1,250,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I initially hoped for more, $1,200,000 is a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
