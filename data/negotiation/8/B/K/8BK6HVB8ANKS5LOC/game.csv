"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $130 is a bit too low for me to sell at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That way we both walk away happy with a fair deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
