"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional quality and features. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $850000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to come up to $825000.  This is a fair price given my budget, and I believe we can finalize a deal at this level.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $850000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $20000. This way, you'll get the product and a bonus service that will make it even more valuable to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
