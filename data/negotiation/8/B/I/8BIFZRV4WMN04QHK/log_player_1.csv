{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something that can be truly valuable for you, and I believe it's worth $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming high. It's important to remember that you have a safety net with John, so you're not under pressure to accept a low price. By starting at $1,200,000, you leave room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's more strategic to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer strikes a balance. It's higher than Bob's offer, but it's lower than your initial price, showing flexibility. It also includes a message that highlights the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has moved closer to your initial ask,  $950,000 is still lower than what you're willing to accept.  Since you have the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, it's still more strategic to reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $975,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Bob's offer, showing that you're willing to negotiate. It also emphasizes the value of the product and the fairness of the offer. This strategy aims to encourage Bob to accept, while still keeping your earnings above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $975,000. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is still lower than your minimum. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further back-and-forth without a guaranteed outcome is high.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 is the safest and most financially beneficial option at this point."
