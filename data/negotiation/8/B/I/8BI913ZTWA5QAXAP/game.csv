"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $22,000.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $18,000 is a bit lower than what I initially had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $20,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about $19,000? This is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my desire to make a deal.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $19,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.",18250.0,Bob,6,
