Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely still get a better price by negotiating with Alice. It's possible to get the price down to $9,500, which is a better deal than $10,250."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to accept and save money compared to John's price, Bob has shown he can negotiate Alice down further.  There's still room to get closer to his desired price of $9,500."
