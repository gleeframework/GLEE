"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $12,000? This is still a fair price for the value you place on it and it's within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is still a great price for the value it holds for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $14,000.  I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in this product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
