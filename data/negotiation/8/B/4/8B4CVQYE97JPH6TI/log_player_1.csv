"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $20,000. I believe it's a great value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with him. There's a chance I can get a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. I'm also willing to consider selling to John, but I'll hold off on that for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $15,000 is my absolute minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $17,500 for this product.  It's a significant investment for me, but I'm motivated to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $17500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and it's higher than what John is offering. With 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and getting stuck with John's lower offer. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
