# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you made a counteroffer. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price for the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees the best price for Bob."
