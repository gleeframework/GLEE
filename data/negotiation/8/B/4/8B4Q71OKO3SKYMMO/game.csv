"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for 1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
