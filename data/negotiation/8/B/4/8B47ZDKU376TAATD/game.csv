"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go below $13500. This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet in the middle at $13750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $13750 is closer to my price point, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $13500. I believe this would be a fair deal, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $13750. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",13750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're close now, but $13750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $13625. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.  Let's get it done!",13625.0,Bob,6,
