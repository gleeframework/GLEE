"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This strategy employs a strong initial counter-offer significantly below my maximum budget. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A low offer will reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Establish a negotiation range:** My ideal price is much lower than Alice's starting point. By countering low, I set the stage for potential compromise within a range closer to my target.

However, I'm ready to adjust my counteroffers in subsequent rounds depending on Alice's reactions and remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can we discuss $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $160 is still far from my ideal price. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet closer to the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Alice made a significant jump from $180 to $160, indicating some flexibility. Proposing $100 aims for a compromise closer to the middle ground of our current positions.
* **Strategic Increment:** While still below my maximum budget, this offer represents a substantial increase from my previous $60, demonstrating my willingness to move towards her price point. 
* **Time Consideration:** We are in Round 4, and I need to assess Alice's willingness to negotiate further. This offer will help me gauge if a deal significantly below $160 is achievable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I might consider, but there's still room for negotiation. $140 is still a significant amount over my ideal price. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a more substantial price drop before I accept.  We are getting closer to the halfway point in the rounds, so maintaining pressure is important."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. I'm ready to make a move to show I'm serious. How about $115? That's a fair offer considering the original price."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  By jumping from $100 to $115, I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise and meet Alice closer to her price range.
* **Justification:** I've included a reference to the original price, subtly reminding Alice of the significant difference we've already bridged. 
* **Urgency:** With only 5 rounds left, this offer creates a sense of urgency and shows Alice I'm motivated to close the deal, but not at any cost.

This offer balances pushing for a better price while acknowledging Alice's need to make a profit. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. I'm willing to budge a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is the closest Alice has come to my ideal price, I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal. Rejecting this offer maintains the pressure on Alice, especially with only four rounds remaining. I'm willing to risk getting closer to my walk-away point to potentially save another $10-$20."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. I can go as high as $120, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's get this done!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer signals to Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product, but not willing to budge further. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  With only three rounds remaining, including this one, emphasizing that $120 is my ""absolute limit"" creates a sense of urgency. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By staying firm at $120, I'm still below my walk-away price while aiming for a price that's more favorable than Alice's last offer.

This offer represents a calculated risk. There's a chance Alice might accept, securing me a reasonable deal. However, if she rejects it, I'm prepared to walk away and buy the product from John for $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your commitment to making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $120, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated she won't go below $125.  Even at $125,  I'm losing out on the opportunity to buy the product for $80 from John. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
