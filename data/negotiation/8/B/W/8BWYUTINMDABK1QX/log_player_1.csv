Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value of $120, but also want to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still staying below my ideal price point.  I want to see if we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price point and close to my ideal price. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
