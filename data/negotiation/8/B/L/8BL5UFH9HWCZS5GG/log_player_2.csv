"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $140. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to haggle Alice down further, accepting the $140 offer is the best move. Here's why:

* **Savings:** I save $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting her offer in hopes of a lower price is risky. She might not budge, and I'd end up paying $150 anyway."
