{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn a bit more than my minimum price.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand $12,000 is a bit high, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering Bob a price that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm also trying to emphasize the value of the product and the fairness of the price. Hopefully, this will convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's better to sell to John at my minimum price than continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with less."
