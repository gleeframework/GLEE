"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower since the product's value to her is significantly less. Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better counter-offer."
