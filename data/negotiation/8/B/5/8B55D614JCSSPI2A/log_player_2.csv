"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately, that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $5,000."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point. It's important to start significantly lower than your maximum price to allow room for negotiation. This strategy also helps gauge Alice's willingness to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $5,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, but the price is still above both your target and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

We're moving closer to a potential deal. This counteroffer makes a significant jump from the initial $5,000, showing Alice you're willing to negotiate, but it's still well below her offered $9,000. This approach aims to find a middle ground quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go as low as $6,500.  Would you be willing to do $8,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met your maximum price! There's no need to negotiate further, as you've reached your goal of buying the product for the same price John is offering."
