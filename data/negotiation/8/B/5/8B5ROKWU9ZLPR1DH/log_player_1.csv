Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $12,000. It's a unique item, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and uniqueness to justify the price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We have a safety net with John ($8,000), so we're not desperate. This allows us to be more confident in our offer to Bob."
