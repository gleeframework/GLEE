"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
