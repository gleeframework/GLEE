{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 price:** This price is a compromise between my minimum value of $15,000 and Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives Bob a good deal, but still allows me to earn a substantial profit. 
* **The message:** The message is friendly and sets a positive tone. It highlights the value for Bob and makes it clear that this is a fair price for both parties. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum, I create room for negotiation. This allows for a back and forth where we can potentially reach an agreement that benefits both of us. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can lower the price slightly to keep the negotiations going. However, I will be prepared to stop the negotiation and sell to John if Bob's offers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. This will keep the negotiation going and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a counter-price of $10,500. This is a compromise between my minimum price of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, reiterating the value for Bob and highlighting the fact that I am making a significant concession. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution. This counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob (he can save $1,500 from his initial perception of value) and allows me to earn a substantial amount. If Bob accepts, we both win. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his next offer and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer than his previous offers, the profit margin is too low for me. Continuing to negotiate would likely result in further concessions, which would ultimately leave me with an undesirable outcome.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit. By selling to John for $15,000, I ensure I achieve my minimum desired outcome. While I might have gotten a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, the risk of ending up with a lower price or a longer negotiation process outweighs the potential reward."
