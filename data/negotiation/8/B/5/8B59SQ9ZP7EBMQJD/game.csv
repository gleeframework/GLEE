"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $950,000. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. While $950,000 is tempting, I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
