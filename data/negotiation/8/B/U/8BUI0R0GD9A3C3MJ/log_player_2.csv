"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special offer considering its value to you is $12,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can settle on a price closer to $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) creates room for negotiation and gives Alice the opportunity to counter.  While it's a lowball offer, it leaves space for a mutually agreeable price point. 
* **Signaling Interest:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest, encouraging her to continue the negotiation. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** By mentioning a price closer to John's offer,  we subtly remind Alice that we have other options if a deal can't be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. For your consideration, I propose a price of $12,500 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved significantly closer to your desired price, but it's still possible to get a better deal.  Since you can get the product for $12,000 from John, it's worth one more counteroffer to see if Alice will meet that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still very interested in the product, but $12,500 is a little too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet at $11,500?  I think that's a fair price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer aims for a compromise by splitting the difference between Alice's current offer ($12,500) and your target price ($10,000).  
* **Maintaining Interest:**  The message continues to express strong interest, which can motivate Alice to close the deal.
* **Pressure Point:** Offering $11,500 puts pressure on Alice. She knows you have the $12,000 option with John. She needs to decide if it's worth losing the sale over a relatively small difference."
