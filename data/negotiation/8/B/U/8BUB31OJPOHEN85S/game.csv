"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $725,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",725000.0,Alice,5,
