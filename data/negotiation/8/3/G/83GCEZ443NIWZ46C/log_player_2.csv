"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000), but still significantly lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000). You can definitely do better. It's worth exploring counteroffers and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product's value, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. I believe this price is fair, considering it's still significantly above your worth of $800,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to you.
