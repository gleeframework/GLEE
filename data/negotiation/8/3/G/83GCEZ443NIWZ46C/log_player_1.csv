Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product's value, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. I believe this price is fair, considering it's still significantly above your worth of $800,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.
