"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product's value, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. I believe this price is fair, considering it's still significantly above your worth of $800,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is exactly what the product is worth to you. It's a fair price, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
