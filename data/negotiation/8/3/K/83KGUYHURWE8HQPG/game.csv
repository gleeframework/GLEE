,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $14000. I think this is a fair price for a great product, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is the absolute minimum I can do. If you're serious about the product, I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $14500. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to consider it.",17000.0,Alice,7,
