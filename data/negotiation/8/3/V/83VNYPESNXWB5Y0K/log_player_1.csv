Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is our guaranteed backup at $15,000, we want to see if we can get more from Bob.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:**  We start high but leave a tiny bit of room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle (though we shouldn't go below $15,000).
* **Psychological Pricing:** The $14,999 price point feels significantly lower than $15,000 and might make Bob more amenable."
