"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",95.0,Alice,3,
