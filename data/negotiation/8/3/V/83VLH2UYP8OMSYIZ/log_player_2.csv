"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth more than the asking price in the long run. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not interested in paying $20,000 for the product. It's too expensive for me. I'll reject Alice's offer.
