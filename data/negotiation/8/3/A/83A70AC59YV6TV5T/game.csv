"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant value it holds.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this revised offer reflects the value while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm adjusting my offer to $975,000. This price reflects a significant reduction on my end and ensures you're getting a fair deal on a truly valuable product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $925,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your commitment to this deal. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
