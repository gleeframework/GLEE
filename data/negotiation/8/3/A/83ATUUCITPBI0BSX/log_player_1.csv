Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly more than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** There's a potential for Bob to counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm reminding Bob that I have an alternative buyer (John) who will pay my minimum value. This creates a sense of urgency and limits Bob's ability to play hardball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000 and even below my initial offer. Accepting would be a major loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate. There's potential to find a middle ground.
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away. This puts pressure on him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't work for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own financial goals.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** I'm not willing to go below $1,300,000, but I'm still offering a price lower than my minimum value. This demonstrates a commitment to reaching an agreement while leaving room for further discussion.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  I reiterate the idea of a ""win-win"" situation.  Focusing on mutual profit can make Bob more receptive to a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to get this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $1,150,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation might result in a slight increase, but it's unlikely to reach a point where it's financially advantageous for me.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum value. There's no risk or uncertainty involved in selling to John.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on and waste valuable time. Selling to John immediately ensures I get the best possible price without further negotiation or risk."
