Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.

We're getting closer, but $100 is still more than I'd like to pay.  Another counteroffer might get us closer to a price we both find acceptable."
