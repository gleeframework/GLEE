"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. However, I'm open to negotiation. Would you be interested in discussing a price that works well for both of us? If not, don't worry, I have another interested party, John, who is ready to purchase it for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is trying to negotiate from a position of strength, but her tactics are transparent.  You know John will sell the product to you for $120, which is your maximum price. There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice further."
