"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it still represents a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,200 for the product. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price of $13,000. While Bob's offer is tempting, I think I can still squeeze out a bit more by making another counteroffer. There are only 6 rounds left, so I need to be strategic and not give in too quickly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and come down to $12,350. This represents a substantial discount for you, and it's the best I can do at this point. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12350}
