Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and constraints:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see the value in.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This represents a significant discount compared to its true worth to you, while still providing me with a fair return on my investment.  What do you say? "",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Guarantee a Sale:** Offering it at or slightly above John's offer ($1,200,000) guarantees a sale, but leaves potential profit on the table. 
* **Finding a Balance:** The offer of $1,400,000 aims to split the difference between Bob's valuation and Alice's minimum. This creates a win-win scenario: 
    * Bob saves $100,000 compared to his perceived value.
    * Alice makes a $200,000 profit over her guaranteed sale price.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is an art. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, and Alice will need to decide if she wants to negotiate further or take John's guaranteed price."
