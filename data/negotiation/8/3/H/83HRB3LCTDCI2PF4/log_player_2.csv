"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds great value to me, but I understand its worth might be different for you. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Let me know if this price works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum price point of $120, it makes sense to accept the offer and avoid any further negotiation."
