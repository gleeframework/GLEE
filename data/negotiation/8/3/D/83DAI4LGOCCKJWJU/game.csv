"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I have a firm budget.  Would you consider $725,000? It's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $725,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000.  This price allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is very close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $775,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and would allow us to close the deal today.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still a significant gap for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000 as a final compromise. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal now.",825000.0,Alice,7,
