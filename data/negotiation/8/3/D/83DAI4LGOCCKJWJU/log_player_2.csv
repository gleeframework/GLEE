Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $650,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $725,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000.  This price allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but we can still try to push Alice a bit further down.  We're only $50,000 away from John's price, and Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is very close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $775,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and would allow us to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still a significant gap for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000 as a final compromise. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000 at this point. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing out on the $800,000 deal with John."
