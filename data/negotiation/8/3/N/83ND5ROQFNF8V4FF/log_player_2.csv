"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $180. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. You should definitely try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upward if needed.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your price limit. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** The $100 counteroffer aims to secure a significant discount and stay well below your maximum budget of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $140 is closer to your budget, it's still above what John is offering. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your $120 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** You've now countered twice, and it's time to be more direct with your ideal price. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason like ""a fair deal for both of us"" can make your offer more persuasive.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $120, so there's no need to go higher than this."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $120. I'm willing to go up a bit more, to $145. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly on her price. Her latest offer of $145 is still considerably higher than John's price of $120. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best available price."
