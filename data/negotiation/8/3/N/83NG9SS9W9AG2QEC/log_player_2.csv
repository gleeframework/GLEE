```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I understand that's still a bit above your initial offer, but I believe the product's value justifies it. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than the initial price, there's still room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $880,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $900,000? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that I can get the price down further. Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $880,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $880,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $900,000, but I'll throw in some extras that will sweeten the deal for you. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive support package. This way, you'll get more value for your money. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is starting to get close to my target price, and the added value of the warranty and support package makes it more appealing.  While I'd prefer to get it for $880,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise.  It's important to consider that there are only three rounds left before I'm forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and allows me to avoid potentially losing out on the product altogether."
