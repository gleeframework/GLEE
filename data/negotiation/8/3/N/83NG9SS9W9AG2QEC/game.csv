"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I understand that's still a bit above your initial offer, but I believe the product's value justifies it. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my seriousness in making this deal happen.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $880,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $900,000? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $880,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $880,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $900,000, but I'll throw in some extras that will sweeten the deal for you. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive support package. This way, you'll get more value for your money. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
