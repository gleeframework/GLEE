"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [product name] at a price significantly lower than its true value. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal that allows you to significantly increase your profit potential. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who values it at $1,500,000. I believe this offer is mutually beneficial and would love to discuss it further with you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
