"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1750000. This price reflects the potential value I see in it for you.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not interested in paying $1,750,000 for the product. That's above my budget of $1,200,000. I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000.
