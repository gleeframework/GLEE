Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects the significant benefits it offers. However, I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you know the product's value to Bob ($1,200,000) and have a guaranteed sale to John at that price, you have leverage. Starting high at $1,500,000 aims to capture the most potential profit.
* **Justification and Openness:** The message justifies the high price by emphasizing the product's value while leaving room for negotiation (""open to discussing...""). This makes Bob feel considered and not immediately turned off by an extreme price. 
* **Balancing Act:** The offer aims to find the sweet spot between an unrealistically high price (risking immediate rejection) and undervaluing the product.  

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might come back with a counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still maximizing your profit."
