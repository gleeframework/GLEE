"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get it for less. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** Bob's initial counteroffer is $1,500 lower than Alice's offer, showing he's serious about negotiating.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  Offering $8,500  demonstrates that Bob is open to a deal, but also that he's not willing to pay Alice's full asking price. 
* **Keep the option open:** By leaving the door open for further negotiation, Bob can see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible. While $9,500 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still above his target of $8,000. He can try to negotiate further in the next round.  There's a chance that Alice might be willing to lower her price again to close the deal, especially considering she's already lowered it once."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering we're both looking to make a deal. Let's see if we can close this."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is a smaller decrease compared to the previous round, suggesting he's getting closer to his target but not rushing to accept.
* **Highlighting fairness:** Bob emphasizes the ""fair"" aspect of the offer, implying a win-win situation for both parties. 
* **Closing the deal:** By mentioning ""closing the deal,"" Bob subtly increases the pressure on Alice to accept."
