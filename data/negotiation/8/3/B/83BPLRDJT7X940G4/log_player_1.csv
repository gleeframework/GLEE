"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly below my minimum acceptable value ($120). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit. I'm also expressing confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm also emphasizing the product's worth to justify my counteroffer. This shows a commitment to a deal while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $80 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $85. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120, it's getting closer, and I'm already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I'm confident that Bob won't go any higher, and continuing to reject offers might lead to him losing interest entirely.  Selling to John for $120 is still an option, but accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of missing out on a deal."
