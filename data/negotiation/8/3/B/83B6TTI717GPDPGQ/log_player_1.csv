I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is a reasonable compromise and it's better than selling to John for $120."
