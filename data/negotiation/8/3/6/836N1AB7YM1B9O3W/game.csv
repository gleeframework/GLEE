"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I value this product, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm offering $10,250. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that.",10750.0,Alice,5,
