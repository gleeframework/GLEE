"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $10,000 to him, and Alice's offer is $2,000 higher than that. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Alice has come down a bit, but $11,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to try and negotiate a price closer to his $9,500 counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I value this product, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm offering $10,250. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  Since Bob can purchase the product for $10,000 from John, it is in his best interest to buy it from John."
