"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $180 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $150 is a bit lower than what I need to get for it.  How about $165?  That gives us both some room to negotiate.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $157.50.  It's a fair price for both of us.",157.5,Bob,4,
