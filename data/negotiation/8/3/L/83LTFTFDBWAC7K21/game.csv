"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. Would you be willing to go down to $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",11000.0,Bob,4,
