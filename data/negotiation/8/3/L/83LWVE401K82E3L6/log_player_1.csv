Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000 for a swift deal. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently trying to meet in the middle, which is a good negotiation tactic on his part. However, we're still significantly above John's offer.  I'm willing to push the negotiation a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,787,500? I think that's a fair deal that considers both of our positions."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your proposal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $1,750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,800,000, Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting $1,750,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
