"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $950,000. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a good price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",900000.0,Bob,4,
