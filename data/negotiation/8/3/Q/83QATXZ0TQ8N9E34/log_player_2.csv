"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Bob and Alice, there is no immediate advantage to accepting Alice's offer. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Would you be open to discussing that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the best I can do at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price. It's worth rejecting and attempting to negotiate further to try and get the price closer to $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I think this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still more than Bob's initial target of $1,000,000, it's a significant improvement from Alice's initial asking price of $1,200,000.  

Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price, saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
