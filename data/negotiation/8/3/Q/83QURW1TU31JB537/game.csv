"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $10000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $12500, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet your price. I would like to propose $11000 as a fair compromise. I hope this meets within your acceptable range.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll propose a price of $12250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise.",12250.0,Alice,5,
