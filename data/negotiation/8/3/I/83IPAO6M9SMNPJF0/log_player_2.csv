{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before going to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $110? That gives us both some room to be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on your price. $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
