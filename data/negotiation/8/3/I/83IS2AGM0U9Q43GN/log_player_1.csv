Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to him and at least $80 to me.  It leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer of $95 is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price than John's offer, and it's likely that further negotiation might not get me a significantly better price."
