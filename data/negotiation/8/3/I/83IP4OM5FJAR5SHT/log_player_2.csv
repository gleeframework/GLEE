"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, you can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.  There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since she values the product at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal. Would you consider $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $92 for the product. This allows for a fair transaction while still providing a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $95 to $92.  This is a good deal for you, as it's within your budget and saves you $8 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
