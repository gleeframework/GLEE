Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. It's a great deal for something of such high quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you know Bob values the product at $80, and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, starting high leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $120, you set a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to end up with a price higher than $80.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $120 price, netting you a significant profit. 
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
