"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know it's a significant investment, but this product has incredible potential. Let's discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its potential.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $650,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This offers you a substantial upside potential while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,000,000 is still pushing my budget. I can go up to $725,000.  I believe that's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal work.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $725,000 is still too far below the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,7,
