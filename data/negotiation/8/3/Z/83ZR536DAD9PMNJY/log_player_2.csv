Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its potential."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $650,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This offers you a substantial upside potential while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,000,000 is still pushing my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $725,000 is still too far below the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. She's still significantly above my $800,000 maximum, and I have a guaranteed option with John at that price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a reasonable cost."
