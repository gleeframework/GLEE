"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate your enthusiasm.  $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for though. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's acknowledging Alice's offer but demonstrating that he's willing to negotiate.  Offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's closer to Alice's minimum price point of $12,000, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $12,800, which is only $800 more than Bob's ideal price of $12,000.  Considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, this is a good deal and a fair compromise.  Accepting the offer means Bob gets the product at a lower price than John's and avoids further negotiations."
