Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price ($150), there's no incentive to offer a lower price to Bob.  You maximize your potential profit by starting at the highest price Bob might accept. While it's possible Bob might accept a price of $150, it's unlikely given his perceived value is much lower. However, you lose nothing by trying."
