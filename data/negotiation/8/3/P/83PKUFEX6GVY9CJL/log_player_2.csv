"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're looking to spend no more than $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to benefit from the sale. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your target of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to consider a price of $980,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is still too high for Bob's budget.  While there's a chance of further negotiation, it's likely that Alice will hold firm on a price closer to her value than Bob's. It's more beneficial for Bob to purchase from John at $800,000, ensuring a deal within his desired price range."
