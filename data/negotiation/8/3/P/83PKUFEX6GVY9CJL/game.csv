"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value to me.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to benefit from the sale. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to consider a price of $980,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",980000.0,Alice,5,
