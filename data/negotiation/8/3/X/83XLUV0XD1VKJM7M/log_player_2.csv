"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than his budget and he can get a better deal either by counter-offering or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob is offering $13,000, which is still within his budget and a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This should start the negotiation process and see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should reject the offer and counter with a lower price, as he can still get a better deal from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is again offering a lower price, $14,000. This is a compromise from his previous offer, showing he's willing to negotiate. He's trying to find a middle ground between his maximum budget and Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, but he should still reject the offer.  He's only willing to pay $12,000, and he can get it from John.  There's no reason to accept a price higher than that, even if it's only a small difference."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob is offering $13,500. This is still within his budget, and a compromise from his previous offer, showing he's willing to negotiate but not willing to go above his limit. This offer puts the pressure back on Alice to consider accepting or coming down further in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still unwilling to come down to Bob's desired price point. At this point, Bob has no reason to continue the negotiation with Alice. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, which is his maximum budget and a better deal than anything Alice is offering."
