"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you'd prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $110 is still within your budget of $120 and saves you $10 compared to John.
* **Rejecting the offer risks losing out on the product entirely.** There's no guarantee that John will still have the product if you reject Alice's offer."
