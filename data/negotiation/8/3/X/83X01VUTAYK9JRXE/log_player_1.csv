Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Prepared for counteroffer:** I'm ready to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, as I have a clear fallback option with John. 
* **Strategic price:** This price allows me to potentially maximize my earnings while still having a good chance of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value to each of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a potential $400,000 profit from selling to John.
* **Negotiation power:** I have a strong negotiating position because I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I can afford to be patient and hold out for a better offer. 

**Next step:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still significantly above his initial offer, aiming to secure a higher profit.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Building a relationship:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing collaboration to keep the negotiation open and positive. 
* **Maintaining a high price:**  I'm still aiming for a price well above Bob's initial offer, but this counteroffer opens the door for a potential compromise."
