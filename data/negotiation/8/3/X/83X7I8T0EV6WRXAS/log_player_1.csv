Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $100, which I think is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 (your secured sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  The price is significantly lower than his perceived value.
* **Profitable for You:**  The price is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price."
