"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob is now quite close to my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether.  Accepting $13,000 secures a profit and avoids potentially leaving money on the table by going with John."
