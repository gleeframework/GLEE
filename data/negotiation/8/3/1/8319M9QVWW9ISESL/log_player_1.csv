"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I know the product is worth significantly more to Bob. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still far below the product's true value to him. There are still rounds left, and I'm confident that I can push for a price closer to $900,000. I'm not willing to sell to John yet as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $875,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. How about we meet at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle. I've made significant concessions and believe I can push for a better price. There are still rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a deal that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $850,000.  This is my final offer before I move on to other options.  It's a fair price that recognizes both our needs. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. Can we really meet at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire.  I've made significant concessions, but Bob is unwilling to budge much further. While $825,000 is better than my minimum, it's still not ideal. With only two rounds left, the risk of a stalemate is too high, and it's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
