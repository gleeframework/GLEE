"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from $15,000.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $13,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $13,500 is lower than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **It's a good deal:** Bob is saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. 
* **There's a risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice might reject future counteroffers, pushing Bob closer to the $15,000 price from John.

Given the current offer is within Bob's budget and offers a decent saving, it's a good strategy to accept and close the deal."
