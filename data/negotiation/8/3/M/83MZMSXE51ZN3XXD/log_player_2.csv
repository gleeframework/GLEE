"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to start negotiating, even if the first offer is your maximum. This allows you to see if Alice is willing to lower her price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However,  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
