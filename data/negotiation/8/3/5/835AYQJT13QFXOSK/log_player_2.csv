"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal and worth every penny! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $130. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. This is still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to drop the price a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $115? It's a fair price that's reasonable for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I can do $120, which is my absolute minimum. This way we both get a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now $120, which is exactly the price Bob would be willing to pay for the product from John.  There's no need to continue negotiating as Bob can get the product at the same price from another seller."
