"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.  As Bob, I'm aiming for the lowest possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm working with a tight budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my target. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and hopefully secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, I'm still feeling a bit stretched at $900,000. Would you be willing to come down to $875,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to secure the product and you to receive a price closer to your valuation."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $887,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price points. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is a fair compromise, considering my initial goal was $850,000.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price that is within my budget and still saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  There is a risk that I could get a slightly better price by continuing negotiations, but there is also the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice rejecting further offers and leaving me with no product.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action."
