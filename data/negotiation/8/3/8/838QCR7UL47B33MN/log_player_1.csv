Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm working with a tight budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is a decent amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come closer to a mutually acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, I'm still feeling a bit stretched at $900,000. Would you be willing to come down to $875,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to secure the product and you to receive a price closer to your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $950,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $887,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price points."", ""product_price"": 887500}
