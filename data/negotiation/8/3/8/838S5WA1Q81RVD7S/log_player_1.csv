"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000. This feels more aligned with what I am willing to pay given my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is more than I would get if I sold to John right now, I think I can still get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to make this deal work. This still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a fair price. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal of $10,000. It aligns better with my budget and the value I place on the product. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I would like to get more, Bob is adamant about $10,000 and it's unlikely he'll budge. John is offering me a guaranteed $15,000, which is far more beneficial than risking further negotiation with Bob."
