"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me move this product along quickly.  Let me know if you're interested.",115.0,Alice,3,

I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going.,112.0,Bob,4,
