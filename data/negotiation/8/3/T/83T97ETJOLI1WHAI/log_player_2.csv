"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair, considering its worth to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $13,000, which is $2,000 less than your maximum budget and $2,000 more than her valuation. This seems like a fair deal, and it's better than buying from John for $15,000."
