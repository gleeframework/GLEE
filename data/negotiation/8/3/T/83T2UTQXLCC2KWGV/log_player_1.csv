Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds to try and get a better deal. I'll counteroffer Bob again."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob and I are close on price, but I'm starting to run out of rounds.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob, and I'm worried if I keep rejecting, he might walk away entirely.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,000,000, I'm going to sell the product to John and avoid any further risk."
