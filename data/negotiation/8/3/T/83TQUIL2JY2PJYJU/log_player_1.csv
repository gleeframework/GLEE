Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below your minimum of $120. It allows room for negotiation without risking losing Bob as a customer entirely.  I'm also setting a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $65 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's counteroffer. It signals my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on a fair price for the product."
