Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a discount:** It's lower than the product's worth to Bob, making it attractive.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still potential to go higher, allowing for a potentially win-win scenario.
* **Doesn't undervalue the product:**  It's above the minimum I'm willing to accept from John, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $85, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to $90, I'm not sure I can push him further.  At this point, it's better to secure a sale at $85 and avoid risking losing him completely or having to sell to John for $80."
