{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it, considering its potential value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob's value for the product is $12,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially settle on a price that's closer to his value.
* **It's not too aggressive:** This price isn't so high that it immediately discourages Bob from negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it to me for $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is only slightly lower than your last counteroffer, and it's very close to your minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation, which could risk losing the deal completely."
