"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
 
This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation. It's also friendly and encouraging to hopefully make Bob feel good about potential future deals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and I go down to $112.50? This would still give you a good deal while helping me reach my target."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to keep my spending within $100. Could you consider $100 as a fair offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is tempting, I'm still committed to earning at least $112.50, as it's closer to my target price.  I'll reject the offer again and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to get a bit worried that we might not be able to come to an agreement.  I'm really flexible, but I can't go lower than $105.  This would give you a great deal while still allowing me to cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for $100. Can we meet in the middle at $102.5? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $102.5 is closer to my minimum, it still doesn't meet my goal of $112.50. I'll keep trying to negotiate with Bob, but if he doesn't budge further, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $103.50, which is a big compromise on my end.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this, I'll have to go with another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 103.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Considering your last offer, I believe $103 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $103
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I only have two rounds left.  I've already made significant compromises, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than what John is willing to pay.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
