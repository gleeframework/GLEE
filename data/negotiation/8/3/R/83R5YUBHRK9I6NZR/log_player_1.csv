Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $120.  Offering it slightly below this value increases the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a fallback option with John at $100. This means she can afford to aim higher with Bob.
* **Psychology:** Offering a precise number like $115 can sometimes seem more appealing and thoughtful than a rounded number like $120."
