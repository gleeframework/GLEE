Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. While I have a guaranteed $150 from John, getting more from Bob is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, potentially pushing the price closer to $150. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  Highlighting the product's value might make the price more appealing to Bob, even if it's slightly above his perceived worth. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I increase my chances of selling the product to Bob for a price higher than my minimum while still having John as a backup option."
