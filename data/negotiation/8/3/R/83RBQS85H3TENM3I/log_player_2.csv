Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to go below $12,000.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a tiny bit more, it's not worth the risk of losing the $10,000 deal with John. You're better off securing the product at your target price."
