Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $300,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,500,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer.  A good strategy is to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Justification:** You mention a ""fair price"" and ""significant return on investment,"" implying Bob would be getting more value than he's paying for.
* **Price Point:** $1,400,000  allows you to capture a large portion of the potential profit while still giving Bob a perceived discount of $100,000 from his perceived value.
* **Urgency:** The closing sentence subtly creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. Depending on your understanding of Bob's negotiating style (e.g., is he risk-averse or a tough negotiator?), you might adjust the price and message accordingly."
