"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it holds for me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our respective interests and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,050,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
