# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

* Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still higher than my ideal price.  
* I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.
* I have 9 more rounds to reach a deal, so I'm not in a rush to accept the first offer."

I'd like to counter with an offer of $500,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 500000}
