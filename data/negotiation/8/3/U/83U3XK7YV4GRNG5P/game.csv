"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I believe it will be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,200,000. This price is fair and allows us to close the deal quickly.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
