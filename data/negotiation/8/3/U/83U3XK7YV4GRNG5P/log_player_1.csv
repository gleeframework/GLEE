"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $1,150,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,200,000. This price is fair and allows us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to come up to a price that's acceptable to me.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the best option to ensure I secure a decent sale price."
