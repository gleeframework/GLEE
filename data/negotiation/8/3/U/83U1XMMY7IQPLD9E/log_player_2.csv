"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. This is a great price for a product worth so much to you. Let's work together to make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This gives you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  You have more negotiating room, and it's worth trying to get Alice to come down further."
