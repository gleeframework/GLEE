The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking for $150. It's too expensive. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $110 for the product. It's a fair price, considering it's worth $120 to me, and I'm willing to pay a slight premium."

Alice's offer is still too high, and I've only got 5 rounds left.  It's not worth risking getting stuck with a price I'm unhappy with.  I'll go with John's offer of $120."
