"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go back to our initial offer of $900,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
