"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $13,500 is a tempting price, I'm still hoping to get it for closer to $12,000. Would you consider that final offer?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really close to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000. I can sell the product to you for $12,750. This is my final offer. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,7,
