Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, giving Bob incentive to accept.
* **It's a clear starting point:**  It lets Bob know you're serious about selling and gives him something concrete to respond to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is still a profit for you, it's closer to your minimum value. By rejecting, you can try to get a better price. You can use Bob's counteroffer as leverage to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $100 is a bit too low for me right now, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to your desired price. 
* **Be firm but fair:**  The message emphasizes your value while remaining open to negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's initial offer, you've shown you're not desperate and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting very close to your minimum price. While $90 is still a profit, it's not a significant one, and there's a high chance he'll continue to push for a lower price. Selling to John for $80 ensures a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
