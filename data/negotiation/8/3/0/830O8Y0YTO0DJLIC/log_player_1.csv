Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $2,300,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has intrinsic value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a more substantial counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000.

Explanation:

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he won't exceed his perceived value of $800,000 by much. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome for me than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
