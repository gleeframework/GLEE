"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",14250.0,Alice,5,
