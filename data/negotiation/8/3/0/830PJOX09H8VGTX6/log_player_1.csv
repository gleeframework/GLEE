"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without immediately resorting to my backup buyer, John. 

**Note:** I'm aware that my minimum acceptable price is $15,000. However, starting higher gives me more flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $18,000.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that is closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that it will be a good investment for him.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, but it also shows that I'm serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further concessions, and I'm not confident I'll get a better price. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable amount. 

**In this situation, the certainty of a guaranteed profit from John outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob. I'm choosing to close the deal with John to secure my desired profit.**"
