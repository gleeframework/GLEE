"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but that price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm happy to consider your counteroffer. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $700,000?  I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're able to have a productive conversation. However, I still think the product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I have to say that if we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer for now.",900000.0,Alice,5,
