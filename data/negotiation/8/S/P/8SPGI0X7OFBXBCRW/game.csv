"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I still need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $12500.",12500.0,Alice,5,
