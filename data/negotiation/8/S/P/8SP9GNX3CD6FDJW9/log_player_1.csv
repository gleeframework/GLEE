"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping for a better offer, as his value for the product is significantly higher than mine.  Selling to John at this point would be a loss compared to what Bob is potentially willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I can get from John.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation, hoping Bob will increase his offer further.  The goal is to get as close to his $1,200,000 value as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints.  However, $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product holds for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as I can. I'd be willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While there's a chance he might raise his offer in the next round, I'm running out of time and the risk of further negotiation is too high. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a safe and secure deal."
