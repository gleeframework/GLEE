Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my desired price. I know Bob values the product at $100, but I need to make at least $120 to be satisfied.  Let's see if he's willing to pay my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get my asking price of $120, Bob's counteroffer of $110 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum value of $120 and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
