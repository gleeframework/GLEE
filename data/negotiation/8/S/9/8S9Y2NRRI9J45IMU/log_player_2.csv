"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is higher than that. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about saving money.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still higher than what he wants to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's initial counteroffer and Alice's latest offer.  It shows Bob is willing to move closer to Alice's price point but still wants to pay less than $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still a little high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down in price.  It is still possible that Alice might accept a counteroffer closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

Bob is now willing to pay his maximum value for the product. This is his final offer, as going lower would risk losing the deal and having to buy from John.  It's likely that Alice will accept this offer as it's very close to her previous offer."
