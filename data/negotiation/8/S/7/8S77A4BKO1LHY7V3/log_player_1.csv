Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product holds a certain value for me, but  $2,200,000 is not feasible. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.

Bob is not demonstrating a willingness to offer a price close to the product's value to me.  It's time to move on to John who is offering a price that guarantees my minimum acceptable amount."
