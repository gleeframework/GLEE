"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's start the negotiation there.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding your perspective. While $800,000 is significantly lower than I'm aiming for, I'm open to negotiation. To move things forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
