Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's start the negotiation there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer.  

* **Bob's latest offer:** $1,400,000
* **John's guaranteed offer:** $1,500,000

At this point, the potential gains from continuing negotiations with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him not reaching the $1,500,000 mark. It's a better business decision to secure the guaranteed amount with John."
