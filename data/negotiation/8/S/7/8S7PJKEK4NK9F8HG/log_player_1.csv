Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. It's worth exploring further negotiation rounds before accepting his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $775,000. I'm trying to make a smart investment, and I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $775,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm going to keep negotiating, as selling to John at $800,000 is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This price recognizes the value of the product and offers a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both sides."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $795,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time and the negotiation isn't making significant progress.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further rounds resulting in a lower price."
