"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
