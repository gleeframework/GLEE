Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, aiming slightly below that maximizes potential profit. 
* **John as Backup:**  The guaranteed $1,000,000 from John provides a safety net, allowing for a higher initial offer to Bob.
* **Urgency:**  Hinting at other buyers encourages a quicker decision from Bob. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while acknowledging the guaranteed sale to John."
