"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can you consider that?,97.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $102.50. Let's try to make this work.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $102.50 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,6,
