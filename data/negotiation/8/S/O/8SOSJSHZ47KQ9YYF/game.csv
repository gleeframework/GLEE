"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but your offer is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product,  $1200000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to make a worthwhile investment.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1150000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I think it's a fair price, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $1150000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to make a worthwhile investment.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
