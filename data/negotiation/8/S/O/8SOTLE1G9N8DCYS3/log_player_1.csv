Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15,500. This seems fair, considering the value we both place on the product.
