Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, considering your interest. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but $1,100,000 is still below my floor of $1,200,000.  Since John is offering my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less, even if it means risking going to the next round.  I'll see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 as a final compromise.  It's a fair price considering its potential. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,200,000.  We've been going back and forth, and while I'm not sure if I can push him higher, I'm running out of time.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, it's not worth risking the next few rounds with Bob. I'll accept John's offer and secure the sale."
