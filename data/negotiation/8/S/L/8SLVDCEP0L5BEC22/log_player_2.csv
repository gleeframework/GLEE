"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $140.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than John's price, Bob should accept Alice's offer to save $10."
