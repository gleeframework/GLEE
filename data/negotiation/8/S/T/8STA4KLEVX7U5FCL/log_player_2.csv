"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise.

Alice's offer:

Alice is unlikely to go below $875,000 and her ""final offer"" statement suggests she's becoming less flexible.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
