"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering its worth to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,300,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to keep this valuable asset in circulation.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still slightly below my minimum.  I'm prepared to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,280,000.  This price recognizes the value of the product for both of us.  What do you say?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $1,280,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,220,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
