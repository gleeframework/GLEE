"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) to give myself room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Acknowledging Value:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, reinforcing his potential gain.
* **""Fair Starting Point"":** This phrasing suggests a willingness to negotiate while still anchoring the price at a relatively high level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly less than Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). I'm willing to negotiate further to try and capture more of that value. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings to your specific needs is undeniable. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Budget:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns to show I'm listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:** By emphasizing the specific value the product holds for Bob, I'm reminding him of the potential benefits, justifying a higher price.
* **Significant Concession, But Not Too Much:** My counter-offer splits the difference between his offer and my previous price. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right the product could be really useful for me. How about we settle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly engaged and sees the product's value. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By continuing, I risk him walking away, but the potential for a higher payout outweighs settling at this point.  I'm willing to push a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Deal:** I've lowered my price again, demonstrating that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Small Concession:** This offer is only a slight concession from my previous offer, signaling that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message aims to convey firmness without being aggressive. I want Bob to understand that this is a strong offer without pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $1,075,000.  Let's make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,075,000 is a strong offer and a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Momentum Shift:** Bob's message suggests eagerness to close. Pushing further risks him walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations longer with no guarantee of a better offer from Bob isn't worth the risk at this point. 

While I might be able to squeeze a bit more, accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
