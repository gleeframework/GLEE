"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product! It's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let's start with a price of $1,750,000.  I'm open to negotiation, so let's find a deal that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to negotiate, but I'm only willing to go as high as $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,400,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,550,000. This gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.  I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I can accept while still making a fair profit.  Let's work together to close this deal and avoid needing to go further.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
