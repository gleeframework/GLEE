Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my value. I'm prepared to sell for $1,500,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it represents a good value for you. Let's close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to come closer to my price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my product.  I'm offering you the product for $1,425,000. This is a compromise that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be at $1,450,000.  This represents a substantial compromise from my original position, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to go this high, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has stated that she's unwilling to go lower than $1,450,000, which is still above your maximum budget. With limited rounds left, it's more prudent to secure the product from John for $1,000,000.  You've already successfully negotiated down from $1,750,000 to $1,450,000, which is a good accomplishment.  However, saving $450,000 outweighs the potential of squeezing out a few more dollars from Alice."
