"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's definitely not worth it to accept Alice's offer.  Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, you should reject Alice's offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to start by offering Alice the price I know I can get it for from John. This will make it clear I'm serious about getting a good deal, and we can see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still over my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway and offer $900,000. This is a significant step down from her last offer and still within my budget. Hopefully, this will show her I'm serious about getting a deal but not willing to go above my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's previous offers, it's still significantly more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to offer $950,000,  a bit more than my previous offer but still well below Alice's. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. Hopefully, this will lead to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. While it is getting closer to my ideal price, it's not worth risking further negotiation when I can get the product from John for a guaranteed $800,000.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
