"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and deal aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with an open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  I have 8 rounds left, and there's potential for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Selling to John is a good backup.**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer but showing willingness to compromise by reducing my price.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my proposal. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm still above Bob's desired price, creating pressure for him to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is getting closer, but still low:** While his offer is higher, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We've made progress, and there's still room to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is still a backup:** If the negotiation stalls, I can still secure the higher price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm reiterating the ""fair price"" theme to make my offer more appealing.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While his offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, but there is still potential for Bob to increase his offer. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  If we can't reach an agreement, selling to John guarantees me a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $9,250 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,750 as a final compromise.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm signaling this is my last offer, creating pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Significant Concession:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down to a price closer to Bob's offer.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  Using phrases like ""final compromise"" and ""finalize this deal"" emphasizes the need for a decision.

**Important Considerations:**

* With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to weigh the risk of further negotiation against the potential loss if I sell to John.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely need to accept his next offer or sell to John to avoid losing more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,750, which is $9,375. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to the last two rounds.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer, $9,375 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The chance of Bob increasing his offer in the final round is low. Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly higher.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time and the low potential for improvement in Bob's offers, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed higher price from John."
