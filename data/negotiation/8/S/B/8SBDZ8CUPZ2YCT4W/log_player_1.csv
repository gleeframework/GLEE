"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $900,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my goal. $880,000 is a fair compromise, and I believe Bob is likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $860,000 is a good deal considering we're only halfway through the negotiations. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether."
