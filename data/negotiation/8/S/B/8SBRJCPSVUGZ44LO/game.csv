"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm prepared to go down to $950000.  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a competitive price.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
