"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? ",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $825,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits this product will bring you. Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $850,000.  This is a strong offer, and I need to stay within my limits.  Let me know if this works for you.",850000.0,Bob,6,
