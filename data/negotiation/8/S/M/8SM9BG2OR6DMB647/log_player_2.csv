Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I can do $100, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $102.50? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to her valuation, and I'm getting close to my limit. I'll make one more counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't accept."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and call it $97.50? That's the best I can do."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! I can do $99, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $99.25? It's a small step closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $99 at this point. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a price closer to $100.  Buying from John for $120 guarantees I stay within my budget."
