{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm aiming for a higher price, and $12,000 is still below my desired value. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to try a counteroffer that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product highly."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired value and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer is the best strategy at this point."
