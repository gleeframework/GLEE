Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see the value in. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have strong leverage. Starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for maximum profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique nature"" and ""true worth,"" subtly suggesting the price is justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion. If Bob outright rejects the initial price, you can gauge his willingness to negotiate and adjust accordingly. You always have John as a backup. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer, but still aim higher than $800,000.
* **Market Demand:** If you believe the product could be in high demand beyond Bob and John, an even higher starting price might be justifiable.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging you have a strong position with a guaranteed buyer."
