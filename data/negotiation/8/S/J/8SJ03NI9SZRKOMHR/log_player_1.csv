{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm offering the product to Bob at $100. This is a price that's a good compromise: it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This allows for potential negotiation while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would result in a loss for me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $85?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
