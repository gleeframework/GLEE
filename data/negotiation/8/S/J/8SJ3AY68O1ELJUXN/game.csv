"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but the price point is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer you a compromise at $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product will bring to your business. I'm confident you'll see the long-term benefits and make a great return on investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell we both see the value here. How about splitting the difference - $1,025,000 and we have a deal?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,025,000. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. I'm confident you'll see the long-term returns on investment and make this a worthwhile purchase.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm feeling the pressure with time running short.  This is my final offer - $1,050,000.  It's a fair deal, and we both win. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,075,000. I've already given you a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe this is the best price I can offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $1,075,000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
