"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm confident this product is worth more, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1200000. This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
