"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $110. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to build rapport and make Bob feel more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product without revealing my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price ($100) as possible while still making a profit. I'm starting high and will adjust my offers based on Bob's responses. If the negotiation drags on or I feel like I'm not getting close to a satisfactory price, I will sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $100 is a fair price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John would guarantee me $100, I'm taking a chance with Bob because it's possible we can reach a deal quickly.
* **Risk Assessment:**  There's a risk of a protracted negotiation with Bob, but I'm willing to take that chance for the possibility of a better deal.

**Strategy:**

It's a calculated risk to accept Bob's offer, but it's the most reasonable choice given the information available.  I'm avoiding the potential for a drawn-out negotiation with Bob and securing a decent profit."
