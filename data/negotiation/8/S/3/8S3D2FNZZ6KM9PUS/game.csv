,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would that work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and you're still $15 below my minimum price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $98 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let me know!",108.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still willing to try to make a deal. Since you're so close to my minimum price, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can do $110, but that's it. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,9,
