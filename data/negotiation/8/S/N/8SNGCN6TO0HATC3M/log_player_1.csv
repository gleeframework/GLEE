I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150), hoping to get as close to the value I want as possible.  I'll be willing to negotiate a bit if necessary, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $150 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility, while hopefully still allowing me to earn a good price for the product."
