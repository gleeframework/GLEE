"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try $13,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,750 is close, but I need to get at least $13,900 for it. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13900} 
 
**Reasoning:**  At this point, we're in a delicate stage of the negotiation. 

* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm indicating I'm firm on my price, adding weight to the offer.
* **Small Concession:**  Coming down by $100 shows I'm willing to negotiate but not by much. 
* **Time Pressure:**  As we get closer to the 10-round limit (and the guaranteed $12,000 from John), Bob will feel more pressure to accept a reasonable offer."
