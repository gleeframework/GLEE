"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay to John. There's room for negotiation with Alice, so it's worth rejecting the initial offer and seeing if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's starting with a counteroffer that's $200,000 less than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes Bob's intent to negotiate aggressively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than her initial offer, and still higher than what Bob could get from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price, as Bob still has room to maneuver within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's current offer, but it's also closer to his maximum budget, showing he's serious about reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. Bob is likely to get a better deal if he continues negotiating with Alice, as he still has some rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that is within his maximum budget and only $50,000 higher than what he could get from John. This shows that he is serious about closing the deal with Alice, but he is still trying to get the best possible price. He is also running out of rounds, so he is taking a risk by offering a price closer to his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting further away from Bob's ideal price. He only has a few rounds left, and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing.  It's becoming clear that Alice might be unwilling to meet Bob's price.  At this point, the guaranteed deal with John for $1,200,000 is the best option."
