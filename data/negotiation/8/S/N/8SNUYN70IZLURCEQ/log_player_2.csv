"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, you can likely do better.  You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice only wants $80, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer gives you the chance to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested in the product. I'm willing to go down to $95, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to your target, you still have room to negotiate.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so you can likely get the price down further.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still only willing to go as high as $92.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92}
