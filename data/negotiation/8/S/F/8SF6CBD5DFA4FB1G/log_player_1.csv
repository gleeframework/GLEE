{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more than the minimum $800,000. I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I want to see what Bob's response is first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm not willing to accept such a large discount.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum price.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, his offer is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm not satisfied with this offer yet.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm counteroffering with my minimum price of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer and we can conclude the negotiation.  If he doesn't, I'll sell to John for the same price."
