**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is slowly moving towards my acceptable range. While I could push for more, accepting $17,500 guarantees a sale at a price significantly higher than John's offer.  Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and risks losing Bob altogether."
