,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but it still reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a significant compromise. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and is fair for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,500? I feel like that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $13,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's a number I feel is fair given the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $12,750? This would be my final offer.",12750.0,Bob,8,
