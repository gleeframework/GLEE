"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $95. Let's make this happen!",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you.  $87.50 is getting closer to what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $88.50? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and it would be a good way to close this deal.",88.5,Alice,7,
