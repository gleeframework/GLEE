"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more by rejecting and making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price further to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested, I'm looking to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his $10,000 limit. Since John is willing to sell the product for exactly what Bob is willing to pay, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice. Buying from John guarantees the best deal for Bob."
