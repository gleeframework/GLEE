Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down later.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is above Bob's perceived value ($80) to see if he might be willing to pay more than he initially thinks. 
* **Below John's Offer:** The offer is still below John's offer ($100), ensuring that you have a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room to negotiate and secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and your initial offer ($120). Accepting would result in a considerable loss. 

It's strategically sound to reject this low offer and attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round.  You still have the security of John's offer ($100) if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $60 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still striving for a price closer to your minimum.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The $90 price remains above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for him to potentially counter with a higher offer.
* **Below John's Offer:** It remains below John's offer, ensuring you're not losing out on a guaranteed sale if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $70? That's a fair price, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is trying to negotiate, his offer of $70 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $100.  Continuing to negotiate with him risks prolonging the process without a guarantee of reaching a price you find acceptable. 

You have a solid offer from John for $100. It's in your best interest to take the guaranteed profit rather than risk losing both Bob and John in pursuit of a higher, but uncertain, offer."
