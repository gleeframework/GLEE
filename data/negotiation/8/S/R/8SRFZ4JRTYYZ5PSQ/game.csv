"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $9,800 is closer to what I need, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
