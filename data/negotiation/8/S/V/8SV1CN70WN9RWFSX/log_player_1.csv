I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my ideal price. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a bit higher with Bob before selling to John."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm aware that John is willing to pay $150, I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly better price from Bob. I'll try one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John."

I've reached my limit with Bob.  He's consistently offering $130, and I'm not willing to go any lower. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's time to secure the sale with John for $150. It's a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation."
