"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a little high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the market value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value in the product, I have a strict budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $9,200. This is a good middle ground, considering the market value, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $8,750, but that's really pushing my limit for this.",8750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $9,100.

"Alice, this is a really nice product, but I'm starting to think it's not the right fit for me at this price point.  I can do $8,900, but if we can't agree, I might need to explore other options.",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,900. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product for $9,300. This is a fair price considering the market value, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. However, if we can't agree, I will have to consider selling the product to another buyer.",9300.0,Alice,9,
