"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product.  However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This represents a significant value for both of us, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. To make this work, I'd need to see a price closer to $1,125,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your budget considerations.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
