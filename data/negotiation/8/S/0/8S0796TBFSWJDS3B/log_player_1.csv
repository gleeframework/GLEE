{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the value the product brings to Bob to make the price more palatable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I leave the door open for Bob to counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to secure a price as close to my minimum desired value as possible while keeping the negotiation open and inviting Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Gather information:** Understand Bob's maximum budget and determine how much more I can push for. 
* **Potentially drive up the price:**  By refusing to accept his initial counteroffer, I could motivate Bob to increase his bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and still represents a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I counter with a lower price but provide a clear justification based on the product's value and the previous offer.
* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while maintaining a price that is closer to my minimum goal.
* **Focus on Shared Benefits:** I emphasize the idea of a good deal for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

By making a counter-offer that is still relatively high, I aim to:

* **Test Bob's willingness to compromise:**  See if he's willing to meet me halfway.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  Continue the conversation and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Remain in control of the negotiation without resorting to drastic measures."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further.  By rejecting his offer:

* **Maintaining Leverage:** I demonstrate that I am not desperate and am willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Gathering Information:** It allows me to assess how much further I can push Bob in the next round.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By refusing to accept his offer, I could potentially motivate Bob to increase his offer.

I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing the deal with Bob to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still quite a bit below the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and propose $1,012,500. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing me to make a profit while enabling you to secure this valuable product. I hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:** I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's latest offer ($975,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Final Offer Language:**  I'm framing this as a final offer to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I emphasize the idea of a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and his desire to secure the product.

By making this counter-offer, I'm aiming to:

* **Encourage Acceptance:**  The compromise and final offer language should increase Bob's likelihood of accepting.
* **Secure a Better Price:**  Even though I'm lowering my price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Avoid a Stalemate:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but no more. Can you consider this final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $990,000 is still too far below my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate and compromise, I'm not willing to sell the product for significantly less than what it's worth to me.  

Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees I reach my minimum goal and secures the best possible outcome for me in this scenario. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to a more profitable deal."
