,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $200 is already a very competitive price for this product.  How about we settle at $170? That's a significant price drop and a fair deal for both of us.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $140? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",140.0,Bob,4,
