"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would allow us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not going to go as low as $900,000. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is my final offer on the higher end, and I hope you can meet me here.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $937,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",937500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $937,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about $962,500? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",962500.0,Alice,7,
