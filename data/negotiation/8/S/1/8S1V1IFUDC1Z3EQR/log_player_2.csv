"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and importance to you, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with an offer of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $9,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's a good chance he can get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Bob can always buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, but still leaves room for negotiation.

* **Sets a clear expectation:** Bob is stating his desired price upfront, clearly communicating his position."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. Bob has more rounds to try and get a better price.
* **John is a fallback:**  Bob is comfortable buying from John if necessary, but he wants to see if he can get a better price from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750.  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to move closer to Alice's offer, demonstrating that he wants to reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I propose we set the product price at $8,900. This is a slight increase from your last offer, aiming for a compromise that respects the value of the product while making it more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still too high:** $8,900 is still above Bob's ideal price point and leaves him with little room for profit.
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile:**  There's still some wiggle room for Bob to get a better price. He has 5 more rounds to reach an agreement.
* **John's offer is the safety net:**  Bob can always purchase from John if negotiations fail."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  Bob is clearly stating this is his last offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
