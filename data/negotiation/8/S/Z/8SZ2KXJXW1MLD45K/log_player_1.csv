Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offer of $90 is too low for me, and I'm not confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds. I'd rather guarantee myself a sale at a price that's closer to my target."
