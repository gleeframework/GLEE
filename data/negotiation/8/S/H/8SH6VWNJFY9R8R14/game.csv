"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's try $1,075,000. This is my best and final offer for this round.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
