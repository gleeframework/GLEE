"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below the product's value to you, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget. While I can afford to pay $11,000, I'm still better off negotiating for a lower price or going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I've already made two counteroffers and Alice is clearly unwilling to drop below $10,500.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
