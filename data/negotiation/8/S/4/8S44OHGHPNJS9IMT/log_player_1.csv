"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for me to negotiate down if Bob counters, without sacrificing too much profit. 
* **Setting the tone:** My message is friendly but firm, suggesting that I'm confident in the price and value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it's still above my minimum of $120, so there's potential for a better deal. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Strategic negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to negotiate further. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $135?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer immediately, demonstrating that I value the product and won't settle for any price.
* **Splitting the difference:** This approach is fair and shows willingness to compromise, making it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $135 is still a good price for me, keeping my profits above my minimum while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Can you meet me at $132? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is just $3 below my initial offer and only $2 above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating, especially since I can sell to John for $120.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a profitable price while limiting the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
