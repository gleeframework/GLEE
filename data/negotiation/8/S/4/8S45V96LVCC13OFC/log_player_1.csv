Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high value without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests a willingness to discuss the price further, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that could be attractive if he's convinced of the product's value."
