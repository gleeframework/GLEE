Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting with a significantly higher price ($1,800,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:**  This high price acts as an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of the product's value.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. Alice can afford to be more ambitious in her offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  In a real-world scenario, Alice might benefit from a more nuanced approach with multiple offers and counter-offers."
