Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. My asking price is $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than Bob's estimated value, but still above my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while also ensuring I'm maximizing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
I'm offering $135. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has repeatedly offered $130.  Continuing to negotiate is likely to result in a lower price or even a sale to John at a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent profit without risking a worse outcome."
