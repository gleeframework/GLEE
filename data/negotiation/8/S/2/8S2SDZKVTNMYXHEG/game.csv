"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do like the product, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow me to sell the product without losing too much.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
