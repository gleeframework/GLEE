"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her starting price is already at $1,100,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm open to further discussion, let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,025,000?  This reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still too high. It's closer to your maximum price of $1,200,000, but you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
