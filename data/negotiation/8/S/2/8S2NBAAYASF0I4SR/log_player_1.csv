Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your potential gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. This offer represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This considers both our positions and could finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $750,000 is a tempting offer, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob clearly sees the value in the product and is willing to move significantly from his initial offer.  I'll hold firm for now to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'll offer it for $875,000.  This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering its value."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  A drop to $875,000 keeps us above our minimum but shows flexibility.  This price point aims to entice Bob while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It seems like we both want to make a deal happen. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a strong offer considering the current market and ensures you get a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. While we could push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting $800,000 guarantees a strong return and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
