Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we compromise at $1,150,000? This price is closer to my initial offer, and it reflects the value I see in the product. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to get a significant deal. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer."
