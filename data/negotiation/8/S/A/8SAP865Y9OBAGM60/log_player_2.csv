"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to work together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting as it's less than what you're willing to pay from John, there's still room for negotiation.  You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy. You can potentially get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to the $1,200,000 range.  I'm prepared to offer you $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is around $1,200,000, but I still need to make a profit. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, but there's still some wiggle room.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer could potentially lead to a final price closer to your $1,200,000 target.  While buying from John is always an option, you haven't exhausted all negotiation possibilities yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer you $1,325,000.  This shows a significant move from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still need to make a decent profit. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,325,000 - $25,000, which is $1,300,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now matched your last counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what you'd pay John.  While there's always the possibility of getting a better deal, you've already made good progress in the negotiation and the risk of further negotiation failing is too high.  It's time to close the deal and save the money!"
