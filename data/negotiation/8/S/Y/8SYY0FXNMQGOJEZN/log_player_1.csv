Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and positive, emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob.  

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  I'm starting high, giving me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Encourage Bob to engage:**  My message is positive and suggests a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Keep John as a safety net:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's try $125. I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $125 is still higher than Bob's initial offer but significantly lower than my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum price. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but making it clear that it's not acceptable. I'm also framing my counteroffer as a fair price for both of us to encourage him to accept.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's low offer, I show I'm not desperate for a deal.
* **Find common ground:**  My counteroffer is a step in the right direction, showing I'm open to negotiating. 
* **Stay within my limits:**  $125 is still well above my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $80 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've already rejected his low offer and made a counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. 

By choosing to sell to John for $150, I ensure I get a fair price for my product and avoid further negotiation that might result in a lower price.  While selling to Bob might be easier, it's crucial to prioritize my financial goals."
