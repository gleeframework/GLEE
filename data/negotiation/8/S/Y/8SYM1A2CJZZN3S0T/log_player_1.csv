""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be highly beneficial to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price increases potential profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 provides leverage. 

By offering the product at $1,400,000, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on it while still staying above her minimum acceptable price."
