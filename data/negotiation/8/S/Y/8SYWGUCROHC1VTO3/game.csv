"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, I'm aiming to secure a price closer to $800,000 to make this deal truly work for me.  I believe there's room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still convinced that the product's value to you is higher than what you're willing to pay. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's true worth, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  This price reflects the value to me, while allowing you to make a strong profit.  What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, while also being a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
