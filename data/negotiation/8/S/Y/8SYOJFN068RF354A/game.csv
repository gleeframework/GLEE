"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
