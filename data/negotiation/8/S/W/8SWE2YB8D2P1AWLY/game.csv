"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest in it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you be open to that?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $825,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my initial expectations.",825000.0,Alice,5,
