"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $1,500,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. However, based on my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1,500,000. Could we perhaps aim for $1,450,000 as a compromise?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
