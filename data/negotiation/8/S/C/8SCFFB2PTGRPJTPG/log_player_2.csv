"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for both of us. Given its significance and the unique benefits it offers, I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies our respective interests. Considering its worth to you, I propose a purchase price of $950,000. This offer not only reflects the product's true value but also provides a reasonable profit margin for me. I look forward to discussing this further and hope to hear your thoughts soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This means you save $250,000.
* **John's offer is your fallback.**  While you'd prefer to save more, John's offer provides a guaranteed way to get the product if you reject Alice. 

It's always smart to negotiate, but in this case, Alice's offer is a good deal that allows you to save significantly."
