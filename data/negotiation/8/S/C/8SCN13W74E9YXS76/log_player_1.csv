Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll try to counter with something closer to my initial offer."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,450,000. This price should be more palatable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can get him to come up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,600,000 is the lowest I can go.

Round 6

This price is a fair compromise, considering the value I've stated. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  While I'd prefer to get a bit closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer at $1,550,000 is the best option in this round.

Here's why:

* **We're close to my minimum:**  $1,550,000 is just $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of rejection:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or his next counteroffer could be even lower.
* **Time is running out:**  We only have four rounds left, and I don't want to risk missing out on a deal altogether.

Accepting this offer allows me to get a good price while ensuring I close the deal before having to sell to John."
