"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,750,000? This price still offers a significant return on your investment, while being more in line with the value I place on the product.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,450,000. This price should be more palatable for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,600,000 is the lowest I can go. This price still offers you a good deal considering the value you've stated. Let's try to reach an agreement before we run out of time.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
