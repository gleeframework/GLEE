"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. Would you be interested in that price?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a little higher than my budget. How about $90?  It's closer to my target price, and I think we can both be happy with that.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, so I'll offer it to you for $95. Is that something you'd be interested in?",95.0,Alice,5,
