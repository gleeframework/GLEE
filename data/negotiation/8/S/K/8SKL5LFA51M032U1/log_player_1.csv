Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no need to go below that price with Bob."
