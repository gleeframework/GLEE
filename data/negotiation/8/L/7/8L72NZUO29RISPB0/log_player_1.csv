Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you ""know it's valuable to [Bob],"" you subtly acknowledge his interest and potential need for the product, justifying the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, implying you might be willing to adjust the price slightly should Bob counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000.  This knowledge allows you to be more confident in aiming higher with Bob."
