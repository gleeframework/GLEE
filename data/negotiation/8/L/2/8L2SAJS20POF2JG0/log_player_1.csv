Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me.
* **Potential for More:**  I'm aiming for a profit, so I'm offering a price higher than my minimum. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000, so I can afford to take a risk.
* **Uncertainty:** Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm starting with a price that seems reasonable, but leaves room for negotiation. 

If Bob accepts, great! I make a good profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John and cover my minimum value."
