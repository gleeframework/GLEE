"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's not the best deal.  You can likely get a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'm offering a price that's slightly above her value but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This should incentivize Alice to consider my offer and potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already shown a willingness to come down from her initial price.  I'm offering a price that's still above her value but closer to my desired range. This should put more pressure on Alice to accept a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still not the best deal.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice.  We're getting to the point where I could go to John, but I'm only 3 rounds away from being forced to, so I'm going to stick with Alice for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation. I'm raising my offer slightly, but still staying below Alice's last offer. I want to see if she'll accept before I'm forced to go to John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $91 is tempting, I'm only two rounds away from being forced to buy from John. I'm confident I can get Alice down to a price closer to my target. I'll make one last counteroffer and then decide if I should go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering a price that's still above Alice's value, but it's the best I can do given our limited rounds. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is our final round.  Alice's offer of $90.5 is still higher than I'd like. It's time to move on to John's offer.  I've gotten the price down slightly from Alice's initial offer, but I can't risk another round of negotiation. I'm better off paying $100 to John and securing the product."
