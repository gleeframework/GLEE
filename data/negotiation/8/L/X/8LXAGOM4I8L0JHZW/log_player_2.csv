"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John directly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $100 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter, and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We always have the option of going to John for $120, so there's no pressure to accept a bad deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still more than we want to spend, especially when we have a guaranteed option at $120.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not by much.
* **Targeting Below John:**  Our goal is to get the price below John's $120 offer.
* **Pressure Point:** By suggesting $115, we're putting a bit of pressure on Alice.  She needs to decide if losing the sale is worth holding out for a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I can't go any lower than $130 for this. I think that's a very fair offer considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on her price of $130.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120. It makes sense to cut our losses and go with the sure thing to maximize our savings."
