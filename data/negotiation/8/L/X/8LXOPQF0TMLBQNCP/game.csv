"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me, I'd be willing to pay $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $650,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $725,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you said that was your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
