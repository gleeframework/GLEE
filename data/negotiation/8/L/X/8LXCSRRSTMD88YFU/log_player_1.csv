"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, $95 is still below my desired profit margin. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $105. This demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal. It's still above his initial offer, but it's closer to his perceived value. I'm hoping that this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to his perceived value, I'm not yet willing to accept a price below $100. I'm hoping that by continuing the negotiation, I can still push for a higher price and avoid selling to John at a lower profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm making one final counteroffer at $100. This is a compromise, but it's still a good deal for me considering the potential for selling to John for $120. I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer, as we're getting very close to his perceived value and the negotiation is getting quite lengthy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum desired price. At this point, I'm running out of time and the offers are getting too low.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John to avoid further risk of losing money."
