"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $9500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10250. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Alice,5,
