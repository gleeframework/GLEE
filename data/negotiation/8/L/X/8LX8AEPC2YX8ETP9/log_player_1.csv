Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle. While $7,500 is still a decent price, it's significantly below my minimum asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $7,000 is too low for me, and I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $7,000 is just too far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
