"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $7000 is just too far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
