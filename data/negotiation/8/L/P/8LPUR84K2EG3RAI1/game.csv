"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make a profit. I'll give you a slight discount, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
