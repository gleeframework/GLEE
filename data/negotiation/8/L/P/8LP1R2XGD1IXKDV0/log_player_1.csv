"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This allows me to see if he's truly interested and gauge how much he's willing to pay. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $12,000.  While $9,500 is better than his initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer while still keeping me above my minimum value.  I believe this price is fair and gives Bob an opportunity to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $12,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering $10,000. This is a further compromise, bringing my price down again. However, I'm still above my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a good deal and is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,200 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, and I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm offering $9,750. This is a significant compromise on my end and getting closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if he rejects it, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  We're running out of rounds, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
