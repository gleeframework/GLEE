"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. I'm getting closer to a number I can agree to. How about $1,025,000? I think that represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
