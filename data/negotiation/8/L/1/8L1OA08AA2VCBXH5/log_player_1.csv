Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a fair distance from my minimum of $80 and allows room for negotiation.  It's also a good price for Bob, as it's significantly less than the $120 he values it at. This should hopefully lead to a quick and amicable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I can still try to get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested! I understand $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me Alice, but I'm trying to keep it closer to $85.  How about $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I think there's a chance he won't budge further. It's better to accept his offer of $88 than to risk another round of counteroffers that might end with me having to sell to John for $80."
