"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm already coming down from my initial offer of $12,000.",8200.0,Alice,5,
