{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum as possible ($150) while still being attractive to Bob.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'll be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low or if the negotiation drags on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to buy the product for $150, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. Would you consider $135? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $135 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132 is still a bit below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $150, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and limits potential losses."
