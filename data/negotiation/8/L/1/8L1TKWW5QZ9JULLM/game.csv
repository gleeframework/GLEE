"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. Would you consider $135? That's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $135 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",132.0,Bob,4,
