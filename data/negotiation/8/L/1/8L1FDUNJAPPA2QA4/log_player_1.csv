Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I am aiming for a price as close to Bob's valuation as possible, but I also need to ensure I get more than John's offer.  I believe this initial offer is a good balance, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It is below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000 and significantly below my initial offer. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, but I also want to continue the negotiation. A counteroffer will allow me to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a value significantly higher than John's offer. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
