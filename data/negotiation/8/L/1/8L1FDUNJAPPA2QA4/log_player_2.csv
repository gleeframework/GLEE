You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price, but also wants to avoid risking losing the product to John. A counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point - it's a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  It's still a good deal for Bob, saving him $100,000.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether or having to accept an even higher price if Alice is unwilling to budge further.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase and a good savings."
