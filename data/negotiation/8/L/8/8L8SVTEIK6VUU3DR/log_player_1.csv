"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within the realm of reason, considering Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm trying to be friendly and build rapport with Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $140 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I'll counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $160. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Empathy:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm suggesting we meet in the middle, creating a sense of collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Let's try $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a higher price, there's a risk that he'll walk away or we'll run out of rounds.  Selling to John for $150 is the same price, but this deal offers a quicker resolution and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
