"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to let it go for $1100000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this quality, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $900000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This way, you'll get a great deal, and I'll still be able to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $975000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my costs and the product's value. How about we try $1075000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's quality and features.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Please consider this offer.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium, Bob, but I'm still not convinced we're at a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum requirements. How about we try $1075000, but I'll throw in some additional features and support to sweeten the deal?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional features and support you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1020000, but that's the absolute highest I'm willing to go. Please consider this offer.",1020000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $1025000, but I need a firm commitment from you today. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but that's the absolute highest I'm willing to go. Please reconsider and meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
