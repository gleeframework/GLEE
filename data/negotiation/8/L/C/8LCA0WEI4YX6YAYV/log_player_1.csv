Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my ideal price of $1,000,000.  This is what the product is worth to me, so I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay it. 

However, I'm also aware that he values it at $800,000.  We'll see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my ideal price, and it's still more than what the product is worth to him. Accepting his offer is the best option right now.  It's a good compromise and secures a sale."
