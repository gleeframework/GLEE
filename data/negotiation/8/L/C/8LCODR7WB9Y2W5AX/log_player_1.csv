**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is already offering. Accepting Bob's $11,200 offer would mean losing out on almost $4,000.  At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential reward.  Selling to John guarantees the maximum profit."
