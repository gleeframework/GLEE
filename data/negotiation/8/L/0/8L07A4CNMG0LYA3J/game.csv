"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product, considering its value to me is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the potential profit I can make from it. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum.  This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects its true value while still allowing for a good profit margin for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $750,000? This would still allow me to make a profit while also being a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,4,
