Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can go up to $750,000, but that's really stretching my budget.  It's a fair offer considering your asking price is still significantly above my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. While he's incrementally increasing his offer, we're still in a position to negotiate further. We're closer to John's offer than Bob's, so continuing the negotiation is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving up, but the gap between our positions is still too wide. I'm willing to consider $1,150,000 this round, but that's a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're continuing to lower our price in smaller increments to signal that we're getting closer to our limit. This keeps the pressure on Bob to significantly raise his offer if he wants to close the deal.  We're aiming for a price above $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a critical point in our negotiation.  I'm prepared to offer $780,000.  This is a very strong offer, and I need to see some real movement on your side to justify going any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is still too low, and his increments are very small. He's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to our $1,200,000 minimum. We risk wasting more time and potentially ending up with a much lower offer if we continue. Selling to John guarantees us our desired price with no further negotiation."
