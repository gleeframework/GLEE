"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $90.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. That's a fair price, considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $85 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $92. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first offer, it's still higher than your ideal price. You are willing to pay $85, and John is selling for $100.  Therefore, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get the product for $87.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $87. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $89. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is very close to your target price of $87. It's also a better price than what John is offering.  It's time to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
