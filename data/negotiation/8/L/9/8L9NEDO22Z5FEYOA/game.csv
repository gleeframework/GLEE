"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it still reflects the product's worth.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognize your interest. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To be fair to us both, I'm proposing $1,350,000.  This acknowledges your perspective while still reflecting the true value of what I'm offering.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm thinking $1,050,000 is a more comfortable price for me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but we're getting close to the point where this becomes unfeasible for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000, but this is my absolute limit.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering the value this product provides.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,275,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. I'd like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
