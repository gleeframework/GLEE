Bob's offer:

I'd like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is below my desired price, it's significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000.  

* **Continuing negotiations is risky:** Bob seems anchored at a price point much lower than my initial offers. There's a chance we won't reach a significantly better agreement within the remaining rounds.
* **Time value of money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that can be reinvested or utilized elsewhere.

Taking a $50,000 profit over a guaranteed sale is a strategically sound choice in this scenario."
