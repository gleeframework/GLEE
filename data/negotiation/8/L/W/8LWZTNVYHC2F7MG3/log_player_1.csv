Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $11,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without immediately hitting my minimum value.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone can help build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $9,500 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob.  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is the fallback:** While selling to John for $12,000 is a good option, I want to see if I can get closer to that price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still room for him to increase his offer. I want to see if I can push him further.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  If I don't get a better offer from Bob, selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome. However, I'm hoping to squeeze out a little more profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm offering another compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm highlighting that this price is fair for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Focus on the benefit:** I'm reminding Bob that accepting my offer will allow him to get the product he wants."
