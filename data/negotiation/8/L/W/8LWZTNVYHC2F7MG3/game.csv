"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want.",10000.0,Alice,5,
