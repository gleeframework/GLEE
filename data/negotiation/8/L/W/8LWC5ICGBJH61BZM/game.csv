"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe the product's value to you would be worth the extra $1,000. What are your thoughts?",12500.0,Alice,3,
