"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum acceptable value ($120). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately rejecting Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Selling to John:**  While $120 is my floor, I'm not yet ready to sell to John. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $115 to $105. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $105 is a midpoint between Bob's offer of $85 and my previous offer of $115.
* **Positive Framing:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Floor:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, indicating there might be a price we can both agree on. 
* **Strategic Hold:**  Selling to John for $120 is tempting, but I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's right at my floor ($100), which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Final Push:**  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the fairness of the price and the value of the product."
