Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but I need to see a more serious commitment from your side. Would you consider $1,400,000?

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get closer to my target price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving towards a more acceptable price point."

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about reaching a deal, and I appreciate that. However, the value of this product is firmly above $900,000. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to find a solution. What are your thoughts on this?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still too high for me, even though it's a significant compromise on her part.  I'm committed to getting a better price.  I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand the value of this product, $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increasingly strong offers.  To demonstrate my own commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still over my budget, and with only a few rounds left, the likelihood of getting her to go any lower seems slim.  I'm confident that I can secure a more favorable deal with John, who's already willing to sell me the product for $800,000. It's time to move on and avoid risking further negotiations that might not yield a better outcome."
