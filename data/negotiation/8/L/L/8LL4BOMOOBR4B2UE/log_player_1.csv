Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent profit, I'm still within my range of acceptable profit and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $14,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate further."
