Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing me to get a good price and you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to give me a good profit but low enough that Bob is likely to consider it. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating. However, I have the option to sell to John at any time if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,050,000. This allows me to stay within my budget while still acquiring a valuable asset. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation but is closer to my value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your revised offer, I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,075,000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value you place on the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still lower than what I would ideally like, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential delays.  Selling to John would yield a lower profit, so this deal is the better option."
