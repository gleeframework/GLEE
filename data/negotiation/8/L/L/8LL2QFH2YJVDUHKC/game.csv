"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing me to get a good price and you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,050,000. This allows me to stay within my budget while still acquiring a valuable asset. I look forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation but is closer to my value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your revised offer, I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,075,000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value you place on the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
