"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, while also ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that balances the value of the product with the price I'm willing to pay.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1050000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
