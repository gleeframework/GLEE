"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1250000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it still reflects the value of this exceptional product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000. However, I'm still a bit above that number. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000.
