Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with my highest possible price.  While Bob is only willing to pay $1,000,000, I'm going to try to push him to the limit. This gives me the best chance of getting a higher price. If he rejects, we'll see how much he's willing to negotiate.  However, if he accepts, I've made a good deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him higher. There's still a chance he might be willing to pay more to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to reduce my price slightly to $1,400,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him.  This might encourage him to compromise and get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price. It's time to secure the deal with John and ensure I get my desired value."
