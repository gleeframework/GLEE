"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is lower than John's price, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation."
