"I understand that $60 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $55. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",55.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $47.50, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $52.50. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",52.5,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, Bob, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer you the product for $53. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",53.0,Alice,7,
