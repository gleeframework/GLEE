"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $120, and I'd like to save some money on this purchase.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. However, due to the costs associated with production and distribution, I am unable to accept $100 for the product. My counteroffer is $110, which I believe strikes a good balance between the value the product holds for you and the expenses involved. I look forward to your response.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding of the production and distribution costs, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
