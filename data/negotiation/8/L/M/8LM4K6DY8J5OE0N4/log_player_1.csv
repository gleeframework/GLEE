Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum ($10,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there is potential for a win-win situation.  I'll be prepared to counter if necessary, but ultimately I'm willing to walk away with the $10,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still confident we can reach a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. I understand your position, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $12,000?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm hoping to close the gap with this counteroffer. It's still significantly higher than what I'd get from John, and it's closer to Bob's original offer.  If he still refuses, I might be forced to accept his offer or take John's deal."
