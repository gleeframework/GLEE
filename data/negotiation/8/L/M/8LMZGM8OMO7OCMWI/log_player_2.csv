# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
