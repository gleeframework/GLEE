Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $11,000?** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's valuation, giving me a profit, but also lower than John's valuation, ensuring I don't lose out on a better deal. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm taking into account both Bob's value and my own minimum valuation.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit to secure a sale, but I won't go below $11,000 because that would be less profitable than selling to John."
