,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm looking for closer to $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $980,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $990,000. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. ",990000.0,Alice,7,
