"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still lower than my minimum threshold. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm looking for closer to $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer,  $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $980,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm only a few rounds away from selling to John for $1,000,000, so I want to make sure I'm getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $980,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $990,000. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. "", ""product_price"": 990000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $990,000. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000, which is the closest I can get to your target without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're only two rounds away from the deadline, and I'm not confident I'll be able to secure a price higher than $1,000,000 with Bob. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $1,000,000, which meets my minimum requirement and saves me time."
