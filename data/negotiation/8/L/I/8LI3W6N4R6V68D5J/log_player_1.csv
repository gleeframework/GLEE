"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable, but  $1,800,000 is not within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider coming down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects the immense value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,500,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This offer represents a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budgetary limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. It exceeds his perceived value and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
