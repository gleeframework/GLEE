Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is higher than Bob's value of the product but lower than your minimum acceptable price. It allows room for negotiation and potentially getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I need to get at least $135 for it.  Let's meet in the middle. Would you be willing to pay $135?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $135 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $132.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $132 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. I'll sell to John and ensure I get my minimum desired price."
