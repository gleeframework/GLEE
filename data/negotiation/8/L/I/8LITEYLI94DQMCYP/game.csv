"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $950,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on it. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price allows for some flexibility while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
