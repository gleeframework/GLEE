"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you the product for $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
