Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""Given its value..."") to justify the high starting price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion (""What are your thoughts?"") rather than issuing an ultimatum. 

By offering the product at $19,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, Alice secures a profit significantly higher than her fallback option (John).
2. **Leave Room for Bargaining:**  If Bob counters, Alice can potentially still negotiate a price higher than $15,000. 
3. **Maintain the Option of John:** If Bob outright rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John at her minimum price."
