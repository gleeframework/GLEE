"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Could you meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
