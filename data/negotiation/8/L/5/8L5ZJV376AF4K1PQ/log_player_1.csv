Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. However, offering the product at $150 or slightly below might make Bob hesitant, as it leaves him with no perceived gain.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and implies a discount while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer guarantees Alice at least $150. Therefore, the offer to Bob needs to be enticing enough for him to choose it over no deal.

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the deal."
