Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Maximizes your potential profit:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, giving you room to earn more. 
* **Sets a strong opening position:** It shows you're confident in the product's worth. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is your minimum, it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price. Bob is clearly interested, so there's potential for a deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500 as a counteroffer. This is:

* **A compromise:**  It's a move from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Appealing to Bob:** It shows I'm flexible while still attempting to maximize my profit. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** If necessary, I can adjust this price again based on Bob's response."
