Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $100, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $125 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price above our minimum ($150).
* **Considering the Alternative:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. This knowledge gives us leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your negotiation style and how much you want to ensure a sale to Bob, you could adjust the initial offer."
