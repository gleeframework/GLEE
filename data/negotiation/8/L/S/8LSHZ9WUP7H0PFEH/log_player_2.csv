"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $115 is a bit too close to your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It's a significant decrease from Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to meet in the middle at $110.  This is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer. It's best to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
