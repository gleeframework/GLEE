"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $10,500? I'm serious about buying, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  How about $10,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at that price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
