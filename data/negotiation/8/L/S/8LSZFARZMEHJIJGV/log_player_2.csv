As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at $925,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $920,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $915,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is offering a price well below your ""buy from John"" price. While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will move much more and you risk her sticking to the $920,000. This offer is a good compromise."
