Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but still incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price significantly lower than her own valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this initial offer is high, it allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at her desired price.

By starting at $1,150,000, Alice leaves room to potentially lower the price slightly during negotiation while still making a significant profit."
