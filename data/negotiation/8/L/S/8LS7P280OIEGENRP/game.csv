"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, I'm not quite comfortable with $120.  How about we meet in the middle at $123?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",123.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $118?",118.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $120. That would still be a great price for you, and it would be a fair deal for me.",120.0,Alice,5,
