"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $500,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

Alice is coming down, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to counteroffer strategically."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $700,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm, but this is getting close. I'll make one more counteroffer,  but I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $625,000. It's a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal happen. If you're not able to accept, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 625000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to accept $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is clearly not budging further, and I'm not willing to go above $625,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. While I could have saved more, getting the product for $1,000,000 is better than potentially ending up with nothing after 10 rounds."
