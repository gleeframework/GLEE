Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this careful consideration, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $880,000 is too high. I would like to propose $850,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects the value of your item while staying within my budget.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $800,000, and it's likely I won't get a higher offer from Bob."
