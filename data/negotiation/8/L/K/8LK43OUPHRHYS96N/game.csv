"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I'm considering. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value it would bring to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $1,800,000 is still more than I had in mind. I could potentially stretch my budget to $700,000.  This is my final offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
