It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the gains are becoming smaller with each round. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is a round I can't spend finding another potential buyer who might be willing to pay even more.
* **Strong Offer:** $1,230,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.

While holding out for a potential $1,250,000 is tempting, it's not worth risking the deal for such a relatively small gain at this point."
