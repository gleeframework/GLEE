Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to $120 as possible, which is the price John will pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is my starting point, I'm open to Bob negotiating a slightly lower price (though not below my $120 minimum). 
* **Creating Urgency:** By presenting it as a ""special price,"" I subtly encourage Bob to act quickly. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
