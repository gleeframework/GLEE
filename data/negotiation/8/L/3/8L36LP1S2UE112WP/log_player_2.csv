# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  I understand it might be a significant investment, but I believe it will be a wise one for your business.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss the details further.
