Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my desired value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** A positive and friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's worth, making Bob consider the potential benefit of acquiring it.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll always have the option of selling to John for $10,000 as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I can sell to John for $10,000,  I'm not desperate. I believe I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Bob acknowledges the product's value, opening the door for further negotiation. I can try to meet him halfway.
* **Avoid immediate loss:** Accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter-offer with a price closer to my initial $12,000, potentially around $11,000.
* I'll emphasize the product's value and explain why it's worth more than $10,000. 
* I'll remain open to negotiation but also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $11,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and it gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility by meeting Bob halfway.  
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's worth and the discount it offers. 
* **Fairness:** I present the price as a win-win situation, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a solid price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept his offer if he doesn't budge.
* I'll continue to keep John's offer as a backup plan in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** Bob's offer is only $500 more than John's offer.  This is a small increase, but it represents a gain for me.
* **Potential for future negotiation:** Even if I sell to Bob at $10,500, there's a chance we might be able to negotiate a higher price in the future if Bob ends up valuing the product more than he initially thought.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures a sale at a reasonable price.  If I counter-offer again, there's a chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's $10,000 offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.
* If possible, I'll attempt to build a good relationship with Bob in case we can work together in the future."
