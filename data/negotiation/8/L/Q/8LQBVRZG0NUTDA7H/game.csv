"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it will be just as valuable to you. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's high quality and potential.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I see the value in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and its potential for your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but this is my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
