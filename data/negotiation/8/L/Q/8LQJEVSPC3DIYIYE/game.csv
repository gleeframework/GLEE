"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $1250000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $1400000. This is the highest I'm willing to go at this point, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
