"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to me, so Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still too high. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further.  While I could buy from John for $10,000, there's still room for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal. It also leaves room for her to compromise a bit to get closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my target price of $10,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better deal.  While I could buy from John for $10,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm now offering Alice my target price of $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's the most I'm willing to pay. If Alice accepts, we can close the deal. If she rejects, I will buy from John."
