"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a decent margin, but it's still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering the product is worth $10,000 to him. I'm hopeful he'll accept, but I'm ready to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold. I believe it's a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm sticking to my guns and offering $10,500. This is only $500 above my minimum and shows I'm flexible, but I'm not willing to drop further. We're approaching the halfway point in our negotiations, and I'm hopeful Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.
