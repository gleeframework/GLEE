"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic tone sets the stage for a collaborative negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him can encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are still 8 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a better price. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push him to offer a higher price or give me a chance to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  However,  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to both get a good outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $13,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable to him and emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect.
* **Negotiation Tone:** I'm using a friendly and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob has moved slightly closer to my minimum price, his offer of $12,500 is still below my acceptable threshold.
* **Opportunity to Increase:**  With six rounds remaining, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, but it might be worth continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $13,250? This way, we can both get a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while keeping some room for negotiation.
* **Positive Language:**  Using positive language and phrases like ""good deal"" reinforces the idea that this is a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding ""Let's make this happen!"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While Bob has increased his offer slightly, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Time:** With only four rounds left, the pressure is mounting to secure a decent price. However, I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 as a backup option gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll need to be firm and persuasive in my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the urgency of closing the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand you have a budget, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  How about $13,000? This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm calling this my final offer to create a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground price, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and justifying the price.
* **Clear and Direct:** I'm using clear and direct language to make my intentions clear."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $12500 is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  Only two rounds remain, and there's a high chance that Bob will not budge from his final offer of $12,500.
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a possibility of getting a higher price from Bob in the next round, the risk of losing the deal and ending up with nothing outweighs the potential reward.

**Conclusion:**  It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed profit from John and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
