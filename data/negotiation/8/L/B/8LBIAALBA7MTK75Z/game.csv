"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation. However, I need to make a profit, and $950000 is still below my minimum threshold.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1075000, and you've offered $990000, which is still below my minimum price. I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and dedicated support for the product, which is worth an additional $50000. This brings the total value to $1040000. I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price, but I need a commitment from you today.",1040000.0,Alice,9,
