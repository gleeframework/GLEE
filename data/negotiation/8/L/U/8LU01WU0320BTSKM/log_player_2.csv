"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you compared to your original price and offers me a fair value."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before seriously considering John's offer.  I want to see if I can get Alice down to a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still above my budget with $1,050,000.  However, I believe we're close to a deal.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a compromise that allows us both to save a significant amount of money.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a slight discount from my original price, but I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above my budget, and we're only halfway through the negotiations.  At this point, it's likely that we'll continue to go back and forth with small adjustments to the price.  I'm not confident that I can get Alice down to my desired price of $1,000,000 or less within the remaining rounds. Therefore, I'm going to take the guaranteed price from John and purchase the product from him."
