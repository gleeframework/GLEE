"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you compared to your original price and offers me a fair value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
