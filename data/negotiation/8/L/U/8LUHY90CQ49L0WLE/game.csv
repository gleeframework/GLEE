"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  While $18,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for me. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  Could you do $16,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I could manage $14,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,6,
