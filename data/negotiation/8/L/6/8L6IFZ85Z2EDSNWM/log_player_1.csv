Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but there's still a good chance of settling above the $800,000 fallback.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob's valuation, he's unlikely to reveal it. Alice needs to gauge his interest and willingness to pay during the negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive starting price might be considered."
