"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message clearly indicates I'm open to discussing the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving the door open for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly below my minimum desired value ($15,000) and even below what I offered him in the previous round. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Selling to John at $15,000 is a safe option, but I want to explore if a better deal can be made with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to bridge the gap and keep the negotiation moving forward."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the negotiation feel more balanced. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect and the ""great deal"" for Bob. This emphasizes the value of the product and keeps the conversation positive. 
* **Encouraging action:** My message is clear and concise, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially agree to the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a middle ground price, I aim to keep Bob engaged and move closer to a mutually agreeable deal. This strategy also keeps the negotiation dynamic, potentially leading to a successful outcome within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired value ($15,000).  
* **Closing the gap:**  However, Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, which gives me hope for a successful negotiation. 
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:**  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob, especially since we're down to only 6 rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to bridge the remaining gap and see if we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  While $9,750 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference again - how about $10,125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can make this work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm offering a price that is again halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous one. This shows ongoing flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting the middle ground:**  I explicitly state that the price is ""fair for both of us"" to emphasize that it's a mutually beneficial compromise.
* **Building urgency:** I mention that this is the time to ""make this work"" to subtly emphasize the limited rounds remaining.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that is closer to Bob's desired price, I aim to increase the probability of him accepting the offer. This approach also maintains the momentum of the negotiation and keeps the conversation positive and constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** Bob's offer, while an improvement, is still well below my minimum desired value of $15,000. Selling at this price would be a significant loss for me.
* **Closing the gap:**  However, the gap is getting smaller with each round, indicating that we're nearing a possible agreement.
* **Time pressure:** We have only four rounds remaining. The risk of losing out to John is increasing.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer. I aim to bridge the gap, but also make it clear that my margin for negotiation is limited due to the dwindling rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,900 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $10,012? This is a small compromise for both of us, and we can finalize this deal within the remaining rounds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10012}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm offering a price that's almost halfway between my previous offer ($10,125) and Bob's current offer ($9,900). This shows that I'm actively trying to find common ground.
* **Highlighting time pressure:** I emphasize that we can ""finalize this deal within the remaining rounds"" to subtly increase the urgency of reaching an agreement.
* **Small compromise:** I frame the offer as a ""small compromise"" to make it more appealing and minimize the perceived distance between our positions.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I'm aiming to push for a quick deal. By offering a price closer to Bob's, I hope to secure a sale before time runs out and I have to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my desired value and even below the minimum I set for myself. 
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  John's offer of $15,000 ensures a substantial profit and guarantees a sale.

**Conclusion:**

Although I'd like to close a deal with Bob, the remaining time and the significant difference in our desired prices make selling to John the most rational decision.  It guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob."
