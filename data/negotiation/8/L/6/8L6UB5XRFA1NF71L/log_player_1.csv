Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this. However, $800,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $600,000. This price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying. What do you think?
