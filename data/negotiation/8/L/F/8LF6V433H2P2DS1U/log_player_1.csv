Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the deal.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider, given the product's worth to him."
