"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,750,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
