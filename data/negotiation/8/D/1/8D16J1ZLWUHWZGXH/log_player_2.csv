"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly less than what you would pay John ($1,500,000). Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000, making it the most financially beneficial option."
