Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns on investment. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

While a higher price is ideal, Bob is signaling he's nearing his limit. Accepting $1,850,000 secures a substantial profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
