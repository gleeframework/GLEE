"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product at a price of $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 9 rounds left and can still try to get a better price from Bob, or I can always sell to John for $1,200,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the deal and avoid any potential risk of Bob rejecting further counteroffers or me needing to sell to John."
