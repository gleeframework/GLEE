"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's no reason to accept such a high price when you have a guaranteed alternative with John. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,900,000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price point makes it a very attractive acquisition for you.
