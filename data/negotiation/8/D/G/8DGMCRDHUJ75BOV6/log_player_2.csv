"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $800,000. This is a great opportunity to get an incredible deal, and I believe you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000).  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a much better deal. It's too early to buy from John, as I have 10 rounds to negotiate and save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value and your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still significantly above my target price.  There is still room to negotiate and save money. I'm not yet ready to purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is closer to my budget and a fair price considering its value. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is within my budget and a good deal considering the product's value.  Continuing to negotiate might save a few more dollars, but the risk of Alice walking away or me having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price."
