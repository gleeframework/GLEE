Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so he's likely to counteroffer, giving you a chance to negotiate further. 
* **It's aggressive but not too unreasonable:** It's unlikely Bob will accept the first offer, but it shows you're serious about maximizing your profit.

Let's see what Bob does!"

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm hoping for, but still higher than John's offer. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's counteroffer is slightly higher than my previous offer and very close to my minimum. Accepting his offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
