"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe it presents a unique opportunity for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but I must respectfully decline at $1,600,000. My budget is more limited, and I believe we can find a mutually agreeable price. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget constraints still prevent me from accepting $1,500,000. I would like to propose $1,450,000 as a compromise. I hope this meets closer to your expectations while still being within my financial limits.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
