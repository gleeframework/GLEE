"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $8,500, which is still a good deal for Alice as it's above her minimum desired price of $8,000. It also keeps me within my budget of $8,000, leaving some room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting close to my maximum limit.  Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation that might not be successful."
