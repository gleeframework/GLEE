"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get an amazing deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, appreciate you coming down. I'm still a bit above my target price. How about $1,050,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go without compromising my own interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price, and you are very close to your target price of $1,000,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids that risk."
