"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but this product offers unique advantages and I believe my initial offer was already a fair reflection of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be frank, taking anything less than $1,275,000 would be selling myself short.  This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. This is my final offer.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
