"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to sell the product for $75, but I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $100. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
