"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,050,000? I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still confident in the product's value exceeding that mark. How about $1,175,000? That's a significant compromise on my end and reflects my eagerness to do business with you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,175,000 and my previous offer of $1,050,000. How about we try $1,112,500? I believe that's a fair price for the product's value to me.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
