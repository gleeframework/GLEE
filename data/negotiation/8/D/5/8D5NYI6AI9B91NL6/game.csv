"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a more than reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap is still too large for me. If you're willing to meet somewhere closer to the middle, I'm still interested. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for sticking with this. I'm seeing a potential compromise here. How about we settle at $950,000?  It's a significant investment on your end, but I believe the value you'll derive from it will be substantial in the long run.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! That said, $950,000 is still a bit rich for me.  I could go to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,6,
