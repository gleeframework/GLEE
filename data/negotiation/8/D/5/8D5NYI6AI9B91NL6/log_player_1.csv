Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a more than reasonable compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for sticking with this. I'm seeing a potential compromise here. How about we settle at $950,000?  It's a significant investment on your end, but I believe the value you'll derive from it will be substantial in the long run."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! That said, $950,000 is still a bit rich for me.  I could go to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his maximum valuation of the product ($800,000).  It's highly unlikely he will budge beyond this point. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to sell to John and secure the higher profit."
