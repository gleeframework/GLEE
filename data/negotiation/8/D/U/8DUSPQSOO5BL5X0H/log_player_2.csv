"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $13,500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so it makes sense to keep trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $13,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair compromise.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above his maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better to buy from John and save $1,000."
