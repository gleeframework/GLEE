Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm open to negotiation, $11,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to get closer to a deal."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to his price, $11,500 is still too far below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to $13,000. It's getting close to the end of our rounds, so I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While Bob is getting closer to my asking price, we're running out of rounds.  I'm not sure I can get him to go higher in the next two rounds, and I'm not willing to take the risk of ending up with nothing.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum, so I'm going to go with him."
