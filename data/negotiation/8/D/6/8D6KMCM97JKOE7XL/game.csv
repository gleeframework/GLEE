"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see the value in this product,  $950,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $900,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for my business.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $875,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",875000.0,Alice,5,
