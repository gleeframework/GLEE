Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low. I have a few more rounds to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,300. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and your budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a price of $8,250 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm concerned that if I reject it, Bob might walk away and I'll be left with no deal.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal altogether."
