"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. Let's start with an offer of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $12,000 is above your desired price range of $15,000.
* **There are more rounds:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, giving you ample opportunity to try and lower the price.
* **Buying from John is the last resort:** While John's offer is higher, it's a good fallback option if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I am interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's closer to your desired price, $11,500 is still above your budget. 
* **There are more rounds:**  You have 7 rounds left to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. 
* **John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, buying from John is still a possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This would be a good compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's still a compromise from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $11,250 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price range. 
* **There are more rounds:**  You still have 5 rounds left to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **John is a backup:** You can always buy from John for $15,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of this product, $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,100.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11,500, but this is as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's getting closer to your price range, $11,500 is still above your ideal budget. 
* **There are more rounds:** You have 3 rounds left to negotiate, and Alice has indicated a willingness to keep negotiating. 
* **John is a safety net:** Buying from John for $15,000 is a backup option if you can't reach a deal with Alice.

It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further, as you have a few rounds remaining and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $11,200.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000, and I'm starting to think that's where we'll have to meet. I can offer you a price of $12,000, but I'm not sure if it's worth going any higher than that. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $12,000 is outside your budget and above your maximum acceptable price. 
* **This is Alice's final offer:** She has explicitly stated that she won't go lower, so further negotiation is unlikely to be successful.
* **Only one round left:** With only one round remaining, there's not enough time to make significant progress.
* **John's offer is still an option:** Buying from John for $15,000 ensures you get the product within your budget, even if it's not the absolute best price.

It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price than risk losing it entirely."
