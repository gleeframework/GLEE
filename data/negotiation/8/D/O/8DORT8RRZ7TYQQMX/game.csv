,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I am interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This would be a good compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's still a compromise from my initial offer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of this product, $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,100. I believe this is a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal at this price.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11,500, but this is as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $11,200. This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",11200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000, and I'm starting to think that's where we'll have to meet. I can offer you a price of $12,000, but I'm not sure if it's worth going any higher than that. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,9,
