Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This gives you a significant saving, and I still get a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to find a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This would allow me to move forward while still providing you with a considerable discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground on this.

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You might be able to find a compromise, but it's not a good idea to accept an offer that's significantly above your budget."
