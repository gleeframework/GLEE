{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $100,000 difference between my offer and Bob's value gives us both space to maneuver during negotiations.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and motivated to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is still too high for me. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can likely get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I might be able to achieve a higher price with Bob. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This gives you a significant saving, and I still get a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the value Bob will receive by pointing out the ""significant saving"" he'll get compared to my initial offer. 
* **Focusing on a win-win:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, making Bob feel like we're working towards a shared solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still out of my price range.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a good deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob has moved closer, there's still room for negotiation. I might be able to get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to find a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This would allow me to move forward while still providing you with a considerable discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground on this."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer is a small compromise, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Focusing on a mutually beneficial solution:** I'm framing the offer as a way for both of us to achieve our goals.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  While Bob has moved closer, the gap between our desired prices is still considerable, and further negotiations might prove futile.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiations failing.

Given the situation, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed outcome."
