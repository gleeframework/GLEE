"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price John is offering. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's potential to save a lot of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  This aggressive approach could lead to a quick agreement if Alice is eager to sell, or it might trigger a counter-counteroffer from her. Either way, it keeps the negotiation moving towards a potentially favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a significant discount from John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower the price.  The goal is to try and secure a price closer to my initial counter-offer of $250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from $250,000 to $300,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to meet her price.  This is a middle ground approach that could lead to a quick agreement or further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $350,000 is a significant discount from John's price of $1,000,000. While there's still room for negotiation, it's likely that Alice is unwilling to go much lower. Accepting the offer secures the product for a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate or Alice walking away from the deal."
