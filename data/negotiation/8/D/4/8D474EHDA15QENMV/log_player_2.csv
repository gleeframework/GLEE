It's not a good deal for Bob to accept the offer at $900,000, as he is only willing to pay $800,000.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than what he is willing to pay. There is room for further negotiation, and Bob can still try to secure a better price."
