Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice is guaranteed $12,000 from John, so she won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $10,000 and $12,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to snag this product before anyone else.  I'm valuing it at $12,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. It's a steal at that price!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Starting Point:** By initially mentioning the $12,000 valuation, Alice sets a strong anchor.
* **Slight Discount:** Offering a $500 discount makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal, even though the price is still above his valuation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrases like ""before anyone else"" and ""a steal at that price"" add a touch of urgency, potentially influencing Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or Alice might have to resort to selling to John. This strategy simply maximizes Alice's potential profit while still offering Bob a seemingly attractive proposition."
