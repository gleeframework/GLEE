"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob wants to save as much as possible.  He can try a counteroffer closer to his target price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you $1,275,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,275,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's becoming increasingly likely that Alice won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate could risk wasting valuable rounds. Since Bob has the option to buy from John at his target price, it's the most sensible choice to secure the product now and avoid further negotiation."
