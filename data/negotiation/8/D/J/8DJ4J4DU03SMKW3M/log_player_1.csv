Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (because you have John as a backup).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. Since you have a strong fallback option (John), you can afford to start with a strong offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  This offer starts significantly closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price without explicitly mentioning your other buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While a strong offer, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could also start with an even higher offer, but be prepared to justify it or potentially negotiate down if Bob is hesitant."
