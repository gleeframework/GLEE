"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $900,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me partway, Alice. How about we settle on $1,100,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is my minimum price, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
