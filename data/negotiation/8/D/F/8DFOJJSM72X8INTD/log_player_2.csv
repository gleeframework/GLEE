# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you like to make a serious offer on it for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is below your maximum:** $14,000 is less than the $15,000 you're willing to spend.
* **Saving money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
