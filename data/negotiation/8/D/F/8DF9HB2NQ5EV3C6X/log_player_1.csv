Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price of $1,000,000 sets a high expectation and gives us room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Strong Message:** The message emphasizes the value and exclusivity of the product, potentially making Bob more eager to acquire it.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just the initial offer. We will need to adapt our strategy based on Bob's response. 
* We have a backup plan with John, ensuring we can still secure a decent profit if negotiations with Bob fail. 
* The goal is to find a balance between maximizing our earnings and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is better than our floor price of $800,000, we have a few reasons to reject it:

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer shows he's interested and willing to pay. We can likely get closer to our desired price with further negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** We have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000. This gives us the flexibility to hold out for a better deal from Bob.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, we maintain control and can make a counter-offer that's more favorable to us.

**Next Steps:**

We will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to our desired $800,000. We will need to analyze Bob's initial offer and his willingness to negotiate to determine our best counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a little lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000?  That way, we both walk away feeling good about the deal. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Rationale:** We're aiming to find a middle ground between our desired price and Bob's initial offer.  $875,000 is a reasonable compromise that allows us to earn significantly more than our minimum while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Positive Message:** The message emphasizes the idea of a mutually beneficial deal, making Bob feel like he's part of a fair negotiation.
* **Strategic Approach:** This counter-offer leaves room for further negotiations should Bob still find the price too high.  

**Important Note:** We are approaching this negotiation cautiously, keeping John's guaranteed offer in mind as our safety net. Our goal is to secure the best possible price for the product."
