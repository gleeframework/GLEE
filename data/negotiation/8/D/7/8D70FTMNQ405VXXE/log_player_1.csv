Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I value the product at $1,000,000, so anything less than that is a loss.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **John's Value:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us:
    * I get closer to my minimum value, making more profit than selling to John.
    * Bob gets a good deal, paying less than he would to John and still getting a product worth $800,000 to him.

This strategy aims for a win-win situation, maximizing my profits while still potentially securing a deal with Bob."
