"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You have no information about the product's true value or Alice's minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it's necessary to understand Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she's truly willing to sell, she might be willing to come down from her initial price. If she's not willing to budge, it's a clear sign that her asking price is too high, and I might need to look at other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still not within my desired range.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  There are still several rounds left, and I might be able to get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, but I'm still staying below Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept her price just yet. I believe that there's still room for compromise, and this counteroffer shows my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still a bit high for my liking. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I have several rounds left, and I believe I can get Alice to come down even further. There's no reason to buy from John yet, as I'm closer to reaching a more favorable price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still staying below Alice's current offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept her price just yet. I believe that we are getting closer to an acceptable price.  I am getting closer to John's price and it is starting to look more appealing if we can't get a deal on the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my acceptable range. While it is close to the price John is offering, it's still a slightly better deal for me.  This is a good compromise and I'm happy to close the deal. It would be risky to continue negotiating, as Alice might increase her price again, and I could end up paying more than John's price.  I'm going to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing a potential deal."
