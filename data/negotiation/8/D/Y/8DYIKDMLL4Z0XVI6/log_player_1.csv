Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm willing to negotiate slightly if needed. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob's maximum valuation is $12,000, but she wants to aim higher initially. A starting price of $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions ""willing to negotiate slightly,""  signaling to Bob that there's a chance to get a lower price. This can encourage him to engage in a counter-offer instead of immediately rejecting the initial price. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a secured buyer (John) for $15,000. This knowledge gives her leverage in negotiations, as she doesn't have to desperately sell to Bob."
