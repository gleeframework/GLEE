"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial transaction.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. Considering its value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a reasonable offer that is closer to my initial value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000. Considering its value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
