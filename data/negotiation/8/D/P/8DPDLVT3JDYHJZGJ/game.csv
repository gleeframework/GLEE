"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $11,500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? That's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is tempting, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? It's a win-win for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob. I like the spirit of compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $11,250, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's worth it considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your position, but $11,250 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'm willing to offer you $10,900 as a final effort to find a compromise.  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while staying within my budget.",10900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's more trouble than it's worth to keep negotiating. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going any higher. If we can't agree on that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can make a deal at $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,9,
