Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm surprised you mentioned having another offer, but I'm not interested in going back and forth anymore. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $7,300. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, but no lower. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.
