"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $7,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high. How about we settle at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $7,200. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding. I can see you're really trying to make this work, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference again and land at $7,050? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7050.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at a point where I can accept $7,050. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $7,300. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal here.",7300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $8,000.  If you'd be willing to come down just a bit more, say to $7,150, I'd much prefer to work with you and close the deal today.",7150.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you mentioned having another offer, but I'm not interested in going back and forth anymore. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $7,300. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, but no lower. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.",7200.0,Alice,9,
