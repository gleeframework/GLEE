,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is just too low for me. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows me to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm ready to pay $14,500 for the product. This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,6,
