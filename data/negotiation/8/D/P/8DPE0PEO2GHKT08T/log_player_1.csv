"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) and also above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value and potential of the product, not just the price. 

This strategy aims to set a high anchor price and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I can adjust my offers in subsequent rounds, but I always have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.** While it's closer to my desired price than the initial offer, it's not enough to make me abandon the negotiation with Bob entirely. 
* **I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.**  This provides me with a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my counteroffer.

I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking value. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my willingness to make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating my belief in the product's value and emphasizing that I'm making a significant concession.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and constructive tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

This counteroffer attempts to bridge the gap between our expectations and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Selling to John is a viable option:** I can still secure a higher price by selling to John.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and try to get a better price.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm prepared to counter with a slightly lower price to try to close the deal, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,025,000.  This is a further concession, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price again, but only by a small amount ($25,000). This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing this price as a ""fair price,"" highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that I'm meeting Bob halfway.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** I'm directly asking for Bob's opinion, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging him to consider the offer.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap further and create a more favorable outcome. I'm still above my minimum acceptable value but am willing to continue negotiations with Bob, keeping the option to sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $987,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below it. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left. There is a chance Bob will continue to increase his offer by small amounts, but it's a risk.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable value and a secure profit. 

Given the limited rounds and the guaranteed profit from John, I believe it's more prudent to sell to John at this point. It minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price than I'm comfortable with, and it secures my desired profit."
