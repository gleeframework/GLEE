"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be a great addition to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement, and it's a significant investment on your end.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to go to $1,300,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to reaching an agreement. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this deal. Let's close this negotiation and finalize this agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
