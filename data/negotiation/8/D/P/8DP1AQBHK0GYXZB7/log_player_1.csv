{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be a great addition to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm aiming for at least $1,500,000, and Bob's offer is significantly lower.
* **I have more rounds to negotiate.** There's still room to maneuver and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but it's not optimal.** I'm aiming for a higher price if possible.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value.  I'll need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring a profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement, and it's a significant investment on your end."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to go to $1,300,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer, I'm aiming for at least $1,500,000.
* **I have more rounds to negotiate.**  I'm willing to continue negotiations and try to squeeze out a slightly higher price. 
* **Selling to John is still a safe option, but I'm hoping to close with Bob at a price closer to my desired value.**

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer and my desired value. I'll need to be strategic about the price I offer, considering the limited rounds remaining and Bob's potential willingness to compromise."

This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this deal.
