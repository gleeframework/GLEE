# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, so I'll offer $900,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate you presenting your offer.  While $900,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering its unique benefits.  Could you consider $1,150,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to find a sweet spot that's closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'll offer $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $900,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,150,000.

{""message"": ""I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  I've been giving this some thought, and to be completely transparent, I have a hard limit of $1,050,000 for this product.  It's an exceptional offer considering its true value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get even closer to my target price. I'll offer $900,000, which is just $100,000 above my maximum budget of $800,000. This should be a more serious offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it.

{""message"": ""I understand that you have a hard limit of $1,050,000, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
