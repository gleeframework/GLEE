"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price point. Would you consider coming down to a more reasonable price closer to my maximum of $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider $1,700,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm confident it reflects the value you'll gain.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $1,400,000? This would allow me to secure the product without exceeding my financial limits.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
