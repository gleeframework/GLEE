,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That way we both get a fair price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise again and go with $100. That's my minimum, and it's a fair price for a product that's worth $100 to you.",100.0,Alice,5,
