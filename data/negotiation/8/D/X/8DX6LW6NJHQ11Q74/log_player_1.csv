Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum price of $8,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** The price is still below what the product is worth to him, making it a potential bargain.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still adjust the price slightly without going too low.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than what you would get from John, it is still less than what you initially aimed for. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
