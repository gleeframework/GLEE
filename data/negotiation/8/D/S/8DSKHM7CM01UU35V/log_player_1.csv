Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening offer, reflecting the product's value to me. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, but I want to see how he values the product before negotiating further. 

I'll keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup in case negotiations continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still see significant value in the product.  I hope this will encourage Bob to close the deal, as it's only a small gap between our positions now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my ideal price. While I'd prefer more,  it's only $30,000 less than my last counteroffer.  The risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price, or a complete stall, is too high. I'll take the $920,000 and close the deal."
