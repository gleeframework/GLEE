```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if he accepts, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still get closer to my desired $14,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm offering $13,500. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaves me some room to negotiate. Hopefully, he'll find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is stubbornly at $13,000, and while I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get any higher. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is closer to my desired price and ensures a good profit. It's time to take the sure thing."
