Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $13,000 is higher than the $10,000 Bob values the product at, making it a potentially attractive deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a $2,000 gap between Bob's value and the offer, allowing for potential compromise.
* **It's below your minimum:** This offer is still higher than your minimum of $15,000, ensuring you don't sell at a loss.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too low to consider.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price that is more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some flexibility. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is above Bob's offer but below my minimum:** $11,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. It's still above my minimum of $15,000, but shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message is positive and focuses on value:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express willingness to compromise. I also highlight the value he'll get at this price. 

This counteroffer creates a reasonable middle ground, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too far off from my target.  Furthermore, it seems like we're stuck in a pattern of back-and-forth offers with no clear movement towards a price we can both agree on.

Given this situation, I believe it's best to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures that I achieve my minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob that is unlikely to be fruitful."
