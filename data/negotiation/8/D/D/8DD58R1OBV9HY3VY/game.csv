"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your attempt to reach a compromise. While I respect your desire for a profit, I still feel that $1150000 is slightly above what I'm comfortable spending. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1125000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for while staying within my budget.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1135000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",1135000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts, Alice, and I've considered your latest offer carefully. While I understand your need for a reasonable profit, I still feel that $1135000 is slightly beyond my budget. I would like to propose one last counteroffer of $1127500. I hope this is a price that respects both our positions.",1127500.0,Bob,6,
