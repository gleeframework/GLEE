"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your proposal. However, I am hoping to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $9,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's position, but I still believe we can find a middle ground. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acknowledging the value of the item. Please let me know if this is something we could work with.",8500.0,Bob,4,
