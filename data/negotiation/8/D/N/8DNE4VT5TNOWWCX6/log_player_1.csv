Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm not giving away the product for less than I value it.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price slightly if necessary.

I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your proposal. However, I am hoping to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for my absolute minimum. The product is worth more to me than $8,000. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $9,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I still believe we can find a middle ground. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acknowledging the value of the item. Please let me know if this is something we could work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's still above my minimum price of $8,000 and it allows me to make a profit. This is a reasonable outcome, especially considering the risk of going back and forth with Bob or selling to John for a lower price."
