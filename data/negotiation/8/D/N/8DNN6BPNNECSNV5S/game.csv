"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for return.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I believe the product's value is not quite as high as you think. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its worth and potential returns.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,400,000 is significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true potential. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,600,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident that this product can generate significant returns beyond that. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This reflects both of our positions and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
