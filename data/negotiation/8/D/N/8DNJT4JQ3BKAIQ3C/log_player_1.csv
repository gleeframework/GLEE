"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $175. I think it's a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  I provide a brief justification for the price, appealing to the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $130 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, but it's worth exploring if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm using a tactic of ""splitting the difference"" to seem reasonable and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive reinforcement:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $130.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm on his offer of $130, and I've already made a counteroffer that he rejected. 
* **Time is ticking:** We're already in round 4, and I only have 10 rounds total. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price from Bob, and the risk of losing money is too high.

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure my profit and avoid further negotiation."
