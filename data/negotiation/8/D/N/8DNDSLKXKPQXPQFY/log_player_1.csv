Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that is above my minimum value of $100, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I believe this price will be attractive to Bob while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum value of $100, and it's likely he won't budge much further. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale rather than risk further negotiations and potentially end up selling to John for a lower price."
