"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price. There's also the option of buying from John for $1,200,000, but it's worth exploring if Bob can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's well above your value of $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to Bob's preferred price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down further. Bob can always choose to buy from John for $1,200,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering our initial discussions and the value you've placed on the product. Let's find a middle ground to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer you the product for $1,290,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to budge any further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000. While it's getting closer, Bob is still better off rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate further. If he doesn't get a better price, he can always buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However,  $1,290,000 is still a bit above my maximum budget. Let's split the difference:  I'm offering $1,270,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1270000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000.  While the negotiations have been productive,  Bob is running out of time (only 3 rounds left).  To ensure he gets the product and doesn't exceed his budget, it's best to buy from John at $1,200,000. This guarantees a purchase within his financial limit."
