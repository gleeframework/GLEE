"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's well above your value of $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering our initial discussions and the value you've placed on the product. Let's find a middle ground to close this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer you the product for $1,290,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to budge any further.",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However,  $1,290,000 is still a bit above my maximum budget. Let's split the difference:  I'm offering $1,270,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1270000.0,Bob,6,
