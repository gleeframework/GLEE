"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I've already received interest from other parties willing to pay a premium. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,500,000. This price reflects its inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product to me while also being a fair price.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation.  The product offers significant long-term value, and $1,100,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your valuation, but $1,400,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
