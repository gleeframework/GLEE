Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I've already received interest from other parties willing to pay a premium. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,500,000. This price reflects its inherent value while acknowledging your interest.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation.  The product offers significant long-term value, and $1,100,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer.
