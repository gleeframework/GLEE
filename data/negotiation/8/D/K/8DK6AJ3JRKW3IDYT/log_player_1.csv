"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to discuss."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. While his counter was expected, accepting such a low price in Round 2 would be a mistake. You have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price, especially given its unique features that I think you'll find particularly beneficial.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're holding firm closer to our desired price while still showing a willingness to negotiate. This counter-offer:

* **Signals Value:**  We're reiterating that the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer.
* **Shows Flexibility:** The price reduction demonstrates our intent to make a deal.
* **Sets a Strong Position:** We're still aiming for a price well above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product. While there's potential to earn a bit more, the difference isn't substantial enough to risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit."
