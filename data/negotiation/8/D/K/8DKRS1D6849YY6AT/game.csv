"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make a starting point. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your starting price is a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to offer $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,17000.0
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500? That's a significant move on my part and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",11500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,16500.0
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but I'm still not convinced that $11,500 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $11,500, which would be $13,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",13750.0,Alice,5,,
