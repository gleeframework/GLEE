"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can work something out.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're firm on $15,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $16,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",16000.0,Alice,5,
