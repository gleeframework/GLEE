Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to sell the product for at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, so offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit margin for you.

By offering the product at $110, you leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $10), while you still earn $30 more than selling to your backup buyer, John."
