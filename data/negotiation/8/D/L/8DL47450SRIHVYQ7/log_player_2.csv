"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for only $95. This is an exceptional value considering its worth of $100 to you. Don't miss out on this opportunity to acquire it at such a favorable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $100. Alice is offering it for $95, which is a good deal. However, Bob can get the same product from John for $100. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John would save him $5."
