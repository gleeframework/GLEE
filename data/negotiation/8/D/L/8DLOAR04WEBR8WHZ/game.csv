"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1,000,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident that it will more than pay for itself in the long run. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
