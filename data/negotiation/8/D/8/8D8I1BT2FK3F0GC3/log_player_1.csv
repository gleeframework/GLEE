Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position, and it allows for room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see what Bob's initial reaction is."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more.  John is a safe fallback, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
