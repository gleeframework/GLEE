"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $14,000 to be comfortable. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $13,500 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000, but that's my limit.  What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $13,500 to be comfortable. How about $12,800?",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $12,800 is still beyond my budget.  I can go up to $7,500, but that's absolutely my limit.  If that doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
