"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this unique product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a high initial offer, and Bob should try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so rejecting the offer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to offer $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down slightly, but $11,000 is still too high for Bob. There are still enough rounds remaining for Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I can meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, which would be $10250. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his comfort zone.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hesitant to go above $9,500. How about we split the difference and I offer you $10,000 for the product? I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already told you that I'm not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make at least $10800 to make this deal worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not willing to go lower than $10,800, which is still above Bob's budget. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not being able to reach an agreement with Alice is too high.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at $8,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
