"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
