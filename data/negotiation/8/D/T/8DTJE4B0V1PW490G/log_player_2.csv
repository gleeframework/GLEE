"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking for a slightly lower price to make this work for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:**  Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. This shows he's serious about buying but wants a good deal.
* **Reasoning provided:**  By stating his reason for wanting a lower price (""to make this work for me""), Bob establishes a foundation for further discussion.  
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with ""Let me know what you think,"" indicating Bob's willingness to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1025000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is better than her initial offer, but it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most financially beneficial option at this point."
