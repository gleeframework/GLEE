Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, there's still a substantial gap between our valuations.  To be candid, anything over $800,000 will be a difficult sell for me.  I could go up to $750,000 if that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting very close to John's offer. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  If we can't make a deal at this price, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly aware of John's offer and is using it as leverage. However, we still have negotiating room and time. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price while still engaging with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close on price. Let's wrap this up. To show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this valuable product in your hands. What do you say, shall we make a deal?"",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We're entering the late stages of negotiation, and it's time to apply pressure while still being reasonable. Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Show Willingness to Close:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, we demonstrate flexibility and a desire to finalize the deal.
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $975,000 is a strong price point, significantly above Bob's offer but with a clear concession from our previous stance.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're implying that time is of the essence, encouraging Bob to act quickly to secure the deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a little too close to John's offer for my liking.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer at $925,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Strong Return:**  $925,000 is a significant profit, exceeding John's offer by a considerable margin. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Bob is clearly aware of our alternative option and is pushing his limit.  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of him walking away and accepting John's offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** A deal in hand is worth more than a potentially better deal in the future. Closing the deal now allows us to use the funds for other opportunities."
