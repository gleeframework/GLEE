"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. $7500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7000.  Would you be willing to consider that? I'm very interested in the product and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price is $7000, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",7250.0,Alice,3,
