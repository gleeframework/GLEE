Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and to make it a great deal, I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $119 might seem too greedy and could make Bob walk away. A price of $100 feels fair while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides a safety net. You can afford to aim higher with Bob."
