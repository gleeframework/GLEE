"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford $12000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $20000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $20000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $14000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $22000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet at this price.",22000.0,Alice,5,
