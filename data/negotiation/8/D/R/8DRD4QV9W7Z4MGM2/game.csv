"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
