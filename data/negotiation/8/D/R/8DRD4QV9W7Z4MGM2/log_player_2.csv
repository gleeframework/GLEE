Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
