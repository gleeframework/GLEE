Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000.  This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but potentially attractive enough to entice him, especially if he believes in its potential.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""one-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to capitalize on the potential for a higher sale price to Bob while still securing your minimum through John if needed."
