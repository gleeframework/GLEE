"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but I want to see if I can get close to my ideal price.  I'm also aware that I have other options (selling to John) if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $85 is closer to my minimum price of $80, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
``` 

I'm offering $88.  This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price and hopefully close enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, $86 is a good price and I'm worried that I'll lose too much time with further negotiation. It's better to secure a deal at this point, especially considering the risk of Bob backing out completely."
