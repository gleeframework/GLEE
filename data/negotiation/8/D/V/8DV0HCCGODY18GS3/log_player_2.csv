Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is the last offer I'm willing to make.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Here's why:

* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Time is running out:** You have only a few rounds left, and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing.
* **John's offer is your target:** John is offering the product at your target price of $8,000. It's a sure thing.

While it might seem tempting to continue negotiating with Alice, the potential gains are small and the risk of ending up with nothing is higher. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate and gotten Alice down to $9,000.  It's time to lock in the deal with John."
