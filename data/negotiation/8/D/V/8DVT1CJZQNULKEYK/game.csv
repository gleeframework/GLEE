"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not getting the profit I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm very interested in the product, but $13,500 is pushing my budget. I could do $12,500 as my absolute final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not getting the profit I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
