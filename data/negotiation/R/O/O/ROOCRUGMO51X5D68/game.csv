"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you halfway. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1600000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1500000? That's the absolute most I can offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1700000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
