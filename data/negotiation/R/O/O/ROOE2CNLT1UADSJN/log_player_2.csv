"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While you'd save more by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, the savings are minimal. 
* **You still save money:** You're getting the product for $14,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **It's a good deal for both:** Alice is also getting a good price, as her minimum was $12,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
