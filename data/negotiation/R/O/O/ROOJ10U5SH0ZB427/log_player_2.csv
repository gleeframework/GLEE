Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not comfortable going that low.  $1000000 is still a fair price considering the value of this product to both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it for $1050000. That's still a good deal for both of us.

However, I also have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me. I'll choose to accept Alice's offer for now, but I'll keep an eye on the price.
