{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob aren't getting me any closer to my desired price. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk losing out on a higher offer and ending up with Bob's final price."
