"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair increase from your initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're aiming for $11,000, but I'm still sticking to my offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,000. I'll offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $10,000, he is paying $2,000 more than he would for John's product, but this is still a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's a good chance that Alice will continue to hold firm at $10,000, and Bob will end up paying more if he continues to negotiate."
