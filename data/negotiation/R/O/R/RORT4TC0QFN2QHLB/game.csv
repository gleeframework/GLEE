"Bob, I have a very unique product I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This is a substantial discount from its true worth. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe this product's value exceeds $1600000, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1400000. This still allows me to make a fair profit, and it's closer to your offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
