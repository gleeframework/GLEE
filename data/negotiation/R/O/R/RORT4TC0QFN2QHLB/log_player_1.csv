"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique product I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. This is a substantial discount from its true worth. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting with a high price allows for more negotiating room and potentially gets Bob thinking about the value of the product. 
* **Value Statement:** Mentioning the ""true worth"" implies the product is worth even more, making the price seem reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to discuss the offer,  keeping the door open for a deal. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** I won't sell for less than $1,200,000, so accepting his offer is not an option. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  $1,600,000 is still a decent starting point for negotiations, and I have several rounds left. 
* **Selling to John is premature:** While I can sell to John for $1,200,000, I have time to explore if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe this product's value exceeds $1,600,000, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,400,000. This still allows me to make a fair profit, and it's closer to your offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I still emphasize the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Fair Profit:**  Mentioning a ""fair profit"" reinforces the price is reasonable.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still above my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll continue to adjust my offer based on Bob's responses. 
* I'll pay close attention to his messaging and try to understand his reasoning for his offers.
* I'll be prepared to sell to John if the negotiations stall or I can't get a better price from Bob."
