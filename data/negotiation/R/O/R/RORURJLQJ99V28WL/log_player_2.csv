"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let's make this happen!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. It doesn't even cover my minimum price. How about we split the difference and meet at $900,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 still isn't enough for me. It's very close to my minimum, but I'd need to go up to $850,000 to make this work. This offer gives you a substantial profit margin, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
