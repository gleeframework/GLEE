``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob to make the offer more attractive. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm signaling willingness to discuss the price, keeping the door open for a successful deal. 
* **Room to maneuver:**  If Bob rejects, I have space to lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also keeping the negotiations open and avoiding a stalemate."
