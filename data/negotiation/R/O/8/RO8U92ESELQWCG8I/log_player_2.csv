"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to your maximum budget than it is to her own valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair starting point for us to work from."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim low, but not insultingly low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us negotiating room. However, it's important to not insult her with an extremely low offer. $1,100,000 is still a significant amount and shows we're serious but aiming for a good deal.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Alice to stay engaged in the negotiation. We want her to see this as a potential win-win."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we still have negotiating room.  Meeting ""halfway"" based on our very different starting points isn't ideal. We'll continue to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,175,000? That represents a significant move on my part, and I think it's a price that could allow us to make this deal happen."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** We're making a significant jump from our previous offer to demonstrate our willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Reasonable but firm:** $1,175,000 is still a good distance from both our initial offer and Alice's offer.  This keeps the pressure on her to move closer to our desired range. 
* **Positive outlook:**  We continue to emphasize that we want to find a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with your budget, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, we're still in a good position to negotiate. We've made steady progress, and there's no rush to settle just yet. We'll continue pushing towards our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I think we're getting close to a deal we can both agree on. To show how serious I am, I'm willing to offer $1,210,000. It's a strong offer, and I believe it fairly reflects the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1210000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** We're strategically increasing our offer to show Alice we're serious about closing the deal. This offer is a significant move from our previous offer and puts us in a strong position to reach an agreement.
* **Confident tone:** We want to exude confidence in this offer. It's a fair price and presents an opportunity for Alice to secure a sale without further negotiation.
* **Time consideration:**  We're past the halfway point in the rounds. While we're not desperate yet,  putting a good offer on the table now increases the likelihood of securing the deal at a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad to see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us, and I'm excited about the prospect of closing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $1,220,000 is a solid price for the product. It falls well within our budget and represents a significant saving compared to both our maximum budget and John's offer.
* **Negotiating fatigue:**  We've been going back and forth for a while now.  Further haggling over small amounts might not be worth the effort. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we *might* get the price down a tiny bit more, there's also the risk Alice gets frustrated or we run out of rounds. Securing the deal at this price is the smart move."
