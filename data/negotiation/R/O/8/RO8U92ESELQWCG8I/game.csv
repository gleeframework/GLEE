"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great opportunity.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair starting point for us to work from.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,175,000? That represents a significant move on my part, and I think it's a price that could allow us to make this deal happen.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with your budget, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're getting close to a deal we can both agree on. To show how serious I am, I'm willing to offer $1,210,000. It's a strong offer, and I believe it fairly reflects the value of this product.",1210000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad to see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us, and I'm excited about the prospect of closing the deal.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
