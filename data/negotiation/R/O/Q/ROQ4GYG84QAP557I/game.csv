"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $9,000 for the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500. This price reflects the quality and value of the product while remaining competitive with your offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,
