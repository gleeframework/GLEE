Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part and keeps us on track to close a mutually beneficial deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm motivated to find an agreement, but to be transparent, $1,000,000 falls short of what I can accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.
