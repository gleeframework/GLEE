"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to open negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially lets you secure a deal closer to your ideal outcome. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" and ""true worth,"" aiming to justify the high initial price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  By stating ""I am open to discussing this further,"" I signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, making him more likely to engage. 

This strategy balances a strong opening with an invitation for Bob to counter, setting the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $2,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm more comfortable with a price around $800,000.  Would you be open to something closer to that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is always an option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more agreeable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part and keeps us on track to close a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Bridge:** The message acknowledges Bob's counteroffer but firmly reiterates that it's too low. The phrase ""to find a middle ground"" aims to steer the negotiation towards a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The counteroffer of $1,900,000 represents a substantial decrease from the initial offer. This signals flexibility and willingness to negotiate while staying significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum price.
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message subtly reinforces the product's value, reminding Bob of the potential benefits, hoping to justify the higher price point. 

This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to your target range while maintaining a firm stance on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a significant leap for me.  To be frank, I'm working with a budget closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to come down closer to that range, I think we could close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered his perceived value for the product, $1,000,000. While this is a significant jump from his previous offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. There's a chance he might be willing to go slightly higher, especially since he seems eager to close the deal. Rejecting and countering keeps the negotiation alive for a potentially better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm motivated to find an agreement, but to be transparent, $1,000,000 falls short of what I can accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Finality:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and emphasize the need for Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Concession (but with Limits):**  You've moved closer to Bob's budget but held firm above your absolute minimum. This signals a willingness to compromise but not at the cost of a significant loss.
* **Justification:** You've clearly explained that while you value making a deal, the offered price is simply too low.  The new price is presented as a firm but fair compromise.

This approach aims to secure the best possible price while acknowledging Bob's constraints. It also prepares you to walk away and pursue the guaranteed offer from John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. However,  $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can offer you $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob is incrementally increasing his offer. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly below your $1,500,000 backup offer from John. 

There's a chance Bob could still go higher, and it's worth using the remaining rounds to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to consider a deal at $1,400,000. However, this is non-negotiable. It reflects the true value of this product and my absolute bottom line. Let me know if this works for you so we can wrap things up."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer meets Bob more than halfway from your previous offer while still staying above your $1,500,000 safety net. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By explicitly stating a final price, you emphasize the need for a decision.
* **Limited Time:** With only a few rounds remaining, you want to guide Bob toward a conclusion and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.

This strategy aims to secure a favorable price while recognizing the value of closing the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now. I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid $1,400,000 is still pushing my limits.  My final offer is $1,200,000. It's a strong offer, and I think it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but strategically it's the right time to walk away. Here's why:

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has presented his ""final offer"" of $1,200,000. While he might be using negotiation tactics, it's very likely he won't go much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. The potential gain from squeezing Bob further is outweighed by the potential loss of a sure deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, the odds of significantly bridging the $200,000 gap are slim. 

While turning down $1,200,000 feels counterintuitive, accepting John's offer guarantees you achieve your minimum target and avoids the risk of ending the negotiation with nothing."
