"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $11000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $11250, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so think carefully before responding.",11250.0,Alice,5,
