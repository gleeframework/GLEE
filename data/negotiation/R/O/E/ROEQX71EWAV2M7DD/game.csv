"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to at least get $850,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let's continue the discussion and find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
