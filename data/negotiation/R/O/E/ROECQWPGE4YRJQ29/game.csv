"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $13,000 is a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? It's a fair price for a product that's worth so much to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $14,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $14,500, but that's my final offer. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $14,500, which would be $14,250. That's the best I can do.",14250.0,Bob,6,
