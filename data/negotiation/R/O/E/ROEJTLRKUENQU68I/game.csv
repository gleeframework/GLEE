"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you being interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $175? Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $175 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $160? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",160.0,Bob,4,
