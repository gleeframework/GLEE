{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150** is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and sets a positive tone, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:** Starting high gives me more room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will reveal if he's serious about buying and how much he values the product.
* **Maintain a positive negotiation dynamic:** A friendly approach can encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's still above my minimum value.**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer.** I want to see if I can find a price that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is acceptable, I'm not in a rush to sell. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get a better price.  I'm confident that I can counter-offer and find a price that's closer to my desired price.  I'm also not afraid to walk away if necessary and sell to John, but I want to explore all options first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counter-offer of $135 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a fair price for both of us, encouraging a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Reasoning:** 
    * I believe $135 is a reasonable compromise that's closer to my desired price.
    * By acknowledging Bob's offer while proposing a higher price, I show I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell at his initial price.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:** $135 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintain a positive negotiation dynamic:** A friendly and reasonable approach encourages continued negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's commitment:**  Bob's response will reveal if he's serious about buying at a price closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my desired price.** While I would prefer $135, $130 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Accepting the offer ensures a sale.** I've already negotiated a good price, and continuing to haggle risks losing the deal altogether.

**Reasoning:**

I want to get the best possible price, but I'm not in a position to be overly stubborn.  $130 is only $5 less than my last counteroffer, and it's likely Bob won't budge further. Accepting his offer is the most logical choice, as it guarantees a sale at a decent price and avoids the risk of getting a lower offer or even no offer at all."
