"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's find a middle ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,250,000?  That way, we both get a fair price and can move forward with the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
