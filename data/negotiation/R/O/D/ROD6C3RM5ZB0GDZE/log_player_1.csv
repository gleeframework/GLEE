Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to incentivize Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $10,000, Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation but higher than her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $12,000.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:

* **Alice:** Earns $1,500 more than her minimum.
* **Bob:** Gets the product for $500 less than his perceived value."
