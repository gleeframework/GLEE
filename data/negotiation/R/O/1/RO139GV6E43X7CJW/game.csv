"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,800 is closer, but I'm still looking to pay a little less. I'm prepared to offer $9,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,600. This is the last time I'll be making an offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9600.0,Alice,5,
