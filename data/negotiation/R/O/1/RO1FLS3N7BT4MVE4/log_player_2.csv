You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

You're still above your maximum price point, and you've already shown willingness to negotiate. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can close the gap further."
