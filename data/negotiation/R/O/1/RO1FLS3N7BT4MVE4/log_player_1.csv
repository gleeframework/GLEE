Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My floor:**  I'm willing to accept $15,000 from John, so anything above that is profit.
* **Bob's ceiling:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation starting point:** Offering $14,000 is a fair starting point. It's close to my floor, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.
* **Positive message:** Using a friendly and positive message increases the chance of Bob engaging in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my floor:** While $12,500 is a better price than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I can still potentially get a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Potential for a win-win:** By continuing the negotiation, I might be able to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $13,500 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting a price closer to my target.
* **Positive language:** I use a friendly tone and reiterate my belief in the product's value to maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $13,500 is still slightly above my floor of $15,000. This leaves some room for Bob to make another counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my floor:**  $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to $15,000, accepting this offer is still profitable and a good outcome. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Even if I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Bob will be willing to go higher. 
* **Time consideration:**  Continuing the negotiation might drag on and potentially lead to a situation where John's offer expires or becomes less viable.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit without the risk of getting a lower offer later on or losing the opportunity to sell to John."
