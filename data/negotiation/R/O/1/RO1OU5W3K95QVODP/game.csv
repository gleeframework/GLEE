"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
