,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $170 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130 right now.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $145 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? I'm really eager to buy this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $137.50 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $142.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great price for both of us.",142.5,Alice,5,
