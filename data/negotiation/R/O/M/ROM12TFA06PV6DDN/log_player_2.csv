Alice's offer is too high. It's above my maximum budget of $120. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $170 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Alice has come down in price, $145 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $145 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? I'm really eager to buy this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $137.50 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $142.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still above my budget. It's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to be able to get a much lower price from Alice. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120, I'm going to take that offer."
