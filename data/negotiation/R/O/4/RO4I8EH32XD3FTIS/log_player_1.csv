{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential concessions while still allowing me to earn a significant profit. It also signals to Bob that I am serious about selling and encourages him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is still a good profit, it's closer to my minimum than I'd like. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000? This would still leave you with a good deal, and I could make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $1,280,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a bit more, it's a reasonable offer considering the negotiation process.  Accepting his offer will allow me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower offer or even a rejection."
