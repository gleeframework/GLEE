"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $775,000 is closer, but it's still not quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference at $812,500?  This gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're a tough negotiator! I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $790,000? That's a significant move on my end.",790000.0,Bob,6,
