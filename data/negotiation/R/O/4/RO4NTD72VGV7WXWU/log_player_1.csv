I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll have room to negotiate downwards, while still potentially earning more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still keeping my profit margin higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good deal. It's more than John's offer and still provides a decent profit margin.  I'm accepting his offer to finalize the deal."
