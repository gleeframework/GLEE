"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $100 is your maximum, it's always worth seeing if you can get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start a negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
