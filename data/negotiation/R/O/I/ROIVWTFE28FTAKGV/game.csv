"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value our ongoing conversation, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, while allowing me to achieve a fair return.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $775,000.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. To make this deal work, I'm prepared to lower my price to $800,000.  This price is fair to both of us, as it's the minimum I can accept while still ensuring a worthwhile transaction.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
