"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, I believe we can find a price closer to the value I place on the product. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I'll see if I can get him to come closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value our ongoing conversation, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, while allowing me to achieve a fair return.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm reducing my initial offer slightly, but still maintaining a price that's higher than Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also showing that I'm not desperate to sell at any price.  This should encourage Bob to come up a bit higher in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $775,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe I can get him to pay closer to $800,000 if I keep negotiating. There's no need to rush into a deal, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. To make this deal work, I'm prepared to lower my price to $800,000.  This price is fair to both of us, as it's the minimum I can accept while still ensuring a worthwhile transaction.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm now offering the product at my minimum price, acknowledging that it's a fair value for Bob.  This should encourage him to accept the offer.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John for the same price, so I'm not taking any risks by offering this lower price."
