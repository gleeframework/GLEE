"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can offer you a price of $912,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been tough to negotiate with! I understand the value, but I have a budget to stick to. I'm willing to go up slightly to $890,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer you a price of $915,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",915000.0,Alice,7,
