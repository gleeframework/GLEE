Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer you a price of $915,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.

This is a tough one, but it's getting to the point where the potential savings aren't worth the risk of Alice walking away.  Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she's close to her limit. 
* **Good Discount:** $915,000 is a decent price, significantly below John's $1,200,000.
* **Time:**  We're past the halfway point, and continued haggling might irritate Alice.

It's unlikely we'll get much lower than $915,000 without risking the deal."
