Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being profitable for me. It also sets a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is still a good deal for me, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $130. I'm confident I can negotiate with Bob and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is still profitable, I want to see if I can get a little closer to $120. I'll make a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $115 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm running out of rounds, $110 is still below my minimum price point. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this deal work, but $110 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $115 one last time.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $105. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob not willing to budge from his offer of $105, it's not worth risking losing a sale altogether. John is a guaranteed sale at $100, which is my minimum price point.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
