{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You still have room to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It states your price and invites him to respond.

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, you create an incentive for him to negotiate. This gives you the opportunity to potentially reach a price closer to your desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's far below my minimum of $1,500,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
