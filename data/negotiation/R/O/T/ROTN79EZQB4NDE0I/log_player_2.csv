(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $5,000 is a great price, but it's still early in the negotiation.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since you're not immediately jumping at her offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% reduction from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates my interest while also showing I'm serious about getting a better deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $5,500 is closer to my preferred price, it's still higher than my counteroffer. Alice seems stubborn, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. There's still a chance she might come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm serious about buying the product and to potentially meet Alice halfway. However, I'm still keeping the price lower than her latest offer, hoping to find a compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is increasing her price, which is concerning. However, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price. There are still 5 rounds remaining, and I'm not ready to give up on finding a deal that's within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is becoming increasingly stubborn, but I'm going to try to meet her halfway by increasing my offer. I'm hoping this will get her to reconsider and bring her offer down to something closer to my target price. It's a gamble, but I still have a few rounds to go and am not willing to give up just yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is stubbornly sticking to her high prices. While the deal with John is still a viable option, I'm not ready to give up just yet.  I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price with Alice.  I have a few rounds remaining, and I'm willing to see if I can break through her resistance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems to be moving in the wrong direction with her price increases, so I'm taking a gamble and increasing my offer. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping that showing some flexibility and compromise will lead Alice to reconsider and potentially make a lower counter-offer in the next round.  I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to $5,000 but with only a few rounds remaining, I need to try and find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is becoming increasingly unreasonable, pushing her price higher with each round. With only one round remaining, the chances of her accepting a lower offer are slim. Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees me the product within my budget, and it's the best strategy at this point. It's frustrating to have to pay more than I'd hoped, but securing the product is more important than risking another round of potentially futile negotiation."
