Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

Since Bob values the product at $120 and I have a guaranteed backup buyer at that price, there's no need to risk lowering my price. This ensures I get the maximum value for the product while still offering Bob a fair deal."
