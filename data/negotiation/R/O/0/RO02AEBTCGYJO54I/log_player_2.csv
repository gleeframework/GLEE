"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm getting close to considering other offers. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

```

Alice is clearly firm on the price and has indicated she's getting close to considering other offers.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more in negotiation,  it's unlikely you'll get it down to your ideal price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best option to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price."
