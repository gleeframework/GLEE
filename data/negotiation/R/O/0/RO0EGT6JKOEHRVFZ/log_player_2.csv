# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $11,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, it's a better deal for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
