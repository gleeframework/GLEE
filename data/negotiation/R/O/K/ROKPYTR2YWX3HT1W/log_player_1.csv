``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a starting point. It's above my minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.

*  This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I believe I can get more. Since he's already expressed interest, I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my initial asking price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $9,000? This would still give me a fair price for the product and leave room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I've acknowledged Bob's offer and expressed willingness to negotiate.
* I've proposed a counteroffer of $9,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my ideal price than John's offer of $8,000. Since I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob, I'll accept his offer.  It's a good deal, considering my minimum value."
