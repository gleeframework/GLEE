Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. This price is fair considering my budget and the potential savings you'd gain from selling quickly. Let me know what you think.
