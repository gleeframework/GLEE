"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $110? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a decent profit.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $120. That's my final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
