"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $9000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250? I'm serious about buying your product, and this is the best I can do.",8250.0,Bob,4,
