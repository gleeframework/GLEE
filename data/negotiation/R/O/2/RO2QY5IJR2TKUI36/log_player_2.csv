"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within the realm of possibility considering he's willing to pay up to $8,000.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer provides room for both parties to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Sets a Clear Boundary:** By stating a firm price, Bob avoids getting stuck in a lengthy back-and-forth with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer than her initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's already shown his willingness to compromise, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I'm serious about buying your product, and this is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and Bob's maximum budget.
* **Clear Intention:** The message reiterates Bob's desire to buy the product, adding urgency to the negotiation.
* **Finality:**  By stating ""this is the best I can do"", Bob sets a clear expectation that a final decision is needed.  This can encourage Alice to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation rounds."
