"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $9000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to me, and Bob is offering $7,500. I'm not willing to accept that yet, so I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250? I'm serious about buying your product, and this is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal now."
