"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but reflects the true value of what I'm offering.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer by highlighting the product's value to Bob, which might incentivize him to be more willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating that I'm ""willing to start"" with this price, I'm explicitly indicating that I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Building a Relationship:**  I'm starting with a friendly tone, aiming to build rapport with Bob and create a more cooperative atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. I need to continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value this product will bring to your business.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting but Staying Engaged:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but emphasizing my willingness to continue negotiating. 
* **Justifying the Counteroffer:** I'm not just giving an arbitrary number. I'm explaining why $1,300,000 is a fair price based on the value of the product.
* **Concession and Incentive:**  I'm highlighting that this is a ""significant concession"" to encourage Bob to move closer to my price. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the negotiation as a search for a mutually beneficial agreement,  appealing to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal target. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since he's already showing a willingness to compromise. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, I can attempt to push for a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work towards a deal. While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I acknowledge Bob's increased offer and show appreciation for his willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,200,000). This reinforces the idea of a compromise and a fair deal.
* **Concession and Finality:** I highlight my concession to encourage Bob to accept and emphasize that this is a fair final offer.
* **Closing the Deal:** I use language like ""let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000, but I'm still only able to offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute limit of my budget. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to consider other options.  Let's see if we can find a way to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I value a good relationship with Bob and appreciate his willingness to negotiate, it's becoming clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement that meets my needs.  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. To ensure I maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob, I will sell the product to John."
