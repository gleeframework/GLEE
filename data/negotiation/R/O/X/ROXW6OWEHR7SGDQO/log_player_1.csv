{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I am still getting a good profit, but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to the $15,000 mark as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. That still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. That's the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $11,500 isn't ideal, it's a significant improvement over selling to John for $10,000.  The negotiation process has allowed me to secure a price that's within a reasonable range of my desired value, and I believe further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome."
