"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. That still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. That's the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
