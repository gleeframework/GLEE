"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $18000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I've already made a few concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $17000. I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page, and I'd rather explore other options. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $17000, but if not, I'll have to consider other buyers.",17000.0,Alice,7,
