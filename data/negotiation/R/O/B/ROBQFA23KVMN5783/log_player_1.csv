Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $105. Since $105 is lower than the minimum value I have for the product, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.
