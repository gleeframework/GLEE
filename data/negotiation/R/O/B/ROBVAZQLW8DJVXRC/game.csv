"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500?  This is still a great deal for a product of this quality, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
