**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. There's a good chance Alice might come down further to avoid losing the sale altogether."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,750 is a very good deal and only slightly above my budget, I'm hesitant to risk going another round with Alice.  I've already rejected her last two offers, and it's possible she won't budge any further. Buying from John for $10,000 is a guaranteed win, and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
