(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $80 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $120 is not a good idea.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

While $110 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher than he wants to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is Bob's maximum price.  He should see if Alice will accept this offer, but if she doesn't, he can buy from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer of $90 is lower than Bob's maximum of $80, so it's a good deal for him. There are only a few rounds left, so it's worth accepting this offer rather than risking not getting a deal at all."
