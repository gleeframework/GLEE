"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's also a reasonable price, given the product's value, allowing Alice to make a profit. By offering $1,050,000, Bob is testing the waters and seeing if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This price reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both parties. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his previous offer of $1,050,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about getting the product at this price. It also maintains pressure on Alice to negotiate further, as she knows that Bob has a fallback option with John. By repeating his previous offer, Bob hopes to secure a deal while remaining within his budget."
