Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure makes sense. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While we start high, the offer leaves a small amount of room for Bob to potentially negotiate down if he wishes.
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a guaranteed backup offer of $8,000 from John, ensuring we won't be forced to go below our minimum acceptable price."
