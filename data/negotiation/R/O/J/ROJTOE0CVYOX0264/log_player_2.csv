Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $12,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, and we're halfway through the negotiations.  I've tried to lower the price, but it seems like Alice is firm.  It's better for me to accept John's offer at this point and avoid potentially getting stuck with a higher price."
