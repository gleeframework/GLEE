Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it would be of great value to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly above her minimum.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  If Alice starts too high (close to $12,000), Bob might be turned off and reject the offer outright.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob."
