"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,100,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one last concession and offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is my final offer.  I really want this product to go to someone who will appreciate it, but if you can't meet this price, I'll need to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last concession, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
