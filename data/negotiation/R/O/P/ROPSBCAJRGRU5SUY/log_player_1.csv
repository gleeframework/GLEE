"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  The initial offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), but still leaves room for profit if Bob negotiates. 
* **Open Communication:**  I encourage open communication to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible.** While Bob's offer is low, I believe I can negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is an option, but not yet necessary.**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my desired price.**  $1,450,000 is still above my minimum but represents a compromise.
* **Emphasize the discount:**  I highlight the discount from my initial offer to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to compromise:**  I reiterate my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible, but getting risky.**  I'm not sure if I can get Bob to budge much more.  
* **Selling to John is becoming more appealing.** I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John would guarantee a good outcome.  However, I'm willing to give one more counteroffer to see if Bob will come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,100,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one last concession and offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is my final offer.  I really want this product to go to someone who will appreciate it, but if you can't meet this price, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** I'm getting close to my minimum and need to show Bob that I'm serious.
* **Emphasize the Finality:**  I state this is my final offer to push Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative Option:** I remind Bob that I have other options to create urgency.
* **Slight Concession:** $1,350,000 is still above my minimum, but it's a considerable concession from my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your last concession, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  Even though he's met me halfway, $1,225,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiation rounds remaining.** We're nearing the end of our rounds, and I'm not confident that I can convince Bob to go higher.
* **Selling to John guarantees a good outcome.**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I meet my minimum and secure a profitable sale.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high at this point."
