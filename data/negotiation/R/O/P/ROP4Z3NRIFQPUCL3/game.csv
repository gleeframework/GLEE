"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  To be frank, my budget is closer to $750,000 for this product.  If you're able to work within that range, I think we can make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll sell the product to you for $800,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
