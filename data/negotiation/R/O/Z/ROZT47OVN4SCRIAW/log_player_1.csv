Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price is still fair, considering the product's worth to you. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, his persistence in low-balling me is making me lose faith in his willingness to pay a fair price. I'm going to sell the product to John. It's a guaranteed sale at a price that aligns with the value I've placed on the product."
