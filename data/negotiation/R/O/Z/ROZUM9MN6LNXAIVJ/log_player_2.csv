"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, for a price that will allow both of us to benefit significantly. I understand this product is also worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's be fair - I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This gives you a slight advantage, and allows me to get a bit more than my minimum. Let me know what you think!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
