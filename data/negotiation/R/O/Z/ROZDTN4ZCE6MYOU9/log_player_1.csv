Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high but stay reasonable. Offering the product at $9,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while securing a significant profit margin.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, making $9,000 an attractive price point.
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
