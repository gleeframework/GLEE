"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's negotiate! Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to bargain before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest, but it's clear that the initial price is not acceptable.
* **Strategic Target:** A counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a strong starting point that is significantly below Alice's asking price but still leaves room for us to potentially meet in the middle."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but we still have some negotiating room. It's not time to go to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While that's closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving closer to a potential agreement. Increasing our offer by $150,000 shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still significantly below John's price, keeping the pressure on Alice to make a competitive offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Her latest offer of $1,250,000 is only slightly better than John's offer of $1,200,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for such a small potential gain.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
