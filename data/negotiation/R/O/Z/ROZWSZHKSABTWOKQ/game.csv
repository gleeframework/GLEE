"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
