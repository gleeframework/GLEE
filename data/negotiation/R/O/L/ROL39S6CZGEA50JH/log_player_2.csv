Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $16,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
