"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $950,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $925,000 for the product. This is my best offer based on my current financial situation. I hope this meets your needs as well.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still below the minimum I can accept for it. To make this work, I need to be closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to compromise at $990,000? This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still fitting within your budget.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your proposal. I've carefully considered the value of the product and my budget constraints. I would like to counteroffer at $970,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and my financial limitations.",970000.0,Bob,6,
