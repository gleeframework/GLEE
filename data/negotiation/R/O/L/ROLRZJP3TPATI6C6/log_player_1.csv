{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:** I'm being positive and emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. This could make him more likely to consider my offer.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation drags on or I feel like I'm not getting close to my desired price, I'll stop the negotiation and sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my desired range, I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1,200,000.
* **I have a guaranteed backup option.**  John is ready to buy the product for my minimum price, so I have no reason to settle for a lower offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my desired $1,200,000. I'll be flexible but firm, and ready to walk away if necessary."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still significantly lower than the value of this product.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within My Range:** $975,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, suggesting he might be leaving money on the table by refusing to pay more.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my goal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess the situation. If his counter-offer remains too low, I'll either reject it or make another counter-offer. If we can't find common ground, I'll sell to John."
