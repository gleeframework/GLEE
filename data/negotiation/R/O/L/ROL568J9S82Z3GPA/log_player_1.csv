"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product. This also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a significant profit. I believe this offer is more appealing to Bob while still being favorable to me."
