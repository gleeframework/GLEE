{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $18,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards. It also signals that I value the product highly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Adding ""open to discussing a fair price"" encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, giving me a chance to gauge his interest. 
* **Plan B:** Remember, I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.  This gives me leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While I'm happy to meet in the middle, Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum.  It's worth trying to squeeze out a bit more.
* **Counter-Offer Potential:**  I can likely get a higher price from Bob if I counter-offer. He's clearly interested in the product.
* **No Immediate Need:**  Selling to John would be acceptable, but I have no urgent need to sell, so it's worth trying for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $12,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it a great investment. "", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between my initial price and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** ""Fair compromise"" and ""great investment"" make the counteroffer seem appealing.

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic counteroffer that aims to reach a mutually acceptable price while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 more than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This is a small difference, making it worthwhile to accept.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  While it's close to my minimum, there's a chance that further negotiation could push the price even higher. However, there's also the risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is an option, accepting Bob's offer ensures a slightly higher profit and potentially opens the door for future business with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the relatively small difference between Bob's offer and my minimum price, and the potential for future transactions with Bob, accepting his offer is the most logical decision."
