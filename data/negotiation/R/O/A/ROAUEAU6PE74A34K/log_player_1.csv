Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing a good deal. This sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:** 

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he's truly interested, he'll likely counteroffer, giving me a chance to further negotiate.
* **Secure a higher price:**  If Bob accepts the initial offer, I'll get a good price, especially considering I have a backup buyer. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize my profit, but also to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, it's not worth accepting Bob's offer. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $11,500 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need something closer to $12,500. This would be a fair compromise, and still allow you to get a great deal on a product you value."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my desired price. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but express that it's too low. I emphasize a compromise by offering a price that is still higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
    * **Explore a middle ground:** This counteroffer opens the door for further negotiation while keeping the deal within a range that benefits both parties. 
    * **Keep Bob engaged:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable paying $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to my desired price range. While it's still below my minimum value of $15,000, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer.  Considering:

* **The risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and I could end up with a lower price or even lose the sale altogether.
* **The opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate could take time, and I might lose out on the opportunity to sell to John for $15,000.

It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer, as it provides a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
