Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
