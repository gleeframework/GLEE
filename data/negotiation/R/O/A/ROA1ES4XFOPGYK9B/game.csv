"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for your business.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to pay $900000.  I'm confident this price is fair given its potential benefit to me and the fact that I'm your only buyer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm willing to compromise, however, and come down to $950000. This price still allows me to get a good return on my investment, while also acknowledging the potential value you see in the product.  Let's continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that $925000 is a fair price that recognizes both the value of the product and my desire to make this a successful transaction. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925000 is still slightly below where I need to be.  I'm prepared to finalize the deal for $940000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward.",940000.0,Alice,5,
