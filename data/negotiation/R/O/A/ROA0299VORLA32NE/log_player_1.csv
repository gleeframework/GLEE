I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a significant profit for me while still leaving a good amount of value for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in this deal and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $950,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, and I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."
