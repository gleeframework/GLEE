Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $12,000 is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it's still a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for a back-and-forth and potentially a win-win scenario.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  Mentioning the product's value to me helps frame the offer as a good deal for him. 
* **Prepared to walk away:** If Bob isn't willing to negotiate, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, I am looking to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob, as he clearly values the product. 
* **Risk of losing the sale:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum price, there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next steps:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a significant discount from what I'd normally sell it for. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  $10,000 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Final offer:**  Stating it's my final offer adds pressure for Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth further emphasizes the potential bargain. 
* **Prepared to walk away:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still aiming to keep my spending within my budget. I would like to propose $9,000 as a compromise. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $9,000 is just $6,000 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could reject and try to get closer to $10,000, there's no guarantee Bob would budge further. 
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  If I reject and Bob walks away, I'm left with selling to John for $15,000, which is a significant loss.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and allows me to make a profit, even though it's not my ideal price."
