"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's significantly less than its true market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob ($800,000), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that it's a good deal for him. 

This strategy aims to initiate a negotiation that is beneficial to me while leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a higher price if I continue the negotiations.
* **Time is on My Side:**  I have 10 rounds to reach a deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer now allows me to potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a significant advantage over purchasing elsewhere. Let's seal the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  My counteroffer of $1,000,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price.  This ensures I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Reasoning & Justification:** I'm providing Bob with a logical reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and the opportunity for him to secure it at a good price.
* **Finality:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm signaling that this is a serious offer.  If Bob rejects this, I might be inclined to sell to John instead.

**Strategy:**

By sticking to my minimum price, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to decide. He can either accept this offer or risk losing out on the product completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to settle for less, especially since I have the option to sell to John for my minimum.
* **Negotiation Continues:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can convince Bob to come closer to my price.
* **Time is Still on My Side:** I have 6 rounds left (10 total - 4 already passed). This gives me time to explore further negotiation before resorting to selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, perhaps $950,000, and continue to emphasize the value of the product and the potential for Bob to secure a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's reach an agreement on this price, and I can guarantee you'll be very happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards My Minimum:**  I'm counteroffering at $950,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and how this price represents a great deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations moving forward.
* **Emphasize Positive Outcome:**  I'm framing the agreement as a win-win situation for both of us.

**Strategy:**

By making a smaller concession and emphasizing the value of the deal, I hope to entice Bob to accept my offer.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter again in the next round, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $950,000 is still a bit too much for me. My absolute maximum is $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both moved significantly from our initial positions.  Let's close the deal at this price and call it a day. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to compromise my minimum just yet.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. However, I believe I can still reach my minimum price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can convince Bob to increase his offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, perhaps $975,000, and emphasize the importance of reaching an agreement in the remaining rounds. I'll also remind Bob of the potential downsides if he doesn't accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm running out of time, and I need to be close to my asking price. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to drop to $975,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers. Let's finalize this deal and avoid losing out on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near Minimum:** My counteroffer of $975,000 is just $25,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the limited time remaining, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer, increasing the pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Potential Loss:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the potential consequence of rejection: losing out on the product altogether.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to be a strong final push, making a small concession while emphasizing the time constraint.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
