"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $9,500. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but still leaves me with a profit margin above my minimum of $8,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Test the waters:**  See if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price point.
* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer downward in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. By rejecting his offer and proceeding to the next round, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $9,500, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me with a profit margin above my minimum. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  Testing if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Maintain some profit margin:**  Ensuring that I don't sell too low too quickly. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  Continuing to push towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am still holding out for a better deal.  I believe that with more negotiation, I can push for a price closer to my desired $9,000.

* **Remaining hopeful:**  I believe that I can still convince Bob to come closer to my price.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to remain in control of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final concession. I'm dropping my price to $8,900, which is only $100 more than Bob's last offer. This shows Bob that I am serious about making a deal, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit.

* **Final compromise:**  This is my last attempt to find a price both of us can agree on.
* **Closing the gap:**  By dropping the price by a small amount, I'm hoping to entice Bob into accepting the deal.
* **Avoiding John:**  I'm still hoping to avoid selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, the negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge further. While $8,800 is still less than my ideal price, it's significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a better price for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a breakdown in the negotiations altogether."
