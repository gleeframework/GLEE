"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $11,000?  That's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,250 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with that.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'd like to propose $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,6,
