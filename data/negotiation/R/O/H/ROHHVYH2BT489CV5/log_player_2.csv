"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** While low, $7,000 is still a reasonable profit for Alice considering her product's value is $8,000 to her.
* **Polite and Open:** The message maintains a positive and open tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $7,000. I can do $8,500 for you. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  While Alice didn't meet my price, she moved closer to the middle ground. This suggests she's open to further negotiation.
* **Target Price in Sight:** My goal is to get the product for under $8,000. With a little more bargaining, I might be able to get closer to that target. 
* **John is the Backup:**  John's offer of $10,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations stall too much, I can always fall back on buying from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down in price, so now I'm meeting her halfway between her current offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($7,000). 
* **Reaching My Target:** $8,000 is the highest price I'm willing to pay to ensure I get a good deal.
* **Clear and Direct:** The offer is presented clearly and emphasizes that this is a fair price point for both parties."
