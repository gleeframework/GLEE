Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to consider purchasing it, but I need to start at a more reasonable price point. I'm offering $850,000, which is still a strong value for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that offer is still a bit low for what I have in mind, I'm willing to come down a bit to keep us moving.  How about we meet halfway between our two previous numbers at $1,175,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,175,000 is still outside my price range. Let's try to find a number we can both agree on. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This represents a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000."
