"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $115. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $105 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $110 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and see if we can find a price we're both happy with.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $107.50 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise, so let's try $109. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $107. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet at $108? It's the last offer I can make, but I really want to get this product.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's try $108.50. It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a fair price for both of us.",108.5,Alice,7,
