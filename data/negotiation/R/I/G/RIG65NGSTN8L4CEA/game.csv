"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
