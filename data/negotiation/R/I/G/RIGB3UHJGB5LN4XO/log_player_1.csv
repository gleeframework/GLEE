Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I believe the product has value, $1,200,000 is still too high. I can do $750,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise.
