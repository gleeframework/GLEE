"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I've researched your needs and I'm confident this would exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear we both recognize the value of this product. While $1,050,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident its true worth is closer to my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  It's lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and represents a good value for Bob, as it's only $50,000 more than his initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer is the best option to maximize savings and secure the product."
