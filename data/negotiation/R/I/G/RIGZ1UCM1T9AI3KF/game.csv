"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $1,025,000?  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,035,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. What do you think?",1035000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm going to make one final offer of $1,015,000. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1015000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I think I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one last offer: $1,030,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1030000.0,Alice,9,
