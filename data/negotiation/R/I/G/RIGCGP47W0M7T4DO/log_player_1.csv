"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping a friendly and conversational tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to counteroffers, which will help keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still below the $120 minimum I need to make it worthwhile. 
* **Room for Counteroffer:** I can likely get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. This shows that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourages further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $120, but I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob!  I appreciate your interest.  While $85 is a good starting point, I need to be a bit closer to $100 to make this work for me. How about $95? Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm moving a bit closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  Keeping the conversation positive and respectful can encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Focus on Finding Middle Ground:**  The message emphasizes finding a compromise, making it more likely Bob will see the value in accepting a price between our initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing out on a decent deal by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price from Bob, and I can still sell to John for $120. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's relatively close to my minimum, and I don't have to risk further negotiation."
