Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that will undoubtedly provide substantial returns."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to an even higher final price.
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message highlights the product's benefits and long-term value to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 gives me leverage in negotiations. I'm not desperate, so I can confidently aim high with Bob."
