**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his final offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to bridge the gap and carries the risk of losing John's offer.  Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
