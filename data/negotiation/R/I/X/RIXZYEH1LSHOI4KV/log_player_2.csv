"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $850,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better than $850,000, especially since he has a backup option of buying from John for $800,000.  By rejecting, Bob can start a negotiation process and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on this product. Let's meet in the middle.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and ensures that we both get a good deal.
