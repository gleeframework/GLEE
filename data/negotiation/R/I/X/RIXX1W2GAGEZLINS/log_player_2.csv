"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than your maximum price of $12,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price from Alice.  Accepting her offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
