(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject her offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice may be willing to come down in price, or you can always buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am trying to secure a good deal.  It's a starting point for negotiation and allows space for potential compromise."

```

**Reasoning:**
