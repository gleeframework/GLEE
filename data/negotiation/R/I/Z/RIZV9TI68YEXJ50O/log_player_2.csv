"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal for a product worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I know I can get it for $12,000 from John, and Alice is likely willing to go lower. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'd consider a ""great deal.""  Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the price higher with her ""splitting the difference"" tactic. We're getting close to my limit, but I think one more counteroffer is worth the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $10,900.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 10900
}
```"
