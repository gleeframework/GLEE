"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it will be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  Could you possibly do $10,500?  I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
