You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.  It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, as you could potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower offer of $14,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still within the realm of possibility given that the product is worth $15,000 to her. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice in the hopes of getting a better price, especially since John is a backup option at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $14,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise. It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it's appealing enough for Alice to accept."
