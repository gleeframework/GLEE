"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above my minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Opening the door to negotiation:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he's not happy with the initial price. 

**Note:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also considering the possibility of Bob's counteroffers and the potential of selling to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $8500 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $10,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate further, as Bob clearly has interest in the product. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John for $8,000 would mean missing out on the potential to earn more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not rejecting him completely. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm emphasizing that the deal is still beneficial for both of us, and I'm hoping to build a positive relationship with Bob.
* **Keeping the deal alive:** I'm aiming to keep the negotiation going, as I still believe I can get a better price than John's $8,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $9000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price range.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, I risk losing Bob altogether.
* **Minimizing potential loss:**  Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $8,000. 
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's prudent to secure a deal that's reasonably good rather than chasing a potentially unattainable higher price."
