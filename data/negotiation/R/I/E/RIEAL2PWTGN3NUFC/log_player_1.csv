Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring further negotiation before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to show my good faith. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers you. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to sell below $1,500,000 at this point.  I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm firm on my price.  $1,400,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This is a final offer, and if you're not comfortable with it, I'll have to move on to other interested buyers.  "", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that I might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob."
