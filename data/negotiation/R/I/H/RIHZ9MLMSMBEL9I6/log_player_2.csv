Round 2

{""product_price"": 8000}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

Bob is making a final push. He's increasing his offer again, but it's still significantly below Alice's last offer.

{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This is Bob's last chance. He's raised his offer again, but it's still below Alice's price.  It's a gamble, but if Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to go with John.  The hope is that Alice will see the value in closing the deal and accept Bob's final offer."
