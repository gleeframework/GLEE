"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, but still reflects the product's value to me. I'm also leaving myself room to consider John's offer of $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's also closer to my minimum value for the product, while still being significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to see if I can get him to go a little higher. It's still too early to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  We are getting close to the halfway point of the negotiations, so I need to start considering John's offer, but I'm going to see if I can get Bob to move a little more first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is close to John's offer, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move a little higher.  We have a few rounds left, and I'm still hopeful I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11,750}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,750. This is a smaller compromise than my previous offer, but it's a move towards Bob's offer and signals that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also above John's offer, so I'm still getting a better price than selling to him.  With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this offer will be enough to get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Even though it's only $750 above John's offer, it's still better than selling to him. We are running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely."
