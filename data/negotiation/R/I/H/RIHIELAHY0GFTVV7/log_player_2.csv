"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I propose we strike a deal that benefits both of us. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is higher than your maximum budget of $100. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100.

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
