"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? ",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $912,500? This would give us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",912500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $912,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch outside my budget. How about we settle on $890,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",890000.0,Bob,4,
