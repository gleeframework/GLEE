"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its high value and potential impact on your business, I'm offering it to you at an exclusive price of $11,000. This represents a significant saving compared to the market value of $12,000, making it a compelling opportunity for you. I trust that this investment will pay off handsomely for you. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is overpriced:**  She's trying to create a sense of urgency and value by inflating the ""market value"" to $12,000. You know you can get it for $12,000 from John.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're a savvy buyer and open up the possibility of a counter-offer.  Alice might be willing to go lower to make the sale."
