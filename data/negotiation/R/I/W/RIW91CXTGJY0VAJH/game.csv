"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $14000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13500. It's a great compromise, considering its value to me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13000? I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we work together.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll meet you at $13000, but I need to make a small adjustment to my price. I'll sell the product to you for $13250. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for me.
