"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $11500 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal!",12500.0,Alice,5,
