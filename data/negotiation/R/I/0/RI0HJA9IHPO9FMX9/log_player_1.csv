Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $95 is still below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm sure we can both agree that this is a fair price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 102.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but unfortunately, I still can't meet the price. Would you be willing to lower it to $97? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $97 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price.  I've only got 6 rounds left, and I'm worried that I might end up with a price I'm not comfortable with if I keep negotiating.  It's better to sell to John now and get my guaranteed $100."
