"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm sure we can both agree that this is a fair price for such a valuable product.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but unfortunately, I still can't meet the price. Would you be willing to lower it to $97? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",97.0,Bob,4,
