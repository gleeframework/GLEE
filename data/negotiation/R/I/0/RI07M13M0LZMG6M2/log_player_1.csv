{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** It's crucial to stay above your $12,000 minimum. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're still likely to make more than selling to John.

This offer aims to strike a balance between attractiveness to Bob and ensuring a profitable outcome for you."
