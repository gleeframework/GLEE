"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $14,000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
