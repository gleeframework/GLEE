Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in purchasing, but would need a price closer to $150 to make it work for me.  Let's find a price that's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
