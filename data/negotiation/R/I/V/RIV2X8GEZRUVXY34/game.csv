"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in its field. I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $750000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value and the market conditions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering it to you for $810000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $810000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $780000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering it to you for $820000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but $820000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering $800500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",800500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $820000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering it to you for $810000. This is my final offer.",810000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I've already made a significant concession by offering $800500 in the previous round. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm willing to accept the product for $800500. This is my final offer.",800500.0,Bob,10,
