Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price in this range could theoretically work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but within reason:** $1,450,000 is close to your minimum but leaves room for Bob to feel like he got a slight deal.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair offer"" project value.
* **Focus on Benefits:**  Don't dwell on price alone. Remind Bob of the ""significant benefits"" the product offers.

**Important Notes**

* **Be prepared to negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to stand firm or consider a small concession if needed.
* **Don't reveal John:**  Knowing you have another buyer weakens your position."
