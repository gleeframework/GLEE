Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, leaving room for potential profit. However, it's not an outrageous price that would likely scare Bob away. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize my profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If he does reject, I still have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000."
