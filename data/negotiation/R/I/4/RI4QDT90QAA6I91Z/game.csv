"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a very unique and valuable product. I believe it holds tremendous potential for you, but I understand it's a significant investment.  My initial offer is $1500000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This reflects the value I believe the product holds for you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the negotiation thus far, I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you, while keeping within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
