Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I recognize its value, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
