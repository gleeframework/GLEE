"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a great compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
