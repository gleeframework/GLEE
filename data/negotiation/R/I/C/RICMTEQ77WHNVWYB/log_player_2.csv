"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a great compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're on a budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I still need to prioritize my profit margin. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $975,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $975,000.  While getting the product for a bit less than $975,000 would be ideal, John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice when I can secure the product for a known price from John."
