Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and could benefit you greatly. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below this would be leaving money on the table. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's unlikely he'll accept immediately, but it keeps the door open for a deal above $800,000. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase at $1,000,000."
