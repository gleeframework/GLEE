"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $850000 is still a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $925000 to make it worth my while. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $887500. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $887500 is enough to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $912500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the value it brings to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer $900000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the value it brings to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $900000, but I need to get a guarantee that you'll accept this price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000, but I need you to commit to the sale and sign a non-binding agreement. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to lose patience, Bob. I've made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $900000. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $895000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",895000.0,Alice,9,
