"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $95. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if it's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $95 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $90 just yet. I'm willing to make another counteroffer at $92.50. It's a slight concession, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if it's something you'd be interested in.",92.5,Alice,5,
