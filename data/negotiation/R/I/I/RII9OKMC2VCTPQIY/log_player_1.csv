I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it above John's offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $90 is better than $80, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  John offers me a guaranteed $150, which is a much better deal.  I'm going to sell to John."
