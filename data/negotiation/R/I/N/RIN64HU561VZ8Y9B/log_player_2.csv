"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  This leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still within Bob's budget and lower than John's price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject the counteroffer and Bob might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point, as it secures the product for a price that's both affordable and saves money compared to John."
