"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but it's still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to make a higher profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and even lower than selling to John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is still fair considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's work out a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000 at this point.  I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price.  If not, selling to John is still a safe option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
