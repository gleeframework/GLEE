"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000, a price that reflects the product's quality and potential. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but you want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value to me and the market price, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $950,000 is still a bit high. There's still room for negotiation, and you're likely to get a better deal if you keep pushing.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but you want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the market rate.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
