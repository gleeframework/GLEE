Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer was already quite reasonable. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I can go above that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting his offer gives me a $200,000 profit over my alternative (selling to John).  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely.
