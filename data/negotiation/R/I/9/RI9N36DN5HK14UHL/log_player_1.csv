Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at Bob's maximum value ($80) or your minimum ($120) leaves no room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($119) might entice Bob while still ensuring a profit if he accepts.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while having the security of John's offer."
