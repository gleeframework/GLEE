Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell the product, $1,400,000 is too far below my minimum threshold. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

You have three options:

Bob's offer is still too low, even with his attempt to meet in the middle. I'm not willing to risk further negotiations and risk ending up with less than my minimum price.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value for the product."
