Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that John will pay that much. This gives Bob a clear understanding of my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a price of $11,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for a big discount."
