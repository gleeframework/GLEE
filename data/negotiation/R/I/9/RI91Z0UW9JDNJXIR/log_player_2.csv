"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I understand its worth to you is higher, so I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to negotiate a higher price, her offer of $1,400,000 is still less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you money."
