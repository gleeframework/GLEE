"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $115 if you're willing to negotiate further.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $130? I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",125.0,Bob,4,
