"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  It's a fair price for a product you'll get so much value from.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can work something out.",10200.0,Bob,4,
