Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is still higher than Bob's offer of $90, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping this compromise will be appealing enough to Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $95 isn't terrible. However, with John willing to pay $100, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  I'm choosing to sell to John for a guaranteed $100 profit."
