"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While that price is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,250,000 remains below its worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,750,000?  This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
