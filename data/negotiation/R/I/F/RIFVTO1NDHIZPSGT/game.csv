"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your enthusiasm for the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm still confident this product is worth more to you than that. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $90. I'd be willing to meet you at $87.50. That's the highest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet. $87.50 is close, but it's still below my minimum.  How about we settle at $89?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $88. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",88.0,Bob,6,
