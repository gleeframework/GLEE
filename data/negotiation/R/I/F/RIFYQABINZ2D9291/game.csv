"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not sure I'm willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,600,000. It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to make a profit.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. $1,450,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not convinced it's the right price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,600,000 was too low, so I'll meet you in the middle of that and your last offer. How about $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,550,000 is closer, I'm still  just a bit over budget.  Let's try $1,500,000. This would be a win-win, allowing you to make a fair profit while staying within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
