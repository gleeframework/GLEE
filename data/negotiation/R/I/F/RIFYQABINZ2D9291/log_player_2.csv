Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a better price."

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,600,000 was too low, so I'll meet you in the middle of that and your last offer.

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my desired price point. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
