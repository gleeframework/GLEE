,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $7,500?  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
