"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $7,500?  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is still a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. Since I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $8,000, I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go, and it would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly what John is willing to pay.  Since I am aiming to maximize my profit, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price."
