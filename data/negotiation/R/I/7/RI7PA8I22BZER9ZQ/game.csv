"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, considering my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a fair compromise. This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I am still not able to meet at $975,000. I would like to propose $960,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,
