"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a bit more than what you're willing to sell it for, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $8750? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
