Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Initial Price:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a substantial profit. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" introduces a subtle sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly if he's interested.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it doesn't eliminate the possibility of Bob negotiating a lower price, still potentially above your minimum.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while acknowledging the information you have about both Bob and John's valuations."
