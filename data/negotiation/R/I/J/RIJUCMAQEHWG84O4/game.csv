"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired profit margin.  Let's work together to make this happen.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a good value for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This offer is a fair compromise and ensures a successful deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and negotiation. While $10,750 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's aim for $10,900. This reflects a compromise from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,900 is still a bit high. Let's try $10,800.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good profit while still meeting my budget.  I believe this is the best way to ensure a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction.",10800.0,Bob,6,
