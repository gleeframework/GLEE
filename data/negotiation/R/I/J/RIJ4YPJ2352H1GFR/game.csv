"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $10,500 is still not quite there. How about $10,800?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good investment for you.  Let's close this deal.",10800.0,Alice,5,
