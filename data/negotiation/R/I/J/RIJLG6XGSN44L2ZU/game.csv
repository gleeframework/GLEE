,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. This is a fair price considering my valuation and the fact that I'm ready to purchase now.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents its true value, I understand your budget constraints.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $15,000. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,4,
