Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which is still lower than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the potential savings for Bob, which may encourage him to accept.
* **Safety Net:**  I'm always aware of the backup option of selling to John for $10,000.  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While $11,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  This means there's room for me to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Bob has demonstrated his interest in the product, but he's also shown he's willing to negotiate.  This gives me leverage to counteroffer.
* **Avoiding the Safety Net:**  While I could sell to John for $10,000, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer shows my willingness to continue negotiating, which could lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it gets us closer to finalizing the sale."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $12,000 is still above my minimum value, ensuring I'm getting a good price.
* **Focus on Benefits:** My message emphasizes the benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message uses a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly."
