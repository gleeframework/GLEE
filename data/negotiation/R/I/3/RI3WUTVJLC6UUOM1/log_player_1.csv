"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum of $800,000.  I'll be keeping a close eye on Bob's reaction and John's offer as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $920,000, we're only halfway through the negotiations, and I believe there's still room for improvement. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm going to counter with $940,000. This is a smaller adjustment than before, showing Bob I'm serious about closing the deal but still want a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've gone back and forth a few times, and $930,000 is a good price, especially considering we're in the middle of the negotiations. While I'd prefer to push for a bit more, there's always the risk that Bob will reject my next offer, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with John's lower offer."
