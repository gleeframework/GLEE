"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget and there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before potentially settling with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between Alice's value and my maximum. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but still leaves room for compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate with Alice. I'm not yet ready to settle with John as I still have several rounds left to potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm willing to move a little, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal range. It's a more modest increase than Alice's reduction, signaling my desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reduced her price to $1,020,000. While this is still higher than my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer.  With only five rounds left, it's increasingly risky to continue negotiating. If I reject this offer, there's a chance Alice might increase her price again, or I might fail to reach an agreement with her altogether.  Considering that John's price is $1,200,000, accepting this offer will save me $180,000."
