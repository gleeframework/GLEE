"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. Let's meet in the middle! ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108. If you're not willing to budge, I'll need to consider buying from John.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer. While I value our negotiation,  $108 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $109? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $109 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $107. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $107 is still below my minimum. Let's try $108. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",108.0,Alice,7,
