``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I've included a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold, but I am confident I can get a better price through further negotiations. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 3

I'm counter-offering at $110, which is still above my minimum threshold and closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108. If you're not willing to budge, I'll need to consider buying from John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer. While I value our negotiation,  $108 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $109? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 109} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's last offer, hoping to show that I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum threshold. I've also emphasized the fairness of the offer to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $109 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $107. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.

Round 7
