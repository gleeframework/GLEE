"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high, but I believe I can negotiate a better price. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I still think we can find a price closer to my initial offer. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $10,750. It's a good compromise and closer to what this product is worth. What do you say? ",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose $10,500. This seems to be a reasonable compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,
