"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate at that price.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $15,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
