{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll agree!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $120.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation and potential for a win-win.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message conveys your willingness to discuss price, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is your minimum, Bob's offer is right at that minimum, leaving no room for profit.  It's worth trying to push for a higher price.  You can likely get a better offer by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. While $120 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come up a bit to $125 to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $115 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering less than your minimum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $120, ensuring you at least meet your minimum profit goal.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better price."
