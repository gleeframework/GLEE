Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $140. This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's perceived value of $150 but above my minimum of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $140.  I'll counter with a price closer to that in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept, while still allowing me to get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and still gives me a decent profit.  It's also likely that if I reject, Bob might walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for a lower price."
