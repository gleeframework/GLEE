Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This is a good starting point.  It's above your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation, and it's a bit below Bob's maximum value, making it attractive for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still below what the product is worth to Bob, but higher than his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate for a sale."
