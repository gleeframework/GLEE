# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.
