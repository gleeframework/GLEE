"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  Could you consider something closer to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
