"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and hopefully, we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop my price to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to budge a bit, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,075,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Let's try $1,125,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
