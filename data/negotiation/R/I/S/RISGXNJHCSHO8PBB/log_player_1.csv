Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

I'm still not willing to accept Bob's offer. I'm closer to my desired price, but I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise.  I still have the option to sell to John for my desired price if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop my price to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to keep pushing for a price closer to my desired value. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can get Bob to pay closer to $1,200,000.  If not, I can always go to John and get my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to budge a bit, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,075,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Let's try $1,125,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 8

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've only got two rounds left, and I'm not confident that Bob will come up to my desired price. I've made multiple concessions, but Bob's offers are still too low. It's better to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
