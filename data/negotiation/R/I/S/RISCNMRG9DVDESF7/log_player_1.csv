Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification for Value:**  The message hints at the product's value but doesn't give away specifics. This encourages Bob to engage in further conversation if he's interested. 
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values it at $800,000, aiming for $1,200,000 allows room for potential profit while still being within a range Bob might consider.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. If Bob rejects the offer outright, you'll have to settle for the guaranteed $800,000 from John. However, the potential for a significantly higher sale price to Bob makes this risk worth taking."
