Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'll then assess Bob's counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to receive. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This will keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering a price that's still a good deal for me while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would like to get a higher price, Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum. It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get my desired minimum and avoids further negotiation."
