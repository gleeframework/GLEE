Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $8,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get a significantly better deal. I'm choosing to sell to John for $8,000, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
