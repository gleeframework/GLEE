"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's worth a lot more than that to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. While $11,000 is better, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $10,750?  It's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",10750.0,Bob,4,
