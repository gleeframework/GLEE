"Alice, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
