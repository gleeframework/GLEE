"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,075,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $1,060,000? ",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a lower price. However, $1,060,000 is still below what I can accept. Let's try $1,065,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, and it's still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think.",1065000.0,Alice,5,
