{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offers are starting to feel a bit unreasonable. We're not going to give in to her demands, but we're also not going to risk buying from John at a higher price. We're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, so we need to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

Let's make a final push towards our target price. This offer is a significant compromise from our last counteroffer, but it's still a decent price. We're hoping Alice will realize that we're serious about buying and she needs to be more flexible."

We're running out of time, and Alice is clearly not budging. It's better to go with John's offer. It's not our ideal price, but we've exhausted all options with Alice. It's time to secure the product before we lose it altogether."
