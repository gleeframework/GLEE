Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,700,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a drastic reduction.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $800,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of your product, I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us. Considering my budget constraints, would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still far below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting.  I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired value, but also recognizes Bob's budget limitations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer considers your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I believe a fair price for your product would be $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are not progressing towards a price I'm comfortable with. While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 

Given that I can get a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to him.  It's more important for me to reach my minimum price than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with a lower offer."
