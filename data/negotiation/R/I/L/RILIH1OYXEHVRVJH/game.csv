"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $11,000?  I'm confident we can close a deal at this price, and it's still a fair offer for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $11,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to close this deal, I'm confident we can find common ground.",11250.0,Alice,5,
