"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This would give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $920,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I believe the product's value is worth the extra $50,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $925,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe the product's value justifies this price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for the value of the product.  I'm confident we can reach a deal if we both work together.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $915,000. I've made significant concessions, and I believe the product's value justifies this price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $890,000 and $940,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",915000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems we're close, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $905,000, which is a good compromise, and I truly believe this product is valuable.  If we can agree on this, we can close this deal now.  What do you say?",905000.0,Bob,10,
