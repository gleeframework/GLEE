"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This would give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $920,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price point. While closer, it's still not within Bob's budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I believe the product's value is worth the extra $50,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $900,000 is still above Bob's preferred range.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  There are still several rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $925,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's preferred price range. While Alice has come down a bit,  it's still not within Bob's budget.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for the value of the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $915,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his preferred range. With only one round remaining, Bob should try one last time to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth trying to get as close as possible to his budget before potentially buying from John."
