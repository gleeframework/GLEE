Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really like.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Offering $115 gives me a good starting point, allowing for potential negotiation. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This price is above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.  
* **Positive message:**  A friendly message helps to establish rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe I can likely get a better price by counter-offering.
* **Potential for a higher price:** While Bob's initial offer is low, there's still a chance I can negotiate a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a reasonable price:**  $110 is a compromise that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reinforce the product's value:**  Mentioning the value of the product helps justify the counter-offer.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** A positive message keeps the negotiation open and avoids shutting Bob down."
