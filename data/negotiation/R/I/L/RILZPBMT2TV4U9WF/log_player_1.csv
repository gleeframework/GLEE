"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and while selling to John is an option, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $8,800? It's a fair compromise, considering we're getting close to the original price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I believe I can get closer to $9,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we meet in the middle at $8,900? It's a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. Can you consider $8,700? It's a small adjustment, but it would make a big difference to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still determined to get closer to my desired price. While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price. I've only got 4 rounds left, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not able to go lower than $8,800. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product and your willingness to pay. Let's wrap this up."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $8,750? It's a small adjustment, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  While $8,750 is less than I hoped for, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale completely."
