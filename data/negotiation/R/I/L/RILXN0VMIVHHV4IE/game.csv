"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This price is fair, considering its value to you.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me and your own valuation, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me. Considering the product's value to you and my own investment, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's reach an agreement.  ",950000.0,Alice,3,
