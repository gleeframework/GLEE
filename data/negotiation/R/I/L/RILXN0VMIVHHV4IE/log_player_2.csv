"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This price is fair, considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above the product's value to you ($1,200,000). You have room to negotiate and try to lower the price further. You can reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me and your own valuation, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me. Considering the product's value to you and my own investment, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's reach an agreement.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. Accepting this offer allows you to save $250,000 compared to buying from John. While there might be potential for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John or having the negotiations drag on for longer outweighs the potential gain from a slightly lower price."
