"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it. ",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit over my budget at $10,800.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $10,500. This is my final offer. Let me know if we can come to an agreement. ",10500.0,Alice,5,
