Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $8500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for that low just yet. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  How about $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. Would $8750 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $8,750 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm happy to accept Bob's offer."
