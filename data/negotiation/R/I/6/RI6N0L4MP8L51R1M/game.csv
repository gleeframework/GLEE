"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a steal, considering its value! Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in this product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 still isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price considering the product's value.  This is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $90, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",90.0,Bob,6,
