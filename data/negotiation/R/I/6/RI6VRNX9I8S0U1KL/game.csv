"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $9500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10250?  That way, we both get a fair price.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product today.",10000.0,Bob,4,
