Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $1,115,000. This is a significant discount for me, and I truly believe it's a fair offer given the value the product holds for you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1115000}

This is getting frustrating. Bob isn't budging and we're running out of time. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than settling for less."
