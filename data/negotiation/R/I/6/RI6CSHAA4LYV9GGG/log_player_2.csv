Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,500,000. I know this is a premium over your stated valuation, but I believe the true value of this product will become clear as we discuss further.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your perspective, but $800,000 is considerably below what I can consider.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position and appreciate you coming up to $1,000,000.  I've been very flexible throughout this process to get a deal done. To be entirely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000 that I need to consider. However, I value the discussions we've had and would much rather work with you. If you're able to move up slightly, I'm confident we can close this today.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at her valuation of $1,200,000.  She's even revealed she has another offer at that price.  It's highly unlikely she'll go below this. Since you have a standing offer from John for $1,000,000 and that's your maximum, it's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure the deal with John."
