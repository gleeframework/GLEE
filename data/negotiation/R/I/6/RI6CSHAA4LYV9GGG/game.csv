"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,500,000. I know this is a premium over your stated valuation, but I believe the true value of this product will become clear as we discuss further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. I believe that's a fair starting point that reflects its worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your perspective, but $800,000 is considerably below what I can consider.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground.  $1,350,000 is still a significant jump from my initial offer. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate a fair deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving up on price. It shows you're serious. However, there's still a substantial gap between our positions.  To bridge this, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. While $1,275,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Let's make this simple â€“ I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This represents my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a very fair offer given the market and the value this product holds for me. Let me know if you're agreeable.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position and appreciate you coming up to $1,000,000.  I've been very flexible throughout this process to get a deal done. To be entirely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000 that I need to consider. However, I value the discussions we've had and would much rather work with you. If you're able to move up slightly, I'm confident we can close this today.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
