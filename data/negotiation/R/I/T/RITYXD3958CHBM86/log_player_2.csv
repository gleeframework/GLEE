"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the negotiation much lower. While $65 is unlikely to be accepted, it leaves significant room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a significant improvement from the initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to the $80 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle on $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer ($90) and my previous offer ($65). This shows a willingness to negotiate but also keeps me moving towards my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $85. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm willing to see if I can get her down to $80.  There's no rush to accept $85 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. How about we make it a deal at $80 even? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This is my final offer and matches what John is offering.  It's important to be firm here. I'm willing to walk away if Alice doesn't accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $80. I'll meet you at $87.50. It's a fair price for a high-quality product like this, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and I'm not getting a better deal than John's offer. It's time to walk away and buy from John."
