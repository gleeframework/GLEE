"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still significantly lower than what I had in mind.  This product is truly worth it, and I could easily sell it for at least $12,000 to someone else.  How about we settle for $11,500? It's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your position, but I believe $11,500 is still too high for me. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product, which is closer to its value to me. Would you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
