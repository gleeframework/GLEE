Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I also have to consider my own needs and make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $800,000. Let's aim for a compromise. My counteroffer is $950,000.

While $950,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll try to negotiate further."

That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $920,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice is not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  Even though I'm interested in the product, I'd rather buy from John at $800,000 to save money."
