# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John at the lower price."
