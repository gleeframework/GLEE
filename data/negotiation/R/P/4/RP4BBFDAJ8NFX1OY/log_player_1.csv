"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential,"" I'm aiming to frame the price in terms of its benefits, potentially shifting Bob's focus away from his initial valuation.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the product's worth can influence Bob's perception of its value. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation and assessing Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still acknowledging Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is substantial and I can't part with it for less than $1,200,000. This is a adjusted price that reflects the unique benefits you'll gain.  I'm confident it's a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement:**  I begin by acknowledging Bob's offer and constraints, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's high value, subtly anchoring Bob's perception above his initial $800,000.
* **Strategic Reduction:**  My counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial price, but still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum.  This signals flexibility while holding firm on a profitable outcome. 
* **Confidence:** I maintain a confident tone to influence Bob's perception of the deal's fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation rounds won't yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
