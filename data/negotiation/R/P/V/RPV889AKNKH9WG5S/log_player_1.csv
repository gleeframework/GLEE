"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's great to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"",
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

* **Start High, but Be Realistic:** I'm aiming close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer is as much about understanding Bob's willingness to pay as it is about securing an immediate agreement.
* **Alternative Option in Mind:**  I know I have John as a backup at $800,000, giving me a safety net and leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $950,000 is a significant profit, it's a considerable drop from my initial ask. Accepting now leaves a lot of potential money on the table.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's message indicates willingness to negotiate.  His counteroffer wasn't insulting, suggesting he's seriously interested. 
* **Backup Provides Leverage:** Knowing I have John's offer allows me to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $950,000 undervalues it.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
 ""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I've come down by $50,000 from my initial offer, signaling flexibility.  This counteroffer is slightly closer to my original price, aiming for a middle ground that still yields a substantial profit.
* **Strong Value Statement:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price without being overly aggressive.
* **Testing the Waters:** This round will give me a clearer indication of Bob's true willingness to pay and help me decide my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would allow us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,000,000 is a fantastic profit margin, well above my minimum acceptable price and a significant gain from John's offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's suggestion to ""split the difference"" demonstrates a willingness to be fair and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Dragging negotiations out longer carries the risk of Bob losing interest or finding alternatives. Accepting now secures a great deal quickly."
