"Hello Bob, it's great to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $950,000 undervalues it.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would allow us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
