Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **High but Justifiable:** $925,000 is a significant markup from your minimum, but still represents a substantial saving for Bob compared to his perceived value. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's decision.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome while keeping the fallback option (selling to John) in mind."
