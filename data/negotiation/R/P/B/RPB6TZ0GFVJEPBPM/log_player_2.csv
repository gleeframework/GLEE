"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price.  You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and you ending up buying from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings of a few thousand dollars.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a price within your budget, and you still save a substantial amount compared to John's price."
