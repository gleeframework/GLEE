{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than the product's worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a message that highlights the value of the product and positions the offer as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
