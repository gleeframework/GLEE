"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin with a price closer to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) than to your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer acknowledges that this is a starting point, implying flexibility and inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and emphasizing a collaborative approach to finding a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's too early to settle. There's still room to negotiate a better deal, especially since you have ample rounds remaining. Bob's message implies he's aware of the product's value, suggesting he might be willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential return on investment for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:**  Conceding slightly demonstrates willingness to negotiate but maintains a price significantly above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value proposition *specifically* to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Seeking a Compromise:** Framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This price reflects my budget and my expectations for the product's value. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend, Continued Potential:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating a willingness to move closer to your range.  It's still too early to settle, especially when he's phrasing his offer as ""meeting in the middle."" This suggests he's open to going higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While selling to John is always an option, accepting Bob's current offer means leaving potentially $50,000 or more on the table. The negotiation momentum suggests a higher profit is achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal and recognizes the value you see in the product."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Meeting Bob exactly in the middle of his latest offer and your previous one shows significant movement on your part, which can encourage him to reciprocate. 
* **Stronger Language:** Phrasing like ""it seems we're getting closer"" and ""my desire to make a deal"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency and encourages closure.
* **Profitable Outcome:** This price point still secures a $100,000 profit above your minimum, making it a favorable outcome if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking $1,275,000 is a fair price for the product. I believe it's a good compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit Margin:**  Bob's offer is now at $1,275,000, which is a $75,000 profit above your minimum. While there might be a slight possibility of squeezing a little more, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After six rounds, it's clear Bob is committed to a price in this vicinity. Continuing could lead to a stalemate or encourage him to lowball in later rounds.
* **Bird in Hand:** Accepting now secures a respectable profit. Delaying further and potentially losing Bob could result in having to settle for the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
