"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to get a good deal while still giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
