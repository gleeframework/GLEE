"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. Bob knows the product is valuable to him, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. I believe $1,600,000 is a fair price that balances my desire for a high sale with the potential for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $900,000 is still way too low.  I'm confident I can get more from Bob, or at least close to my minimum with John. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm taking a more significant step down, but still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer is a strong middle ground that might appeal to Bob while still being above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is getting closer to Bob's perceived value, I'm still far from my minimum price. I'm committed to getting closer to my goal, so I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that provides me with a profit. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price, and with only two rounds left, I risk getting nothing. John is guaranteed to buy at my minimum, so selling to him is the best option to secure a profitable deal."
