"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget.** You're looking to pay no more than $100, and $120 is outside of that.
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a price you're comfortable with. 
* **John is a backup option.**  If negotiations with Alice fall apart, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.**  You're trying to stay under $100, and $110 is still too high. 
* **You have a safe alternative.** Since John is willing to sell the product for $100, you don't need to settle for a price higher than that. 
* **Further negotiation is possible.** You can try to counteroffer again, maybe at $105, and see if you can close the deal closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little too high. Would you be willing to come down to $105? That's the absolute maximum I can afford to pay."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $105. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $108? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll still get a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** You're aiming for $100 or less, and $108 is too high.
* **You have a better option.** John is offering the same product for $100, making him the better deal at this point.
* **Negotiation is likely to continue.**  While you could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  You risk wasting more time and potentially getting stuck with a price you don't want."
