"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1600000 for this product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1600000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1800000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1700000.  This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $1700000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1700000, which is $1750000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort, but $1750000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1725000. If this isn't acceptable, I might need to consider other options.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $1725000, but I need to get a bit more out of this deal. How about we do $1725000, but I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services for the next 6 months, which would normally cost $75000? That way, you'll get a better value for your money.",1725000.0,Alice,7,
