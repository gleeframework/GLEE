Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product significantly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, it allows for some potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly.
* **Alternative Option:** The safety net of John's offer allows for a strong starting point in negotiations.

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of realism, increasing the chances of a successful and profitable sale."
