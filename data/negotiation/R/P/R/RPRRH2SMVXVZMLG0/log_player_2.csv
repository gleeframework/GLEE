"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than the $1,000,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows Alice's minimum price is $800,000. Offering $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation while still being within Bob's budget. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is closer to her original offer than Bob's counteroffer, and still above Bob's desired price.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal. While John is an option, Bob should continue to see if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer but is still trying to get a lower price than Alice's last offer. $900,000 is a middle ground, showing that Bob is serious about the deal but still wants a good price. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and could lead to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $960,000 is only $10,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer, and it's within Bob's budget. It's a better deal than buying from John and continuing to negotiate may not yield much more savings.  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer seems like a reasonable decision to secure the product at a fair price."
