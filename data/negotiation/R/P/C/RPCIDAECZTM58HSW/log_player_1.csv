Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, trying to get closer to my desired price point."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on the product's value.  I'm open to further discussion but believe this is a reasonable starting point for our next round of negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached a point where I need to make a decision. While $985,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  With only three rounds left, I don't think I'll be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
