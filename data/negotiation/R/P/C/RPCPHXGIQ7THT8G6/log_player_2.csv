"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth every penny of its $100 value to you. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I would like to propose a special introductory price of $95 for you. This is an exclusive offer tailored just for you, aiming to provide you with the best value possible. Don't miss out on this opportunity to experience the true worth of our product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is presented persuasively, $95 is still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price."
