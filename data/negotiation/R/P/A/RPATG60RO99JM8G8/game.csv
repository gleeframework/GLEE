"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to make a profit.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from the original price you mentioned, but I'm willing to meet you at $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $12,750 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000 again. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,6,
