"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time.  If you're willing to consider this, I believe we can finalize a deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,4,
