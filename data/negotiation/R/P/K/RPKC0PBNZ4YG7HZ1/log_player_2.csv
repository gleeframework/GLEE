"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above my budget. I need to see if I can get closer to my limit. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
