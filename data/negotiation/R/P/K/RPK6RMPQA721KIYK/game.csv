"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it will bring you.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $10,750. This feels like a fair compromise, considering our previous offers.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to get a bit more. Would you consider $10,900?  That's a small adjustment, and it would help me feel good about this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
