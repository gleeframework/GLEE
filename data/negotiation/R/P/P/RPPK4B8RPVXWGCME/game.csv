"I'm interested in the product, but $1150000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1000000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1075000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1075000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000 for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1050000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again?  I'm willing to go down to $1062500. It's only a small adjustment, but it would make a significant difference for me. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement in this round.",1062500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1062500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
