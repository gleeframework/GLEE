"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential compromise. It also sets a positive tone by expressing belief in a fair price, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1150000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I want to try and push for a higher price, even if it means potentially going a few more rounds.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that splits the difference, and see if I can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,075,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1075000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not entirely satisfied. I'm going to push for a little more and see if I can get him to budge further. I have a few rounds left and the risk of selling to John is still present."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again?  I'm willing to go down to $1,062,500. It's only a small adjustment, but it would make a significant difference for me. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1062500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum with Bob's offer, but there are only four rounds left.  The risk of not getting a better price is becoming too high. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000.  This ensures I still get a decent return on my product, and minimizes the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
