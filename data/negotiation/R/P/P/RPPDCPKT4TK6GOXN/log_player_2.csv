"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500?  It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price for Bob considering he's willing to pay up to $12,000.  There's still room for negotiation, but it's risky to keep going and risk Alice getting frustrated and sticking to her price or even going back up.  Accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids potential delays."
