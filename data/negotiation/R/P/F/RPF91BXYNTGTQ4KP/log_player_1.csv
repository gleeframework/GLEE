"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing its exact worth to you. This helps justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is friendly and invites Bob's feedback, indicating willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and the product's value to him.  While you want to earn as much as possible, accepting such a low offer in Round 2 would be premature. It's better to counter-offer and try to negotiate a better deal. You have plenty of room to work with before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  You're lowering your initial price, signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate.
* **But Stand Firm:** The counter-offer is still significantly above Bob's offer, emphasizing that you believe in the product's higher value. 
* **Justification:**  You're re-emphasizing the product's ""potential,"" subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" can encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet halfway at $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting now secures you a good deal and avoids the potential of losing out on both Bob and John."
