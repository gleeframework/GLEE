"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to counter with a price lower than your actual upper limit. This leaves room for negotiation and compromise.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses interest while firmly stating my budget limitations. 
* **Targeting Alice's Value:**  By offering $100, I'm aiming to buy the product at Alice's perceived value. While she may not accept immediately, it's a strong starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting me in the middle.  $105 is a reasonable price, saving me $15 off my initial limit and representing a fair compromise. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price."
