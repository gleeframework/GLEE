# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
