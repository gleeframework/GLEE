"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the immense benefits it holds for you. What are your thoughts?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget ($2,000,000 vs. my max of $1,200,000).  There's no way I'm accepting that.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I need to continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to my limit.  Buying from John is still an option, but I'm not ready to do that yet."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a solution.  However, $1,600,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.
