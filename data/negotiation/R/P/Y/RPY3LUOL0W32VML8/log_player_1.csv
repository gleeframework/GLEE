Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. We have plenty of room to negotiate and John is a good backup option."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.

You have three options:

We're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a significant way off from our minimum. We'll continue negotiating."

Round 5

We're still a significant amount away from our desired price. Bob is incrementing his offer slowly, and we're getting into the later rounds.  We need to signal we might walk away soon to encourage him to move closer to our price."
