{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in. I'm offering it to you for $115. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $115 is higher than $100, so he'll need to be convinced it's worth the extra cost.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $115 is still above your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially lower the price a bit if Bob pushes back, but still maintain a decent profit margin. 

Let me know how Bob responds and I'll help you strategize the next move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a decent amount, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since John is willing to pay $120, there's no reason to settle for less.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $110 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good move:

* **It's still above your minimum:** You're aiming for $120, so $105 is still a good profit.
* **It shows flexibility:** You've lowered your price from $115 to $105, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **It's a reasonable middle ground:**  You're offering a price halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer.

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer or if we need to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $102.50? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your target of $120. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, and you have the safety net of selling to John for $120 if you can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're doing your best to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit on this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $103.75? That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 103.75}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's still above your minimum:** You're aiming for $120, so $103.75 is still a decent profit.
* **It shows flexibility:** You've lowered your price from $105 to $103.75, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
* **It's a reasonable middle ground:** This offer is exactly halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer.

By continuing to negotiate and offering a fair compromise, you're increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement that works for both of you.  Let's see if Bob accepts this offer or if we need to go another round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm still a bit short, so I'll try to meet you in the middle again. How about we settle on $102.75? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $102.75 is close to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your target of $120. Since John is willing to pay $120, it's wiser to sell the product to him. There's a risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a price lower than $120, and you don't want to lose out on that guaranteed profit."
