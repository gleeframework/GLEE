"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in. I'm offering it to you for $115. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $110 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $102.50? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",102.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're doing your best to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit on this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $103.75? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",103.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm still a bit short, so I'll try to meet you in the middle again. How about we settle on $102.75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",102.75,Bob,6,
