Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $1,500,000, but lower than the product's worth to me. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  A high initial price lets me see if Bob is seriously interested in the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  By starting high, I have space to negotiate down if needed, potentially reaching a price closer to my goal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, I want to avoid using it unless absolutely necessary.  Negotiating with Bob gives me the potential for a higher profit.
* **Bob's negotiation style:**  I'll need to be flexible and adjust my strategy depending on how Bob responds. If he's aggressive, I may need to be more firm. If he's hesitant, I may need to lower the price more quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000 but it's still below what I ideally want.  I believe I can potentially get closer to my target by continuing the negotiation:

* **Potential for higher price:**  There's a chance I can convince Bob to pay more by making a counteroffer.
* **Testing Bob's limits:**  Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to see how committed he is to buying the product.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully consider my next counteroffer, keeping in mind:

* **Bob's maximum price:**  His offer suggests he's willing to pay up to $1,400,000.
* **My minimum acceptable price:**  I won't go below $1,500,000 without strong reason. 
* **The risk of losing Bob:**  If I push too hard, I risk losing Bob as a buyer.

**Important Note:**

While John's offer is a safety net, I'm still aiming for a higher price with Bob. I'll only resort to selling to John if the negotiations with Bob break down entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price of $1,550,000 to Bob.  Here's why:

* **Closer to my target:** This price is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which I'm hoping will make it more attractive to Bob. 
* **Testing Bob's commitment:**  I'm still testing Bob's willingness to pay, but I'm also demonstrating that I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Reasonable compromise:** This offer could be seen as a reasonable compromise between my desired price and Bob's last offer.

**Strategy for the next round:**

* **Accept if Bob agrees:**  If Bob accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a price closer to my target.
* **Counteroffer if Bob rejects:** If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and potentially offer a slightly lower price, but I'll be careful not to drop below my minimum.
* **Sell to John if negotiation fails:** If the negotiation with Bob breaks down, I'll sell to John to ensure a minimum profit. 

**The goal is to get as close to my desired price as possible while still securing a sale.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to avoid selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.

* **Risk of losing value:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean a significant loss compared to what the product is worth to me and what John is offering.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, even if it takes a few more rounds.
* **Demonstrating my position:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm firm in my value for the product and that I'm not willing to accept an unreasonable offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum.  I'll need to consider the following:

* **Bob's willingness to pay:** His offers suggest he might be willing to go up to $1,400,000. 
* **The risk of losing Bob:**  If I push too hard, I might lose him as a buyer entirely. 
* **John's offer:**  I will keep John's offer in mind as a backup option.

My goal remains to get as close to my target price as possible while still securing a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob $1,450,000. This is my final compromise before considering selling to John. Here's why:

* **Compromising, but not too much:**  I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing flexibility, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's last offer.
* **Pushing Bob's limits:** I'm testing Bob's willingness to pay a bit more while still leaving room for a potential counteroffer from him.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price with Bob. 

**Strategy for the next round:**

* **Accept if Bob agrees:**  If Bob accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a price that's reasonable and keeps me closer to my desired price. 
* **Sell to John if Bob rejects:**  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will sell the product to John to ensure a minimum profit and avoid further negotiation.

**Important Note:** I'm approaching a critical point in the negotiation. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but if Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to move on to the alternative option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This is the third time Bob has rejected my offers, demonstrating he's not willing to pay a price that's close to my value for the product. 

* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Further negotiations are unlikely to produce a price closer to my desired price.  The risk of continuing with Bob is that we could stall and ultimately result in a lower price than John's offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a significant profit and meets my minimum requirements.

**Decision:**

While I initially aimed to negotiate with Bob, his repeated rejection of my offers has made it clear that he is not a suitable buyer at this time.  Selling to John is the most sensible decision to ensure a quick and profitable transaction."
