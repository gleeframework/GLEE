"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1700000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. Can we discuss this price?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price reflects the value and potential of the product, and it's also a fair compromise. Let's make a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I'm getting a bit too low-balled by your offers. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we shake on it at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's shake on it.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go above $1400000. I'm willing to make one last offer at this price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. Can we do business at $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,8,
