Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he wouldn't logically pay more than that.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  Going too close to $1,500,000 risks him walking away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,350,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value.
* **Confidence:**  Framing it as a ""fair price"" and a ""worthwhile investment"" encourages Bob to see it positively.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob reacts will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate or walk away if he's unwilling to meet you close to your desired price.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  While you have John as a backup, mentioning other interested parties can sometimes create urgency and encourage Bob to act quickly."
