"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While I believe the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000?  That's a significant investment on my end, but one I'm willing to make if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
