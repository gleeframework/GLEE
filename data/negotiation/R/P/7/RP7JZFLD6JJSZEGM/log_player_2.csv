"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90, a special deal considering its high value. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $90 is less than your maximum budget of $100 and it's cheaper than buying from John for $100. This saves you money and gets you the product."
