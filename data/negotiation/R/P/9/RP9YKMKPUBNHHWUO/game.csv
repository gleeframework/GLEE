"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $8500 is your limit.  However, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9500 to make this deal work. This is a significant reduction from my initial price and reflects my desire to work with you. Let me know if this is acceptable.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your situation, but I can't go below $9200.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",9200.0,Alice,5,
