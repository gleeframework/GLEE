"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this excellent product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I think this is a fair starting point for a productive negotiation."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($2,000,000 vs. $1,200,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives us room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above our minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential gain, fostering a collaborative atmosphere. 
* **""Fair starting point"":** This language suggests willingness to negotiate while subtly implying the price is justified. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A quick counteroffer will indicate how eager Bob is to acquire the product.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our target and John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate and aim higher. Rejecting this offer signals we're looking for a more substantial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  To be frank, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and express willingness to find common ground, maintaining a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We drop $300,000, a significant amount, signaling flexibility.  However, we stay above John's offer and closer to our initial asking price.
* **""Meet in the middle"":**  This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to make a similar concession in return.

This counteroffer aims to:

1.  **Keep the negotiation moving:**  We avoid stagnation by presenting a revised offer.
2.  **Test Bob's upper limit:**  We need to gauge how high Bob is willing to go. This offer will provide valuable insight. 
3.  **Maintain a profitable position:**  We remain in a position to potentially secure a deal better than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  While we started higher, there's no guarantee we can push Bob further. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in subsequent rounds. 

Key takeaways:

* **Knowing your limits:** Having a firm walk-away point is crucial. 
* **Balancing ambition and pragmatism:**  We aimed high but recognized a good offer when presented.
* **Time value of money:**  Closing the deal now secures the funds instead of risking further negotiation."
