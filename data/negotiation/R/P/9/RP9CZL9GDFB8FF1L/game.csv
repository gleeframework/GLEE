"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this excellent product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I think this is a fair starting point for a productive negotiation.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  To be frank, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close the deal quickly.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
