"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $9,500. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($9,500 vs. $8,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a fallback option of buying from John for $10,000.** This gives you leverage to push for a lower price. 

By rejecting the initial offer, you can attempt to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We're offering a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also leaves some room for further discussion.
* **Fairness:** We're framing the offer as ""fair"" to both parties, aiming to build rapport and encourage a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still offering a price higher than the product's worth to her ($9,000 vs. $8,000).** This means there's likely more room to negotiate. 
* **You have a fallback option with John.** This gives you the security to keep pushing for a lower price.

By rejecting again, you can continue the negotiation and attempt to get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're offering a price that's halfway between our previous offer and Alice's last offer, showing we're serious about negotiating.
* **Fairness:**  We're again framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to build rapport and encourage a deal.
* **Reasoning:** We're providing a reason for the counteroffer to show we're not just throwing out numbers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. How about we meet at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than her stated minimum.**  While she's mentioning a minimum, she's not actually committed to it. 
* **You have a fallback option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept.** 
* **You're getting closer to your desired price.** By rejecting and offering a counter, you're continuing to push for a better deal.

By rejecting again, you can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to your target price of $8,750."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum, but I'm still not quite there. How about $8,850? That's a small step up from my previous offer, but it shows I'm serious about making a deal with you."", ""product_price"": 8850}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  We're offering a slight increase from our last counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to our target.
* **Emphasis on Deal:**  We reiterate our desire to make a deal with Alice to build rapport and emphasize that we're not just trying to get the lowest possible price.
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  We're keeping the offer below John's price of $10,000, ensuring we have a backup option if Alice rejects this offer."
