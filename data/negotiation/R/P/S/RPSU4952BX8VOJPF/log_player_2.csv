"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm ready to pay $105 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $108. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is now offering the product for $108, which is less than John's price of $120.
* **There's room for further negotiation, but not much:** Bob has already gotten Alice down from $110 to $108. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and the risk of losing the deal to John increases with each round.
* **It's a good deal for Bob:**  Bob's target price was $120, and he's getting the product for $108. This is a good deal, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible price."
