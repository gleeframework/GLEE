"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and signals the product's worth. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to anchor the price in Bob's mind around a higher figure.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial price allows me to make concessions in later rounds while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 

This strategy is aggressive but aims to maximize my potential gain while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product holds value for me, but not at that price. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his counter is significantly lower than my initial ask, it demonstrates interest. I'll counter in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, my initial valuation reflects the unique advantages and potential this product offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, it remains well above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, aiming to justify a price significantly higher than Bob's proposal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's seriousness and flexibility.  A significant counter from him could indicate a path to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but we're still quite far apart. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to make financial sense for me. Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still substantially below my $1,500,000 minimum. It's too early to settle for a price this low, especially since I have the guaranteed offer from John. I'll continue negotiating, but I'll make a smaller concession this time to signal I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident the value you'll gain from it justifies the cost."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I've reduced my price by $200,000, a smaller drop than before. This signals that I'm approaching my lower limit while still encouraging Bob to move closer to my range.
* **Emphasis on Value vs. Price:**  The message focuses on the value Bob will receive, subtly shifting attention away from the high price tag.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** The tone remains confident, emphasizing the product's worth and subtly suggesting this is a generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to meet me a bit more in the middle.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. Accepting $1,100,000 would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to John's offer. We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob is showing a willingness to move. Now is the time to hold firm and see if he is truly willing to reach my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to make my final offer: $1,550,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value this product brings.  I need a decision on this, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my best price and I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **Slightly Above Minimum:** The price is just above my absolute minimum, leaving a small margin for potential further negotiation while ensuring I get more than John's offer.
* **Introducing Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to make a decision. 

This approach balances firmness with a small degree of flexibility, aiming to secure the best possible deal."
