"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,400,000. That means there's room for negotiation. It's better to try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the price down a bit.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to my ideal price. It's a good deal, considering John is selling it for $1,500,000."
