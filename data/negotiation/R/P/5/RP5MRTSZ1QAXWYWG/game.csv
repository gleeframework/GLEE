"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is significantly higher than I had budgeted.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I'm trying to do the same.  I could come down to $10,500, but that's my absolute limit.",10500.0,Alice,5,
