"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with the $75 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $82.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $78? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $78. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet in the middle between $82.50 and $78? That would put the price at $80.50. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.",80.5,Alice,5,
