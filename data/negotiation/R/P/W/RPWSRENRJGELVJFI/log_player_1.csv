Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it too close to $15,000 might discourage Bob, while going too low leaves potential profit on the table. This price aims to secure the deal with Bob while maximizing my earnings."
