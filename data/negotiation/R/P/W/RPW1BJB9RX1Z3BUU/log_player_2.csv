"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $9,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than his target of $8,000.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, potentially with a counter-offer closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still trying to save some money, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,250 is getting closer to his desired price, it's still higher than his target of $8,000.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, potentially with a counter-offer closer to his target price. There are still several rounds left, and he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,250 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's make a deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point of no return, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, but I need to know that you're willing to meet me halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $9,500, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is pushing Bob closer to her initial offer, which he rejected in the first round. This indicates Alice is unwilling to come down much further.  At this point, with only 3 rounds left,  Bob is risking getting no deal at all if he continues to reject offers.  Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees him the product, even though it's more expensive, and saves him the time and risk of continued negotiations."
