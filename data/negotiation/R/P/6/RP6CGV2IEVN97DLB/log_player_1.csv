Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the potential value to Bob rather than just stating a price. This can make him more receptive to a higher number.
* **Sense of Exclusivity:**  By mentioning that you're offering it to him *before* others, you create a slight sense of urgency and importance.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this price. You'll need to be prepared to potentially negotiate or move on to John if he rejects the offer."
