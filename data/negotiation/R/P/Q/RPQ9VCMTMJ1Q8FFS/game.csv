"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to make a more strategic investment. Could we work with a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make a strategic investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
