"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise.  This price still reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,350,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
