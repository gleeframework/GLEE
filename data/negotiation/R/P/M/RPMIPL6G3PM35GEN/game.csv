"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can we consider this price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
