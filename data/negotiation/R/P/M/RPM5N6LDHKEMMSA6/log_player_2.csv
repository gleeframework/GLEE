"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $22,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $22,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product truly is worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll see a return on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He knows he can get the same product from John for $10,000, so it's worth exploring if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still not comfortable with $18,000. I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still quite a ways away from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another buyer who's interested at a higher price point.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to see some serious movement. How about $16,000? That's a compromise I'm willing to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $16,000 is closer to his budget, he still believes he can get a better price. He's also aware that he has the option of buying from John for $10,000.  It's worth seeing if he can push Alice down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,000, which is a significant move on my part.  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 13000}
