"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to save some money. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering $15,000, which is his maximum valuation of the product.  Even with further negotiation, it's unlikely we'll get him significantly higher. John is offering our minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing us the best possible outcome with no further risk of negotiation."
