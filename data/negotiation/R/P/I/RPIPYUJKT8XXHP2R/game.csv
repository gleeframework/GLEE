"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm not willing to pay $18,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $18,000 reflects the true value, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to reach a deal.  I'm confident this price represents a good compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
