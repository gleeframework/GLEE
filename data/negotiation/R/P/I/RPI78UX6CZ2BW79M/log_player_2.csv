Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $75.  This item is worth considerably more to me, and I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. My best offer is $110, and I won't be able to go any lower.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to budge much further, and you have a guaranteed offer for $80.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a declining chance of success and risks missing out on John's offer entirely."
