"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $75.  This item is worth considerably more to me, and I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. My best offer is $110, and I won't be able to go any lower. ",110.0,Alice,5,
