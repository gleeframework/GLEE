{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is only $750 over Bob's maximum. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a price that is still relatively close to his budget and ensures a deal is reached. There's a chance Alice might come down further, but it's not guaranteed. Accepting the offer minimizes the risk and secures the purchase."
