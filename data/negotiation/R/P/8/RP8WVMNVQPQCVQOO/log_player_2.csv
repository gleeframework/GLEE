{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above my maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we are approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. While I could continue to haggle with Alice, the risk of not reaching an agreement and missing out on the product is too high. It's better to secure the product from John at my maximum budget and avoid any further risk."
