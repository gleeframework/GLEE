Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $150, he has some room to bargain but it's still a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether."
