Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is still a good amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate further."

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and it's better than selling to John. I'd rather secure the deal and move on."
