"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000? I think that's a fair price that would benefit both of us.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground.",8000.0,Alice,3,
