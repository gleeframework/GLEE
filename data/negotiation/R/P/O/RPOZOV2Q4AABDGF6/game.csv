"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Considering the true value of this product, I could come down to $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
