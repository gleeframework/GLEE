"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While that price doesn't quite work for me, I am open to finding a solution that benefits us both. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,4,
