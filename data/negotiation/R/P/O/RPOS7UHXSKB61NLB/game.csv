"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
