"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 simply isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $950,000 is still not workable for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's the lowest I can go. ",1025000.0,Alice,5,
