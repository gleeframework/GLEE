This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice so much of my desired profit. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to drop below $1,000,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price but still stick to my minimum.  I'm hoping we can finally reach a compromise."
