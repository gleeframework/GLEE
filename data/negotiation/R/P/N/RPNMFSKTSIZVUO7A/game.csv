"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $90 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $70, but that's my limit. Do you think we can make a deal at that price?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  To be honest, I'm making some compromises already, and $85 is the lowest I can go. I believe the product is truly worth it, even at that price.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $77.50?",77.5,Bob,6,
