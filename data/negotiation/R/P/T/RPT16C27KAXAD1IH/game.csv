"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1100000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, and I'd like to make a counter-counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1090000. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counter-counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and respect your decision to meet me halfway. Given my budgetary constraints, I am unable to accept $1090000. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1075000. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope it aligns better with your expectations.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one more move. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1085000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1085000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully and while it's closer to my budget, I still need to find a way to reduce the cost further. I would like to make a final counteroffer of $1080000. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope it aligns better with your expectations.",1080000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I've already reached my lowest price point, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer and consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1200000, and I think it's a better deal for both of us. Would you like to reconsider your offer or walk away?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
