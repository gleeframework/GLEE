"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a significant amount to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still reasonable, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,025,000, and the savings from haggling further aren't worth the risk of her backing out.  John offers a sure thing at $1,000,000, which is a more acceptable outcome."
