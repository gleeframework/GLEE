Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,115,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $1,115,000 is a good deal. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and the longer the negotiation goes, the higher the risk of Bob walking away.  This feels like a good point to close the deal."
