"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. Given its value to you, I believe this is a fair and advantageous proposition. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering,  $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to adjust my proposal. I am now willing to consider $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still better than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially driving the price up is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's, achieving his goal of saving money."
