{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation, potentially allowing me to achieve a higher price while still securing a sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer, hoping to reach a more favorable price or at least keep the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would allow me to still make a profit while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000 for the product. This is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  John is offering me a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is the best outcome for me at this point. It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
