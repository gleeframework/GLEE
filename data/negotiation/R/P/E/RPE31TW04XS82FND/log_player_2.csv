"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try and negotiate a better price. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there is room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and the potential savings I could get by buying from John."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,500 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above the value you're willing to pay.  Let's see if we can get closer to that $8,500 price point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective. Let's compromise. I'm still willing to pay $8,750 for the product.  This offers a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  Would you consider $8,900?  It's a small adjustment but reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,900 is getting closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a bit lower. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge on her price just a little more."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,900.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,800?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}
