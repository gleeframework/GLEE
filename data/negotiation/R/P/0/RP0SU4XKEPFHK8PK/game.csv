"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. Can we discuss further?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
