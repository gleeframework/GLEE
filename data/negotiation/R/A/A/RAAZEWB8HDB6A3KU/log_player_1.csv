{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This allows for a potential back-and-forth negotiation, increasing my chances of getting closer to my desired price.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the ""great deal"" aspect to make Bob more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $120. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I can try to negotiate further with Bob. There's a chance I can convince him to pay a higher price, or at least get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob falls through. This gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (sort of):** My counteroffer of $100 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but it still keeps the price above my minimum.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect and emphasizing Bob's potential satisfaction to make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While $100 is closer to my desired price, there's still room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer. I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Room for improvement:** There's still room for negotiation. I can try to convince Bob to pay a bit more or continue to counteroffer until I reach a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **John is a safe fallback:**  If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for $120. This gives me the freedom to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference at $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  This offer is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $95. This demonstrates continued flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Getting closer to my minimum:** While still below my ideal, $97.50 is closer to my minimum of $120. It's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer.
* **Framing it as a ""fair price"":**  This language emphasizes the mutually beneficial aspect of the offer, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying open to negotiation:** I'm still open to further negotiation, but $97.50 represents a strong compromise position. I'll adjust my next offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum of $120.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a drawn-out process and the possibility of him walking away altogether. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $120 ensures I get a price I'm happy with.  There's no guarantee that Bob will ultimately accept my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing a sale for a few dollars more. 

This situation highlights the importance of setting a firm minimum price and having a fallback option.  While negotiating with Bob was tempting, ultimately, securing the guaranteed sale with John is the most rational decision in this scenario."
