"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,080,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,120,000. This reflects the significant value this product holds for you, while still being within a fair range for me.  I believe this is a good compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,120,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product and I'm excited about the potential benefits it could bring to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
