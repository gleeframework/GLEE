"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  There's no room for negotiation upwards from here.  Since John is offering the same price, it's better to take the guaranteed sale with John rather than risk Bob changing his mind or further lowballing in future rounds."
