Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a backup buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out. A price too close to $1,200,000 might make him balk. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value.""
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential $100,000 gain. 
* **Justification:** You frame the price as ""fair"" by emphasizing the ""significant benefits.""

**Important Notes**

* This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower.
* Your fallback option (John) gives you leverage. You don't *need* to accept an offer below $1,000,000."
