Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, attempting to sell it to Bob for a higher price first maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($100), leaving room for negotiation while still being below my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **First Refusal Tactic:** By emphasizing that Bob has the first opportunity to purchase, I'm creating a sense of exclusivity and potentially encouraging him to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters, but I won't go below my $150 minimum."
