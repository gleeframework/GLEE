"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. It's still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. It's still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you.

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, as it saves him $2,000 compared to Alice's offer."
