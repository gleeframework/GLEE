"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $8800? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",8800.0,Bob,4,
