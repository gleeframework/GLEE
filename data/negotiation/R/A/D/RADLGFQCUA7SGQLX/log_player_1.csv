{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) increases the potential for higher profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than your minimum allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's exclusive opportunity, creating a sense of desirability.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains open for feedback, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in a potential negotiation.

By starting high but not unreasonable, Alice gives herself the best chance to secure a price that surpasses what John is offering."
