"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations for negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that figure, and $1,100,000 represents a significant discount already.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
