"Alice, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $850,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and we can close this quickly.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $800,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
