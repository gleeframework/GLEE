Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $125?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $175 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and try $162.50. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
