"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175 to be fair.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. ",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $175 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and try $162.50. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",162.5,Bob,4,
