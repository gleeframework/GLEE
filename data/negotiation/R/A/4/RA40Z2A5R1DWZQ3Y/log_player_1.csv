Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, getting a deal from Bob closer to that number maximizes our profit.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is a high price, reflecting the product's true value to Alice. However, it's still a significant discount from John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
