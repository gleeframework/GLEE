"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent markup on my minimum value of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum value, it's not my desired price. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial $150 offer. There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It still gives me a good profit margin, but it shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come up with a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $110. It's below my minimum value of $120, and I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  Although I could sell to John for $120, I'm still hoping to get a better deal with Bob. There are still 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a small step up from Bob's last offer, and it's still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about getting close to my desired price, and that I'm not willing to accept a price significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is too low. It's below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I've already rejected three of his offers, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating. Selling to John for $120 is the best option to ensure I don't lose money."
