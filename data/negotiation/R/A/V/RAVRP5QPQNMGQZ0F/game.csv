"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for my budget. While I am very interested in the product, I can only offer $700000 at this time. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the value I'm placing on the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider your proposal. I'm thinking of a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? This is a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to make some concessions to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that $800000 is a fair price for the product, considering the value I'm placing on it. This is my final offer.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach an agreement. How about we meet at $900000? This is a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
