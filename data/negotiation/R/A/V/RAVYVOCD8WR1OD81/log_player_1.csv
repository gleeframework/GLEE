Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it holds significant value and am willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The $20,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000).  While it's unlikely he'll accept this initial price, it helps gauge his interest level and potential for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything. I can confidently sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
