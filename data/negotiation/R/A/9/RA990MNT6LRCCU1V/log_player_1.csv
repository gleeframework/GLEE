**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving in small increments and seems unwilling to budge much beyond $8,600. While we could continue negotiating, there's a real risk that we might not get a significantly better offer from him. Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiations with Bob."
