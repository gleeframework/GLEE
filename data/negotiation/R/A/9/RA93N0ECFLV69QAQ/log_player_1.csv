Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product for a limited time. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or reject it outright. If he rejects it, you still have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
