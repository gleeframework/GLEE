"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your specific needs and expectations. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $14,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counterproposal. Considering the value and benefits of the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $13,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  It's better to try and see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,250, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your flexibility and understanding. My counteroffer is $13,400 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  $13,400 is very close to Bob's last offer of $13,250, and is within his budget. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If Bob keeps rejecting, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or become less willing to negotiate. 
* **Time Factor:** It's better to secure a deal now before the 10 rounds are up, as purchasing from John for $15,000 is a less desirable outcome."
