,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $75? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $82.50. It's fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",82.5,Bob,4,
