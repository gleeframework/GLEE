"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price?",150.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if you're open to that.",80.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,120.0
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $120, which is my absolute minimum. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",120.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. Would you be willing to consider that?",90.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $120. How about we try $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.",105.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that.",95.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,110.0
"I'm not willing to go down to $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $105. How about we try $100? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it. Plus, it's getting close to my minimum price, so I'm willing to consider it.",100.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $97, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.",97.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,105.0
"I'm not willing to go down to $97, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $97 and $105. How about we try $101? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",101.0,Alice,9,,
