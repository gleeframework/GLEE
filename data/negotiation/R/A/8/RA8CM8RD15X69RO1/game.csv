"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $500,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I need us to find some middle ground. I can go up to $700,000.  That's a significant investment on my part, and I'm hoping you can see that I'm serious about getting this deal done.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working towards a compromise.  However, the value of this product is non-negotiable at that low a price.  Let's try $1,100,000 - I believe that reflects the value while leaving room for a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. To be frank, I'm getting close to walking away. I'm willing to offer $850,000 - this is my final offer. It's a fair price and shows I'm serious about this purchase. ",850000.0,Bob,6,
