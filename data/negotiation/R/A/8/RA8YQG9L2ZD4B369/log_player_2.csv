"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I understand this is a good product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.  He has room to maneuver before having to resort to buying from John at a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
