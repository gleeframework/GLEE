"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This price reflects the value to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
