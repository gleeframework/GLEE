"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However,  I'm looking to pay a bit less than your initial price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a price that I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to split the difference, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
