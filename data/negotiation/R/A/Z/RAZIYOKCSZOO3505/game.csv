"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $10500.  That's a significant price reduction from my original offer. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $9500 is getting closer to what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $10000?  That would give us both a fair deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
