prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be very beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value by mentioning its potential benefit to Bob. This might make him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room:**  While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, it's not outrageously high. This gives him the opportunity to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit steep. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening strategy.  How you proceed will depend on Bob's response. Be prepared to negotiate!"
