Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $150, aiming to sell it to Bob for a higher price first maximizes potential profit.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product at $125 creates a potential win-win. Bob gets a $45 discount from your initial asking price, making it more enticing than his perceived value of $80.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of Bob negotiating the price down slightly,  still allowing you to potentially make more than selling directly to John."
