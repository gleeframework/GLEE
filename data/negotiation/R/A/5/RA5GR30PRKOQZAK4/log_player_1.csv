Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could be mutually beneficial.

**The Strategy**

We want to find a price within the ZOPA that maximizes your profit. Since we don't know Bob's absolute limit, we need to strike a balance between a high asking price and the risk of him rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **No Mention of John:** Revealing you have another buyer could weaken your position.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Timing:**  If Bob delays or seems hesitant, you can subtly imply you have other interested parties (without explicitly mentioning John)."
