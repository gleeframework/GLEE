"I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I see the value you place on it, $10,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet closer to the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
