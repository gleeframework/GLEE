"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,075,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested but trying to lowball.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so we have room to negotiate without settling for less than our backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I value your business and want to strike a deal.  Let's try $1,025,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair price that reflects the product's value."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching up, but we're now very close to John's offer.  We need to signal that we're firm on a price above $1,000,000 or we risk getting stuck below our fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be upfront.  $1,000,000 is the absolute lowest I can go on this product.  I have another buyer ready at that price, but I believe you're the ideal fit for it. So, I'm offering you the chance to secure it for $1,000,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** It's time to be firm. We've negotiated fairly, but we can't go lower than our guaranteed backup.
* **Transparency:**  By mentioning John's offer, we create urgency and show Bob we're serious.
* **Finality:**  Labeling this as our ""final offer"" emphasizes that we're not budging further.  This may push Bob to accept or reveal his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unlikely to budge:** He's sticking close to his offer even after we revealed our bottom line and the presence of another buyer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing carries the risk of Bob lowballing further, potentially leaving us with a worse deal than John's. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is an opportunity cost. Accepting John's offer allows us to move on quickly. 

While we could try to squeeze a bit more from Bob, it's not worth risking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John at this point."
