"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To kick off negotiations, I propose a starting price of $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,075,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I value your business and want to strike a deal.  Let's try $1,025,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair price that reflects the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be upfront.  $1,000,000 is the absolute lowest I can go on this product.  I have another buyer ready at that price, but I believe you're the ideal fit for it. So, I'm offering you the chance to secure it for $1,000,000.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",980000.0,Bob,8,
