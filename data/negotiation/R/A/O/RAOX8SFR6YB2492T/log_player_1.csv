This offer starts at a price point that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value for Bob, which could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for a better deal. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired amount."
