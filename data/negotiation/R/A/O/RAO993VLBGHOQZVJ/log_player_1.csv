"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much, hoping to spark Bob's curiosity. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to play along with my negotiation.  If he's interested, I'll adjust my price based on his response in the next round. If he rejects, I'll consider selling to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to maximize profit. $140 is better than $120 (John's offer), but it's still below my desired starting point.
* **Negotiation:** I believe I have room to negotiate further. Bob is showing interest, and he has already reduced his offer from the previous round.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm sending a clear signal that I'm not willing to settle for his price yet. This keeps the negotiation active and gives me the opportunity to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $140 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $180 to $160, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintain Margin:**  $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us.  I'm confident Bob will see $160 as a more reasonable price, and I'm hoping to close the deal in this round. If he rejects, I'll reassess my strategy based on his response and the remaining rounds."
