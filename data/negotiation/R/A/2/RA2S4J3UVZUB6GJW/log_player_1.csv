Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $100 is above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $100 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), giving him incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate up or down if needed. 

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of a successful negotiation while still leaving room for flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think $100 is a little high,  but I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $80, meaning you'll still make a profit.  While you might prefer to get closer to your initial asking price, accepting this offer is the most logical choice:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** You're guaranteed to make a profit of $10, which is better than selling to John for $80.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  Even if you accept this offer, you can always mention to Bob that you're willing to negotiate further if he's interested in buying more from you in the future. This builds a good relationship and might lead to better deals later.
* **Time Savings:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time, and you might not be able to get a significantly better offer. Accepting Bob's offer saves time and effort."
