"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This still represents a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",10500.0,Alice,5,
