"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is lower than her product valuation, but still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to see how much she's willing to move.
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves space for further negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it opens the door for her to counter.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $1,050,000 positions me well below my maximum budget while still being a substantial sum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum value you've mentioned the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as I won't go any higher, and buying from John yields the same price."
