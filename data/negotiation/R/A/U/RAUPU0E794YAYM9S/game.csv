"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product is worth more than $18000 to you. I'm willing to consider a price of $22000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $22000. I'd be willing to pay $19500 for the product. Can you consider that?",19500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $20000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $20500. What do you think?",20500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $20000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, like a free maintenance package worth $1000. So, the total price would be $21000. What do you think?",21000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not willing to pay $21000. I'd be willing to pay $18500 for the product, and I'll take the maintenance package as a bonus. Can you consider that?",18500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $20000 again, but this time I'll throw in a premium support package worth $2000, which is a $2000 value on top of the maintenance package. So, the total price would be $22000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the premium support package, but I'm still not willing to pay $22000. I'd be willing to pay $17500 for the product, and I'll take both the maintenance and premium support packages as a bonus. This is my final offer. If you can't meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",17500.0,Bob,10,
