"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $200 is already a steal for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is closer to my budget and a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130, which is a fair compromise. If we can agree on this, I'll buy it right away.",130.0,Bob,6,
