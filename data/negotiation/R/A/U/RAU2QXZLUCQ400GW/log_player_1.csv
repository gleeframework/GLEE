Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it's a great deal, what do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):**  Starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very keen, but still ensures you get close to your maximum possible profit.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $119 seems more appealing and ""cheaper"" than a round number like $120, potentially making Bob more likely to accept."
