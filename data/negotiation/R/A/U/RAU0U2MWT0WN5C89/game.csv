,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This offer stands as a sign of my willingness to negotiate fairly.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer - if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with another option.",9500.0,Bob,4,
