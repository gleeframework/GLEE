Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This will give me the best chance to maximize my earnings.  If Bob rejects, I can then start to consider John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm going to counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering a price of $950,000. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this price will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to earn a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price point. While $850,000 is a respectable amount, it's still below my minimum value.  Given that John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
