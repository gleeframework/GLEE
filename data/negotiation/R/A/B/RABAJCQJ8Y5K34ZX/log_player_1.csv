{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've started with a price of $1,100,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for me. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the value of the product for Bob, setting the stage for a win-win negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and makes it clear that a counteroffer is welcomed.

This initial offer sets the stage for a productive negotiation process. If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can meet the price of $1100000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is still within the range of the product's value to him, it's far below the $1,000,000 minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm rejecting his offer because I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll now counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's potential for you. I'm open to further discussion, but I won't go any lower."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price remains above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Finality:**  I've made it clear that $1,050,000 is my final offer, but I'm still open to discussion. This adds a bit of pressure for Bob to consider my proposal seriously.

This counteroffer is a step towards finding a mutually beneficial agreement. It's firm enough to ensure my profit but flexible enough to keep the negotiation going."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1050000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
