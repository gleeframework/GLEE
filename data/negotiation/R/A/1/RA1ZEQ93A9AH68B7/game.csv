"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I can see in the product for my business.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. However, it's still above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and my original offer of $1,200,000. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
