"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is fair. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your desired price:** $1,050,000 is a significant improvement over her initial offer of $1,100,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that continuing to negotiate will lead to Alice becoming more firm on her price, or even rejecting future counteroffers. 
* **Value vs. risk:**  While you might be able to squeeze out another $50,000, the potential for the deal to fall apart is a bigger risk than accepting this offer.  
* **John's offer:** Buying from John is much more expensive, so this offer from Alice is still a good deal compared to that option."
