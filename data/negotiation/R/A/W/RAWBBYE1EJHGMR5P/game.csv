"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1200000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1100000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
