Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my financial situation, I am unable to go above $1,550,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we still have room to negotiate and we're aiming for the highest profit. Accepting $1,550,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $1,600,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to offer $1,575,000 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable and fair for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation and Bob is increasing his offers in smaller increments.  While $1,575,000 is a good offer, it's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get closer to $1,600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  Let's close this out – $1,585,000 and we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1585000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation. Offering a price of $1,585,000 leaves room for a final counter from Bob, potentially reaching  close to our desired $1,600,000.  It also puts pressure on him to close the deal as we're reaching the point where accepting John's offer might be more time-efficient."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I am willing to consider $1,580,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to get the best deal possible and is unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting $1,580,000 at this stage represents a strong profit margin and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in the final rounds.  While we could potentially squeeze out a few thousand more, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
