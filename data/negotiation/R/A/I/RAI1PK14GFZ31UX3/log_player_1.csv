Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate (if he's inclined) while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, allowing you to aim higher with Bob."
