Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we want to start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification for the price:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, making the higher price seem more palatable. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it doesn't completely shut down the possibility of Bob negotiating a lower price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential gain and increasing the chance of a successful sale with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed offer from John."
