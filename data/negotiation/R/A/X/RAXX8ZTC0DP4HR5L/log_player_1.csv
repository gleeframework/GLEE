I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to me and Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations have reached a point where Bob's offers are getting close to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm concerned we may not be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Additionally, John is willing to buy the product at my minimum acceptable value. To avoid further delays and ensure I get my desired price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John."
