"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our discussion, $1,400,000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a fair return while offering you a significant opportunity.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
