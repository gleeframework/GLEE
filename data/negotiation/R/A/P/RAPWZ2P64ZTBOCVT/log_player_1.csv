"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This allows room for negotiation without immediately alienating him.
* **Message:**  The message is positive and focuses on the value proposition of the product, aiming to spark Bob's interest.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price within the 10 rounds.
* **John as a Backup:**  The knowledge that I have a backup offer from John at $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** While I am open to negotiation, I need to ensure I get at least my minimum value.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and continue the negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold firm on my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our discussion, $1,400,000 is below my minimum threshold for this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a fair return while offering you a significant opportunity.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price point that's above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing a desire for mutual benefit and a successful outcome.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value proposition of the product, reminding Bob of its potential benefit.
* **John as Leverage:** The knowledge that I have an alternative buyer at $1,500,000 allows me to be firm on my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is the midpoint between our current offers. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This aligns with my goal of earning at least that much for the product.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that any further concessions would bring the price closer to Bob's initial valuation, reducing my profit.
* **John as a Backup:**  Although John would offer the same price, accepting Bob's offer secures the sale and avoids the potential risk of Bob backing out. 

In this round, it's strategically advantageous to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
