"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong anchor price above my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message frames the price as justified by the product's ""true value,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth even more than Bob anticipates. 
* **Alternative:** I'm aware of John's offer, which acts as a strong fallback option. This allows me to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll aim to secure a price closer to my initial offer before considering accepting his valuation or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's unique features and market potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $100,000 from my initial offer to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still aiming high, well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value beyond Bob's current assessment, aiming to shift his perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,350,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is clearly interested and has moved considerably from his initial offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,350,000 represents a substantial profit above my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob walking away or my other offer expiring. Securing a good deal now outweighs a potentially small gain with more rounds."
