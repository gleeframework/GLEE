"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10200.0,Alice,5,
