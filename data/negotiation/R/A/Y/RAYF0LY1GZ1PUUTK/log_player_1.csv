Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this price reflects that while still providing me a good return on my investment."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 allows for some potential back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Above Minimum:** The offer is significantly higher than John's $8,000 offer, ensuring a good profit even if Bob rejects it.

**Important:** This strategy assumes no further information about Bob's negotiation style or other factors that might influence his decision."
