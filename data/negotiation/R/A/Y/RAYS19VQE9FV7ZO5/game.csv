"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? This would still be a great deal for you and would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,800 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without having to go through the hassle of finding another buyer. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
