"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at $95. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation close to her own valuation. There's room to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $95 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Polite and Engaged:**  We maintain a positive tone to foster a good negotiating relationship.
* **Express Interest, but with Reservation:** We signal interest in the product but make it clear the initial price isn't ideal.
* **Significant Counter:**  A $70 counter-offer aims to shift the negotiation closer to our target range.  This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $80 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still above our target price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, and there's a good chance Alice will come down further, especially since she's expressed a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $80 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to go down to $75?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We acknowledge Alice's movement on the price to encourage further compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:** We hold firm to our goal of a lower price while maintaining a respectful and reasonable tone.
* **Incremental Movement:** A counter-offer of $75 shows willingness to compromise but also keeps us in a good position for potentially one more round of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to offer the product at $77. This price reflects a fair compromise between our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  A price of $77 is a solid deal, saving us $23 from John's price and representing a significant discount from Alice's starting point.
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the potential savings are unlikely to be substantial, and we risk Alice walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  We've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now secures the product at a good price without further delay."
