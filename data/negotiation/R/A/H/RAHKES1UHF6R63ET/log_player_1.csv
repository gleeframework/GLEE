"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This tactic allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valuable.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value and using positive language, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially make him more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrasing ""to kick things off"" and the question at the end signal that I'm open to negotiation and value Bob's input. 

This strategy is aggressive but aims to maximize my potential profit. I'm willing to negotiate, but I also have the security of John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is quite high, though. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be a more realistic starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counteroffer was expected, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your business. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Countering:** I begin by acknowledging Bob's offer and counterpoint while still emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:**  I've lowered my price by $400,000, demonstrating flexibility but remaining well above both Bob's offer and my $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""potential return on investment,"" I'm reminding Bob of the product's benefits, steering the conversation away from purely price-based arguments.

This approach aims to find a balance between standing firm on my valuation and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I can do $1,100,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still under.  I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe I can get him closer to $1,500,000, especially with fewer rounds remaining. I'll use the declining rounds as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer demonstrates a real commitment to acquiring the product.  However, we need to find a price that reflects its true value for both of us. Considering we are over halfway through our negotiation time, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  By explicitly mentioning the limited rounds remaining, I'm introducing a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Declaring this as my final offer adds weight to the proposal. While I might be willing to negotiate slightly, it signals strong resolve.
* **Small Concession, Above Minimum:** Lowering to $1,600,000 is a modest concession, but it keeps me safely above my absolute bottom line.
* **Positive Language:**  Continuing to use positive phrasing about Bob's ""commitment"" keeps the tone collaborative despite the firm stance.

This strategy aims to secure a favorable deal quickly, leveraging the time constraint and a firm but fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I have to be realistic about my budget. $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $1,250,000.  This is a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering we both want to see this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my $1,500,000 minimum, I'm doubtful he'll reach it in the remaining rounds.  His increases are getting smaller, and I set a firm tone with my ""final offer."" 

It's time to cut my losses. John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  Waiting longer with Bob risks a lower final offer or even him walking away, leaving me with nothing."
