"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is quite high, though. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be a more realistic starting point. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your business. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I can do $1,100,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging my financial limits.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer demonstrates a real commitment to acquiring the product.  However, we need to find a price that reflects its true value for both of us. Considering we are over halfway through our negotiation time, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I have to be realistic about my budget. $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $1,250,000.  This is a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering we both want to see this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
