"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $95?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95. I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",105.0,Alice,5,,
