"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant value proposition for you, as you've stated the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. This price allows for a comfortable profit margin for both of us. If you decide not to proceed, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Please let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
