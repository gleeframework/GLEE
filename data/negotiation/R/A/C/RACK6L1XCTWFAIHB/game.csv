"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $160?",160.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $140?  I'm really interested in getting this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,,

"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $145, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $140, which is a fair compromise. Let's seal the deal!",140.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,150.0
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I need to make a profit, so I'll stick with my previous counteroffer of $150. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",150.0,Alice,7,,
