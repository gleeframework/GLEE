"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is still a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still provides a substantial profit margin for you and represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, while also giving you a decent profit margin.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
