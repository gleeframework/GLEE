{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a substantial margin for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is still a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation to reach a higher price. Bob acknowledges the product's value, so there's potential to bridge the gap between your desired price and his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still provides a substantial profit margin for you and represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, while also giving you a decent profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $1,050,000.  It's a significant profit compared to selling to John, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid financial outcome and finalizes the sale."
