Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing your profit slightly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit from Bob with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
