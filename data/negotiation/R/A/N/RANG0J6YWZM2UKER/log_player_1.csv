Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However, the value of this product to the right buyer is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is my final offer.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, his ""final offer"" language suggests we won't be able to negotiate him much higher. Selling to John guarantees we get our minimum acceptable price."
