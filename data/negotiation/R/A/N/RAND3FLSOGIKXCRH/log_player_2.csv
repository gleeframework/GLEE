Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.

This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Would you be willing to consider this price?

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, it's clear she's unlikely to reach my ideal price point. At this stage, the potential savings with Alice are outweighed by the risk of the negotiation dragging on.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets my needs."
