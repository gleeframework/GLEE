"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8000.  Would you be open to $8250?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to $8000, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8400. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8400.0,Alice,5,
