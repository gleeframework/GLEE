Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Balancing Value and Urgency:** The message highlights the product's value to encourage Bob while not pushing him away with a price too close to $12,000.

This approach aims to get the best possible deal without risking losing the sale to John."
