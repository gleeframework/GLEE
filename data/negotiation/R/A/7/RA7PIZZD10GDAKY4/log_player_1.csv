Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond what I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work, I may need to explore other options.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still far too high for me.  I've been very clear about my budget, and $800,000 is the absolute most I can spend. I think it's a fair offer considering I'm willing to meet your needs without further negotiation.  If you're not willing to come down any further, I'll unfortunately need to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly rooted at $800,000 and even using John as leverage, it's unlikely he'll move significantly.  Accepting his offer means a loss of $700,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to walk away and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
