"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
 ""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin negotiations significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** By framing the price with ""unique value and potential,"" you subtly anchor the discussion around a higher figure.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point for our discussion"" explicitly signals your willingness to negotiate. 

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial high price, you win big.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response (accept, counteroffer, or walk away) will provide valuable information about his perceived value and negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while leaving some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it shows he's somewhat serious, you have plenty of room to negotiate and John's offer provides a strong fallback option. 

You should aim to bring Bob closer to your desired range in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value. However, there's a substantial gap between our positions. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This reflects the product's true worth and the significant potential it holds for you."",
 ""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While still above both your minimum and Bob's offer, the decrease from $2,250,000 to $1,950,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reaffirming Value:**  By reiterating the ""product's true worth"" and ""significant potential,"" you subtly anchor the discussion around a higher value proposition.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** This counteroffer aims to see how serious Bob is about purchasing and if he's willing to meet you closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,950,000 is still more than I can afford.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
