"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while leaving some room for negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value. However, there's a substantial gap between our positions. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This reflects the product's true worth and the significant potential it holds for you.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,950,000 is still more than I can afford.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
