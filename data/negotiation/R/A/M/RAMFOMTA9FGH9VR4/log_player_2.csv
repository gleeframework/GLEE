"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product I believe you would find valuable.  I'm confident it's worth at least $12000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a significant discount from its true value. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further.  Otherwise, I have another interested party ready to purchase it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
