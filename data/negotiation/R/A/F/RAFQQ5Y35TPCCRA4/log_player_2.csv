Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to compromise. Considering your offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500. It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
