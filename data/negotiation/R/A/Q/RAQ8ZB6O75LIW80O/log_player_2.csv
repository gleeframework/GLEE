"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a fair deal.

While closer to your goal, $110 is still above your ideal price. There's room for further negotiation to see if Alice will come down a bit more."
