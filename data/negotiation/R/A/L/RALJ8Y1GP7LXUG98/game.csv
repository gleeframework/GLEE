"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal that works for us both. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit out of reach. Could we possibly settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still significantly less than what I can accept.  To be fair to us both, would you be willing to consider $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience during this negotiation. I understand the value of this product, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. Would you consider $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
