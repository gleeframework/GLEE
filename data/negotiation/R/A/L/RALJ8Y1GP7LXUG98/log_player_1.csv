Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal that works for us both. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still significantly less than what I can accept.  To be fair to us both, would you be willing to consider $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your patience during this negotiation. I understand the value of this product, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. Would you consider $12,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet my minimum price. It's unlikely he'll go higher than $12,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
