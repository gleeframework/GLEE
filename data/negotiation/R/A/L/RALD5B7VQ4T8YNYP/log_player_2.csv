Alice's initial offer is above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
