{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while he's willing to pay a fair price, I'm concerned that we're not getting any closer to a deal that meets my needs. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm worried we'll run out of time. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
