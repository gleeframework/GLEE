Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. 
* **Gauging Bob's interest:** This offer serves as a way to see how eager Bob is. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can work towards a mutually agreeable price that's still above your minimum."
