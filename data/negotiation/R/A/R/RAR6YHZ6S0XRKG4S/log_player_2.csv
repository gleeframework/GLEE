"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to lower the price.
* **John's offer is a fallback option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum value.  It shows you're serious about getting a deal but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** The message highlights your understanding of the product's value and your budgetary constraints.
* **Open to compromise:** The ""middle ground"" language encourages further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above your target.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can try to bring the price down further, ideally to a point where it's more in line with your budget.
* **John's offer remains a viable option.** If negotiations with Alice continue to stall, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our interests.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within budget:** This counteroffer is still within your budget and allows for potential future concessions.
* **Building momentum:** A small increment shows that you're serious about finding a middle ground and ready to close the deal.
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing ""fairness"" and ""finalizing the deal"" keeps the conversation moving towards an agreement."
