Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob at a lower price might still result in a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $140 creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. It's significantly higher than his perceived value ($80) but still allows me to make a substantial profit if he accepts.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this initial offer is firm, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome, prioritizing a potentially quick and profitable sale to Bob while retaining the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
