"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider it closer to $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $150 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is getting closer but it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $90 from Bob is better than selling to John for $100.  It's a small loss compared to my initial goal, but avoids the risk of further negotiation."
