Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. What would you say to a price of $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer that still leaves room for compromise. 
* **Value-Based Pricing:** Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, offering it at $130 gives him a $20 discount, making it an attractive proposition.
* **Backup Option:** Knowing you can sell to John for $80 provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob."
