"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we agree on $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a more significant reduction. How about we try $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect your approach. However, this product offers significant value, and I need to ensure it's reflected in the final price.  $981,250 is my final offer.  It represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits us both.",981250.0,Alice,7,
