"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more so than for me.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done, Bob can likely do better.  He's got 10 rounds to negotiate and has a fallback option with John.  It's worth exploring if he can get the price down closer to Alice's minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, I'm still confident that this product's true value to you is much higher.  Would you consider $900,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price that's higher than Bob's target.  While she's moved a bit closer, he can likely squeeze out more savings.  He has several rounds left and a backup option with John.  Bob should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $900,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I believe we can find a price that reflects the true value of this product for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's target of $800,000.  He's already had a few rounds of negotiation and has a backup option with John, but it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer will save Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John."
