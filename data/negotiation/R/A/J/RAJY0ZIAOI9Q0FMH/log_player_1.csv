"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a bold opening, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his budget might be. If he rejects, I can adjust my price down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to get concerned about the negotiation, I'm still holding out for a better price.  $650,000 is too low for me. I'll counter again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and that we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John.  Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum threshold, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, John's offer guarantees me a sale at my minimum."
