Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's high value without explicitly stating your minimum price. This allows for flexibility.
* **Alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, giving you leverage.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can counter-offer or proceed with John.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, be prepared to negotiate if Bob pushes back on the initial price."
