Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
