Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $110. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my walk-away price ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, I'm hoping to nudge Bob towards accepting the initial offer, even though it's above his perceived value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. I'd like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's counteroffer of $95 is closer to his perceived value but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 

I'll craft a counteroffer that balances firmness with a willingness to compromise slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $95 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $105? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down slightly from my previous offer ($110 to $105), signaling flexibility. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:** However, I'm still holding firm above Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **Encouraging Compromise:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hoping to nudge Bob towards a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to stick to a price point of $95 for the product. Thank you for considering my request. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firmly anchored at $95, indicating he's unlikely to move significantly from this price point.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price or a failed negotiation, which could cost me time and potential profit. 

While I could try to negotiate with Bob further, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk and the guaranteed sale with John."
