"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $16,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer immediately establishes your maximum price point and signals your seriousness about buying the product. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your budget, $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept for this product. Let's find a middle ground - how about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'll continue negotiating to try and get closer to my target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $10,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise. I'm also phrasing it as a suggestion to ""meet in the middle,"" hoping to encourage Alice to be more flexible in her counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, and for recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than my preferred price point of $8,000.  However, it's getting closer and shows that Alice is open to further negotiation. I'll continue bargaining to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product.  However, I'm still keeping it below her last offer. This counteroffer demonstrates a genuine effort to meet halfway while also pushing towards my desired price range."
