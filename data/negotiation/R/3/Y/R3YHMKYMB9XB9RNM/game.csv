"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $16,000.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your budget, $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept for this product. Let's find a middle ground - how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, and for recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
