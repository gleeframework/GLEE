Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I'll make an offer that is slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $1,300,000}

This is my opening offer, and I'm waiting to see if Bob will accept it or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Since this is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I think it's a good idea to accept his offer. After all, I can still earn a decent profit of $0.

So, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
