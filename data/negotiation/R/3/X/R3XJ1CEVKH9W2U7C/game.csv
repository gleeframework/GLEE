"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $112. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",112.0,Alice,5,
