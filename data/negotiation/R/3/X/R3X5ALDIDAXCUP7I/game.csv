"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,150,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still leaves a bit of room for negotiation.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
