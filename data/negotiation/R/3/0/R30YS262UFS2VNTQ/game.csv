"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit far from your target, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on the deal. I can offer it to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
