"Alice,  $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit out of my range.  My absolute limit is $8000.  If you're willing to consider that, we can make a deal. ",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
