"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, and I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach an agreement, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $765000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's price. While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and ultimately having to pay John's higher price is too great.  It's time to secure this product at a favorable price."
