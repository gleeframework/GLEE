"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $10000 at this time.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $18000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a more comfortable price range for you, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $16500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's rarity and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16500 is getting closer, but I'm still limited by my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15000.  Let's see if we can find a way to bridge this gap.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice,  I appreciate your final offer, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15500.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach an agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering $16000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",16250.0,Alice,9,
