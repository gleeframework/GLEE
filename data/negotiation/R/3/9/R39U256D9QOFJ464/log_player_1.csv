Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. I'm aiming to maximize my profits, but I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay that much.  I'm hoping to get a counteroffer from Bob that's closer to my target price. If he rejects the offer, I can always adjust my price or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $15,000. It's also very likely that Bob won't go higher.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
