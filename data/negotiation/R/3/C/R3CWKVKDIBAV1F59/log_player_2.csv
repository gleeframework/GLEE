Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your revised offer and your understanding of the product's potential. It seems we both recognize its value, but there's still a gap in our valuations.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a deal. However, I'll be straightforward - $1,100,000 is simply too far from where I can make this work. My absolute minimum for this product is $1,450,000. I'm making this final offer because I believe in its value for your business, but I also have other opportunities I need to consider if we can't agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has set her absolute minimum at $1,450,000. This is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and even your latest offer of $1,100,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.  It's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
