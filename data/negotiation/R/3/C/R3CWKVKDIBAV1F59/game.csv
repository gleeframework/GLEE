"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial price is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the value it can bring to your specific needs.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. To move this forward, I'm proposing $950,000. This offer reflects a significant investment from my side and acknowledges the product's potential value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your revised offer and your understanding of the product's potential. It seems we both recognize its value, but there's still a gap in our valuations. To bridge this, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's unique attributes and the significant returns it can generate for you.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but we need to find a more sustainable middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the budget constraints I'm working within.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a deal. However, I'll be straightforward - $1,100,000 is simply too far from where I can make this work. My absolute minimum for this product is $1,450,000. I'm making this final offer because I believe in its value for your business, but I also have other opportunities I need to consider if we can't agree.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
