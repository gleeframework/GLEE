"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $14,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is capped at $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $14,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $13,000. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product, which is closer to my initial target of $10,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",11500.0,Bob,4,
