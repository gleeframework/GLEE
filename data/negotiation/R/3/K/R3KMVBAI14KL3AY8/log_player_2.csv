"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. He has room to negotiate and can likely secure a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $1,200,000. A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $1,300,000, showing Bob's serious intention to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,280,000, which is getting closer to Bob's ideal price. However, Bob still has some room to negotiate and can likely secure a better deal by making another counteroffer. He is close to his ideal price, but still wants to try to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1260000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his strategy of gradually lowering the price.  $1,260,000 is a compromise between Alice's latest offer of $1,280,000 and Bob's desired price of $1,200,000. It demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, while still maintaining some leverage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has gone back up to her initial offer of $1,300,000.  Bob has already rejected this price and has been trying to get it lower, but Alice seems to be unwilling to budge. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming clear that Alice is not going to come down to a price that Bob is comfortable with. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is the best option at this point, as it guarantees a price that fits within Bob's budget and avoids further potential delays and frustrations with Alice."
