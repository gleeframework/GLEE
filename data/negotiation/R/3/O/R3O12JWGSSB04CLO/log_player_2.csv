"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I'm sure you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above my maximum budget of $800,000.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where I'm willing to buy. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $750,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still slightly above my maximum of $800,000. I'm going to try to push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $800,000?  This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $800,000. I've stated this is my final offer to signal that I'm serious about this price and encourage Alice to accept it.  If she rejects, I can always buy from John."
