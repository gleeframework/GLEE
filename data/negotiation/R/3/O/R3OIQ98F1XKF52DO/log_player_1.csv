Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,200,000. I believe its value will be substantial for you, but I understand if that's outside your budget."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor. This makes any subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Politeness and Understanding:** Framing the offer politely and acknowledging the possibility of rejection helps maintain a positive relationship, even if Bob declines the initial offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price leaves ample room for negotiation. Alice can gradually lower the price, potentially still securing a significantly higher profit than her guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his responses and willingness to pay."
