Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Our goal is to get as close to that as possible while staying above our minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to make a decision faster and potentially avoid losing out on what he perceives as a valuable product.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat rational and values the product.  If you know Bob to be a particularly tough negotiator or someone who might try to low-ball you, you might adjust your starting price slightly higher. 
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  A higher starting price carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. You're comfortable with this risk because you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,000,000."
