# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer is just barely above your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down further before settling for John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from my budget. It's worth countering again before accepting her offer or going with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  While it's above your ideal price, it's still a $50,000 saving compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
