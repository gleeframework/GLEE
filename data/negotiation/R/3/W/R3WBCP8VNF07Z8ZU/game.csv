"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,001.",1200001.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit away from what I can comfortably afford. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
