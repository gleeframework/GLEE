"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your cost.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John, there's still room to negotiate with Bob.
