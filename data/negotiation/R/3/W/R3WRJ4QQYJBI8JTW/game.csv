"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair deal.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your cost.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my budget of $8,000.  If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to look at other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
