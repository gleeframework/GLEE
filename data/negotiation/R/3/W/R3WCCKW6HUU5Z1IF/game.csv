"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. I know you'll recognize its immense value. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way above my budget. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential, and it allows for a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the unique nature of this product. Let's meet closer to the middle - I'm willing to part with it for $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000. It's a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both prioritize a win-win outcome.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I value that.  Let's bridge the gap.  How about $1,450,000?  This reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's compromise once more â€“ I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and would allow for a comfortable profit on your end. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement in this round.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
