Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. I know you'll recognize its immense value. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way above my budget. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential, and it allows for a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the unique nature of this product. Let's meet closer to the middle - I'm willing to part with it for $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further.  He has 7 rounds remaining and can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000. It's a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both prioritize a win-win outcome."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I value that.  Let's bridge the gap.  How about $1,450,000?  This reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject Alice's offer. He's getting closer to his target price, but he has 5 rounds left and can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  The risk of buying from John is always there, but Bob should try to push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's compromise once more â€“ I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and would allow for a comfortable profit on your end. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
