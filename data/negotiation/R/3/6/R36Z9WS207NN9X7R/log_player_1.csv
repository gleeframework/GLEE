"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I want to maximize my profit.
* **Setting the tone:**  The message is friendly and positive, but it also emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $1,500,000 is a significant amount, making it likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation process.

**Important note:** This is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds. If Bob doesn't respond or makes a counteroffer that's too low, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $1,100,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can initiate a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can secure a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in round 3, aiming to get a price closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000. I'll need to be strategic and consider Bob's budget and potential willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still gives you a good value for the product, and it's a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate that the price still offers Bob a good value for the product, emphasizing the benefits he will receive.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome. This counteroffer is a strategic move to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and potentially secure a deal closer to my initial asking price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer carefully and adjust my strategy accordingly, potentially moving closer to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1300000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer.  While it's still below my initial goal, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer carries the risk that he'll walk away entirely, forcing me to accept John's offer for $1,000,000. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting Bob's offer secures a profit that's significant enough to justify moving forward.

**Conclusion:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profit of $200,000.  While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable outcome considering the limited time and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
