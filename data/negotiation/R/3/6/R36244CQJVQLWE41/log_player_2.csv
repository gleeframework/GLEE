"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $1000000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a truly exceptional asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the $1,500,000 you'd pay to John.  While you don't know the exact value of the product to Alice, this is a clear opportunity to save $500,000."
