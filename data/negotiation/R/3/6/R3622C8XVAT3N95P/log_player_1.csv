"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might consider. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $92.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to John for $100. I've had four rounds of negotiation and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum. It's likely that we'll continue to go back and forth and I'm not confident that I can get a higher price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, and saves time and energy."
