"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us and a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer to pay even less, it's still significantly lower than the $10,000 price from John. Accepting this offer saves me $1,000 and ensures I get the product I want."
