"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about we settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
