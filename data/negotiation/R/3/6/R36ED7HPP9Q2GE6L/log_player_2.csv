"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can likely get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially save even more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

You're still closer to your desired price of $85. Rejecting allows for another round of negotiation. You can aim for a compromise closer to $87 or $88."
