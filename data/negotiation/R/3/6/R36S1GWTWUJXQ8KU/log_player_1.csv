"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value without being aggressive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the price is high, explicitly stating openness to Bob's thoughts encourages him to engage in the negotiation. 
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how interested he truly is and how much he might be willing to pay.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down significantly, starting high increases the chance of landing a price closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a substantial amount and significantly closer to your minimum, you have plenty of negotiating room left and rounds to spare. Bob's willingness to offer this much indicates a strong interest in the product.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob, and understand your perspective on the price.  Considering the product's unique value, I'm targeting a price closer to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $200,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate but avoids drastic changes that could undervalue the product. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the ""unique value"" reinforces the reason for the high price without being overly aggressive.
* **Open Dialogue:** Phrasing like ""fair compromise"" and ""what do you think?"" encourages continued negotiation and a collaborative approach. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain Momentum:** Keeps the negotiation moving while subtly steering toward your desired price range.
* **Test Bob's Limit:** His response will reveal how much further he's willing to go, providing valuable information for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I still think the product is worth less than $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.  While $1,950,000 is tempting, we're still in Round 4 with plenty of negotiation room. It's worth testing his upper limit, especially since you have the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $2,050,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your investment."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** A $100,000 decrease shows movement toward Bob but maintains a strong position above $2 million. 
* **Shifting Focus:** The message subtly shifts from ""my price"" to ""finding a solution,"" emphasizing collaboration.
* **Anchoring ""Investment"":**  Framing it as an ""investment"" reinforces the product's value and potential for Bob.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain Control:**  Dictates the pace of concessions without appearing inflexible. 
* **Test Bob's Resolve:**  Will he continue to meet in the middle, or is he reaching his maximum?
* **Close to Target:**  This price point represents a good profit while still leaving room for minor adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,900,000, which is my final and best offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final and Best Offer"":**  Bob's language indicates he's unlikely to move significantly higher. 
* **Strong Profit:** While not your ideal price, $1,900,000 is a $400,000 profit, significantly exceeding your guaranteed alternative. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation risks losing Bob altogether, forcing you to accept John's offer. It's better to secure a very good deal now than gamble on a slightly better one later."
