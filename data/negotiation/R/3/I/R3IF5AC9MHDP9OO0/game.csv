"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1000000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1200000. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make a small concession to get the deal done, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1200000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
