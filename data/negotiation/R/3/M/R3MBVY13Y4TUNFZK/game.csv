"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Given its unique qualities and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer, but that price is way off for me. This product doesn't quite meet that valuation for me. I could consider a price closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects the real worth while acknowledging your initial interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm looking at other options closer to $700,000. If you can get closer to that range, I'm very interested, otherwise, I may have to explore those other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but I have to be upfront â€“  $700,000 doesn't reflect this product's real market value. I've already made a significant adjustment, and to be completely transparent, my absolute bottom line is $1,800,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, Bob.  I believe in being upfront and transparent in business.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,5,
