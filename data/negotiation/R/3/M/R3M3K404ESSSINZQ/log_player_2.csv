"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's far too high, and he has a better option with John.  He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fantastic deal for a product you'll truly benefit from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $11,000 is still too high for him. He's better off continuing to negotiate with Alice and aiming for a lower price.  If he can't get below $8,000, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer $10,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 10000}
