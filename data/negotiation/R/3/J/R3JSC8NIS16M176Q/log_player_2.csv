# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value this product brings simply exceeds that price point.  To meet somewhere in the middle, how about we consider $1,110,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,110,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,110,000 is still a bit high for me. To make progress, I'm willing to offer $1,080,000. This is a significant step towards finding a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a solution â€“ I can come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is the best offer Bob has received so far. It's still slightly above Bob's ideal price, but it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice walking away, leaving Bob with the more expensive option from John.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision at this point."
