"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is intriguing, but I'm hoping to secure a better price. Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still allowing us both to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
This is a tough first counter from Bob, but we're still early in the negotiation.  We'll reject and try to bring him up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value this product brings simply exceeds that price point.  To meet somewhere in the middle, how about we consider $1,110,000?"",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

We've conceded slightly from our initial offer, but not too much.  This keeps us in a strong negotiating position while signaling a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,110,000 is still a bit high for me. To make progress, I'm willing to offer $1,080,000. This is a significant step towards finding a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We'll reject and propose a counter that keeps us above $1.1 million for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a solution â€“ I can come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

We're getting close to the point where we may have to concede and accept a lower offer. By stating this is our final offer, it might encourage Bob to accept rather than risk the deal falling through."
