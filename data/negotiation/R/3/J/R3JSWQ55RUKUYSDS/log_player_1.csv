"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion, showing I'm willing to compromise. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still being open to negotiation. By starting high, I can hopefully get a good price without needing to drop too low.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation room:**  While I need to earn at least $10,000, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding immediate sale to John:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is an acceptable option, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm lower limit. I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer but maintained a price that's still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** My message emphasizes the fairness of the offer, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:**  I've implied that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also setting a clear expectation that I won't continue to drop my price drastically.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground where both Bob and I can feel we've gotten a fair deal. It's a compromise that allows the negotiation to continue without losing sight of my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my absolute minimum price. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We are already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **No Significant Gain:**  Selling to John would yield the same price as Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

Given the circumstances, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer. This ensures I secure the minimum profit I need and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
