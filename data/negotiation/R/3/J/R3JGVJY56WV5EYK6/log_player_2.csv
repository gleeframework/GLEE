Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,250. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, $10,250 is a good price considering your $12,000 limit and the fact that you're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiation going south and having to pay more from John."
