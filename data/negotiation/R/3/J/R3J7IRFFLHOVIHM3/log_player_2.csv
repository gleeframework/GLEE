Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which is $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000, which is the price I was initially willing to sell it to John for. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.
