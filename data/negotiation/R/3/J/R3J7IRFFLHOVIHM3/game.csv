"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable given the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price given the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate you coming down. However, to make this work for me, I need to be closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which is $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000, which is the price I was initially willing to sell it to John for. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
