Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's becoming clear that Bob is firmly anchored at $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, and there's a risk of losing both Bob and John's offers.  It's time to secure the sale."
