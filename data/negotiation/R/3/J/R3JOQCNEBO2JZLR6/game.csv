"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product looks great, I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to compromise. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500? That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as high as $7,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
