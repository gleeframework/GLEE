"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's more than my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves Bob with some room to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is still above my minimum and leaves me with a good profit. Selling to John would net me less, so accepting Bob's offer is the best decision in this round."
