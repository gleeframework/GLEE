"Hello Alice, thanks for offering! While the product seems nice, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",140.0,Alice,3,
