"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my desired outcome but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open question to encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price point.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to retain control and make a counteroffer that could potentially yield a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall or go below my minimum, I have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the price is still beneficial to him, emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome while keeping negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective. I would like to counter with a price of $12,200 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price of $10,000, but I'm still not satisfied.
* **Small Incremental Increase:**  The difference between his offer and my previous counteroffer is small. I want to see if I can push him a little higher.
* **Risk of Lowering Price:** Accepting his offer might lock me into a price that's lower than what I could potentially get.
* **Potential for Compromise:** I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to find a middle ground that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,200 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the product's true value. How about $12,350?  It's a small increase from your offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm only increasing my counteroffer by a small amount to show I'm willing to meet in the middle but also maintain some leverage.
* **Emphasize Fair Compromise:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  I'm hoping this small increase will encourage Bob to accept or counter with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with a price of $12,300 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Outcome:** Bob's offer is only $50 away from my last counteroffer, and it's very close to my desired outcome of $12,500.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that Bob might reject my next counteroffer or lower his offer further. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 4 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a sale and secures a price that's significantly higher than selling to John. 

It's a calculated risk, but considering the limited rounds and Bob's potential for further negotiation, it's a reasonable decision to accept this offer."
