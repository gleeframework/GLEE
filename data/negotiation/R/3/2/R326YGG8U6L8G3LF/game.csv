"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if that works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you be willing to accept $1,100,000?  This would make the deal more appealing for me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,120,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
