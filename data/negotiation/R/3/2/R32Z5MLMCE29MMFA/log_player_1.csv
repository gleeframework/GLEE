Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a good profit.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Shows you're serious about selling to him:** This price is a clear signal you're interested in a deal.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good profit, it's worth trying to get closer to our original asking price. We'll counter-offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to our desired price point. It's not ideal, but it's a good compromise and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing for more.  It's also possible that continuing to negotiate will result in a lower price, so accepting this offer seems like the most prudent choice."
