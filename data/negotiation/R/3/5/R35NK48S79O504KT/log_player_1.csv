I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price.  While $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price of $95."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $88.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 88}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $80.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his offer, and I've already reached my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John ensures a quick and guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to no deal at all."
