"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $1,025,000. Let's try $975,000 as a counteroffer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $975,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider it under one condition: [Insert a non-monetary term that adds value for you, e.g., a positive testimonial, right of first refusal on your next product, etc.].  Would you be open to that?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I am still committed to staying within my budget. I am prepared to offer $960,000 for the product. This amount includes all terms previously discussed.",960000.0,Bob,6,
