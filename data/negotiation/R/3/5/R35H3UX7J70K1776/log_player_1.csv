Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond Bob's valuation. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and confidence in the product, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and risk tolerance, you could start with a different offer."
