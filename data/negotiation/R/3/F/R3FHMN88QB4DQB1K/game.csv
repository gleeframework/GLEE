"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I think it's a great starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  To move things forward, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it while also acknowledging the potential benefits of this deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your concerns about the price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this purchase.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000, which is just $100,000 above my initial offer. I think this is a fair compromise that balances the value of the product with your budget constraints. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
