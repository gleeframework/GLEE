"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $18,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. This product would be valuable to me at a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $10,000 is substantially lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. It leaves room to gradually increase the offer while staying well below your budget.
* **Polite and Professional:** The message maintains a positive tone and expresses interest in reaching a deal.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that the product's value to you is closer to $10,000, you provide a reason for your counteroffer without revealing your absolute maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $16,000 is still significantly higher than your target price and what John offers. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice showing flexibility suggests there's room to negotiate further toward a price point that works for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little on the price.  While $16,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I feel that's a fair offer reflecting the product's value to me."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  You are gradually increasing your offer, demonstrating willingness to move closer to Alice's price. 
* **Below Budget, Above John:**  The $11,500 offer keeps you under your $12,000 limit while offering Alice more than John's $12,000 price.
* **Continued Justification:**  You reiterate budget constraints and emphasize a perceived fair value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of the value this product can bring to your business and I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:**  Alice has signaled this is her final offer.
* **Above Budget:**  Even with her concession, the price of $14,000 is still above your $12,000 budget.
* **John is Safer:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, ensuring you stay within budget. 

Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a risk. You could offer a price closer to $14,000, but there's no guarantee she'll accept, and you might end up with a worse deal than John offers."
