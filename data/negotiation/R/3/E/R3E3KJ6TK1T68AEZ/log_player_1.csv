"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so I'm taking a calculated risk.  If he rejects this, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired range. I believe I can get closer to my target with further negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the bargaining process and have the opportunity to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to be flexible.  I believe this price is still fair, considering my minimum value for the product and Bob's apparent willingness to pay a substantial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe there's more room for negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price.  However, I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds. I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the more sensible option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000. This is a smaller step down from my previous offer, showing that I'm still aiming for a higher price, but also acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to go much higher.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round, as we are running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,750,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I've already gone down quite a bit from my initial asking price, but we still have a few rounds left. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob just a little higher. If he rejects this, I'll be ready to sell to John, as I'm not sure how much more room for negotiation there is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to offer $1,800,000.  This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my initial target. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to accept his last offer or sell to John.  I'm hoping that the pressure of only having a few rounds left will make Bob reconsider his position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,750,000. We're down to the final two rounds, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's still a significant profit and a good deal considering the time constraints.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is not a better option at this point."
