Hello Alice! Thanks for offering this product.  $120 is a bit too high for my budget though. Would you consider $65?,65.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $90? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $85? It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",85.0,Alice,5,
