{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable price, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for me.  It's also polite and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
