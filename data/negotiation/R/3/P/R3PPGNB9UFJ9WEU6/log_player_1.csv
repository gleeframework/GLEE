I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also shows Bob the value I place on the product. I'm confident in the product's worth, and I want to see if Bob is serious about a high-value purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for that low just yet. I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can get closer to my initial price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,350,000. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob has come up a bit, and while I'd like to get closer to my initial price,  $1,250,000 is a good deal. I'm not sure if I can get much better than this with Bob, and selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a significant loss. It's time to accept Bob's offer."
