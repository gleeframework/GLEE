"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the market, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium price. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000.  This is a significant investment for both of us, so I'm open to discussing the value proposition further if you'd like.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique advantages, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value proposition you've presented.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we're getting closer.  To be frank, my absolute floor on this is $1,000,000.  This is a difficult price to move from, but I'm willing to make that compromise if it seals the deal today.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $920,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,6,
