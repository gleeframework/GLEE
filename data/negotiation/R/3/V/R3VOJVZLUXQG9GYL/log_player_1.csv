While I appreciate your perspective on the market, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium price. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $920,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:** Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $920,000 offer.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Holding out for more from Bob carries a significant risk of losing the sure thing."
