"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it offers to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
