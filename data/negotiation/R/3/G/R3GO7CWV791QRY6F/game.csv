"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1500000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1500000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $1400000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable at this price.  Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1400000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be willing to meet me at $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer. I'm going to make one final offer of $1350000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. If you decline, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
