"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This price is fair given the product's value and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. It's important for me to get a fair price for this product. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000.  This allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $875,000? This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let's finalize this now and avoid going back and forth any longer.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer.  $875,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. How about we split the difference and go with $887,500? It's a fair price that allows us to finalize the deal and move forward.  Let me know what you think.",887500.0,Alice,5,
