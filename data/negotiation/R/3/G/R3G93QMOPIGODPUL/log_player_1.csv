"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is a significant discount for Bob but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Clear Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value Bob gets by stating ""It's a great deal for you"".
* **Setting a Limit:**  I mention ""best price I can offer right now"" to subtly signal there's a limit to how low I'll go. 

**Strategy:**

I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a price closer to my ideal range. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This price is fair given the product's value and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Although John is willing to pay $800,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob recognizes the value of the product, so there's a chance I can get him to increase his offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price slightly higher than his offer.  This shows him I'm serious about getting a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. It's important for me to get a fair price for this product. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000.  This allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm countering with $900,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. 
* **Highlight mutual benefit:** I reiterate the idea of a ""fair price"" and ""walking away feeling good."" This emphasizes a win-win outcome.
* **Show commitment:** By going down to $900,000, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

I want to find a price point where Bob sees value and I can still achieve a profitable sale. By showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, I aim to secure a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $875,000? This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let's finalize this now and avoid going back and forth any longer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of losing time:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still not enough, and I risk losing valuable negotiation rounds.
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, which means there's still potential to push for a higher offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to keep the pressure on Bob to increase his offer, but also need to be mindful of the limited rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer.  $875,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. How about we split the difference and go with $887,500? It's a fair price that allows us to finalize the deal and move forward.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $887,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Show flexibility:** I'm proposing to split the difference, demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly emphasizing finalization to encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution at a price that's almost at my minimum. This keeps the deal moving while minimizing the risk of losing more rounds and having to sell to John at a lower price."
