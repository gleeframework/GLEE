"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I was thinking of starting at $12,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  $10,500 is a substantial drop, indicating Bob's seriousness about a deal.
* **Fairness:** The price is still above Alice's minimum, suggesting a potential compromise.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a good way to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Fair Deal:** $11,500 is a good price for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price and within Bob's budget.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's always a chance Alice might reject another counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher price or a stalemate. Accepting this offer minimizes risk."
