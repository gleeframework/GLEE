"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin while leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested but finds the price too high.  I'll gauge his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer,  giving him a slight discount while still providing me with a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for $110 yet. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a slightly better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm willing to consider selling to John for $120 in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum.  I'm not willing to go lower.  I've reached a point where selling to John is the best option to guarantee my minimum profit."
