"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I make it clear that I'm open to discussing the price. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses in the following rounds.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer before deciding whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.
* I will always keep the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 in mind. This is my safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not good enough.**  While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  I have 8 rounds remaining, so I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  
* **Assessing Bob's interest:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested.  By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his maximum price.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffer and the remaining rounds. 
* I'll aim for a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable price.  
* I'll continue to monitor the potential deal with John as my fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,900,000. This would still leave me some room to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer ($2,000,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,800,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasizing value and fairness:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. The word ""fair"" is again used to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $1,900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate down if necessary. This leaves me with a flexible position and avoids closing the deal prematurely.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If he rejects it, I'll consider making a lower counteroffer in the next round. 
* I'll also keep a close eye on the remaining rounds and my potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting too low:**  $1,700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Time to be firm:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have enough time to push for a better deal. I can't afford to accept such a low price at this stage.
* **Still room for negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to $1,800,000. I'll try to bridge the gap between my minimum and Bob's current offer.
* I'll emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. 
* I'll continue to monitor the potential deal with John as my backup option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows for some flexibility on both sides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($1,900,000) and Bob's last offer ($1,700,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm again using the word ""fair"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer.
* **Highlighting flexibility:**  By mentioning ""flexibility,"" I'm subtly suggesting that I'm open to further negotiation but only within reasonable limits.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* If he rejects it, I'll need to consider if I'm willing to go lower, taking into account the remaining rounds and my potential deal with John.
*  I'll be prepared to either make a final counteroffer or accept Bob's next offer if it's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1650000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,650,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's getting dangerously close to John's offer, but I'm not willing to settle for a loss just yet.
* **Focus on the remaining rounds:**  I have four rounds left, and I'm hoping to push for a better price. Bob has shown some flexibility, so I'm not giving up on getting a better deal.
* **Time to be more firm:**  I'm going to need to be more assertive in my counteroffer to push Bob closer to my desired price point.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous offer, perhaps around $1,800,000.  
* I'll emphasize the value of the product and try to find a middle ground with Bob.
* However, I'll also keep John's offer in mind as my backup option, especially if the next few rounds don't result in a more favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer.  $1,650,000 is simply not enough for me to consider selling.  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but this product is truly worth more.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's your call."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm stance:**  I'm making it clear that $1,650,000 is unacceptable and setting a more firm stance. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reinforcing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Finality:**  I'm signaling that $1,750,000 is my final offer. This adds pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **""It's your call"":**  This phrase puts the ball back in Bob's court, making him feel like he has some control in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.
*  If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to:
    *  Make a slight concession (but no lower than $1,700,000) in the next round, 
    *  Accept John's offer, or
    *  End the negotiation and walk away. 

I'll also be keeping a close eye on the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to take a loss on this product, especially with only two rounds left.
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:**  I'm running out of time and negotiation leverage.  John's offer guarantees me a fair price, even though it's my minimum.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John minimizes the risk of getting stuck with a lower price or potentially ending the negotiation without a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000.
* I will end the negotiations with Bob. 

While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, this is the most logical choice given the remaining rounds and Bob's unwillingness to budge."
