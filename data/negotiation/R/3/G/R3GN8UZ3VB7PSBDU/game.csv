,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1900000. This would still leave me some room to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1700000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1850000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows for some flexibility on both sides. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer.  $1650000 is simply not enough for me to consider selling.  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but this product is truly worth more.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's your call.",1750000.0,Alice,7,
