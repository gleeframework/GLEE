Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'd like to propose a fair deal. Would you consider purchasing it for $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}"

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
