{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,450,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product offers Bob. It also opens the door for further discussion. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy balances the following considerations:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Negotiation:**  It's not too high to immediately scare Bob away.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I can always fall back to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By offering a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value, I can create a sense of urgency and encourage him to negotiate. If he rejects, I can make a counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, and there's still room for me to increase the price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I have other options (e.g., selling to John). This helps me maintain leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. I'll use this counteroffer to gauge his seriousness about buying the product and to see how much higher he's willing to go."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see you're trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,350,000 doesn't reflect the value this product offers you. It's crucial for both of us to benefit from this deal.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000. This is my final offer. It's a fair price considering your interest in the product and its potential to grow your business. If you're serious about acquiring it, let's close this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** The counteroffer of $1,375,000 is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below my desired price of $1,400,000. 
* **Message:**  The message is firm, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob and making it clear this is my final offer. It also adds a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer balances the following:

* **Testing Bob's Commitment:** It pushes Bob closer to my desired price and helps determine his true commitment to the deal.
* **Finality:** It clearly communicates that this is my last offer, leaving less room for further negotiation.

By offering this price and communicating its finality, I aim to see if Bob is willing to compromise and close the deal. If he rejects, I'm prepared to move on to my alternative buyer, John."
