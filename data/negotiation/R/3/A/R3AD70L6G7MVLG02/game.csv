"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still quite low for the value this product provides.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price is fair and gives us both room to benefit from this deal. Let's close this agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal. Let's find common ground and make this happen.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see you're trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,350,000 doesn't reflect the value this product offers you. It's crucial for both of us to benefit from this deal.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000. This is my final offer. It's a fair price considering your interest in the product and its potential to grow your business. If you're serious about acquiring it, let's close this agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
