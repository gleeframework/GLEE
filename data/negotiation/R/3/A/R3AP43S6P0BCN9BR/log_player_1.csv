Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's far below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and come down a bit from my initial price. I hope this is a more appealing price for Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he still refuses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below what I'd ideally like, but it's getting closer to my minimum value and it's higher than what John is offering.  At this point, it's likely we're not going to get a much better price from either of them. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
