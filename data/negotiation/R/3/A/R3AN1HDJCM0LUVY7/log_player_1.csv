"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum value ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately give away too much.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and emphasize the potential for a good deal. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm mentioning that the product is worth more to me, subtly implying the price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product to you, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not desperate and can afford to negotiate further.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the discount from my initial offer to make it seem more attractive.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm reminding Bob that the price is still fair given the value of the product. 
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm explicitly expressing a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my target price of $11,500.
* **Time is Money:** We are already in Round 4, and there is a risk of further negotiations dragging on.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If I keep negotiating and Bob rejects my offer, I might have to settle for a lower price or sell to John, missing out on a potentially faster sale.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is just below my target but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This is a good outcome considering the limited time and potential risks of further negotiation."
