Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is a high starting offer, but it sets the stage for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm willing to start high and see where Bob lands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a price closer to my initial goal."

While $850,000 is closer to John's offer, I'm still willing to hold out for a slightly higher price from Bob. There's still a chance he might increase his offer."

I'm offering $900,000.  This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's, and hopefully, a price we can both agree on."

Bob has reached the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not confident he'll go higher.  It's time to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $800,000."
