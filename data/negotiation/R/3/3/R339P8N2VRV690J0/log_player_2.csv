"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product from John for $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,350,000 is closer to his desired price, he still has room to negotiate further. He can try to get closer to his target price of $1,200,000 before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about we settle on $1,312,500? This is a fair compromise that keeps both of our needs in mind.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,312,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer is high, and he could end up buying from John for $1,200,000.  At this point, $1,312,500 is a reasonable price, given that he can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. It's a good compromise that leaves room for both parties to be satisfied."
