"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'll offer you the product for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",10800.0,Alice,5,
