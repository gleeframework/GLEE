Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This approach allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving you the opportunity to adjust your price if needed.  
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer with a higher offer provides leverage and limits your risk of settling for a price that's too low. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point. The actual offer you make will depend on your assessment of Bob's interest and your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a much higher profit. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's counteroffer shows he is interested, his offer is too low to justify continuing negotiations at this stage. 

**Next Steps:** I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to sell the product to John to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Strategy:**  I'm using a counteroffer to try and find a middle ground with Bob.  $1,100,000 is significantly closer to my minimum but still gives Bob some wiggle room.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** It's important to stay above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 to ensure I don't make a loss.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's initial offer and providing a counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:** I'll wait for Bob's response and decide whether to accept his next offer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Remains Low:** Even with his increased offer, $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Significant Financial Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees a much higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob.

**Conclusion:** While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and maximize my earnings."
