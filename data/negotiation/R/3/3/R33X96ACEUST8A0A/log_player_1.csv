"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I know that's a strong starting point, but I'm confident in its value. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High (but not ridiculously so):** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and still achieve a great price. 
* **Anchor High:**  By setting a high initial anchor, I'm hoping to influence Bob's perception of the product's value and shift the negotiation range in my favor.
* **Gauge Bob's Reaction:** This first offer is as much about gathering information as it is about making a sale. Bob's response will tell me a lot about his negotiating style and how badly he wants the product. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  I have a strong backup option with John's offer of $1,500,000.  I need to keep this in mind as I negotiate with Bob.
* **10 Rounds:** The limited rounds mean I need to make progress in each exchange, but I shouldn't rush to concede too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to his perceived value, I have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. I'm willing to engage in further counteroffers to explore if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and the value it will bring to your business.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I'm not accepting Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility by making a significant price reduction of $300,000. This signals my willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value and relating it directly to Bob's business to justify the high price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps me gauge how much further Bob is willing to go. His response will determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential benefits.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation could drag on. Accepting this offer ensures a very good profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
