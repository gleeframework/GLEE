"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets the negotiation in my favor and leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Fair Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my price, mentioning the value to Bob. This is a tactic to make the offer more appealing and less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation process.

**Note:** I'm not immediately going to John.  I want to see if I can secure a better price with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to the value of the product to both parties. How about $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm not willing to accept his offer yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is a safe fallback, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob before I accept it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to get the product for a price you're comfortable with while still ensuring I get a fair return."", ""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm reiterating that my goal is a ""fair return"" for the product, implying that accepting his offer would be unfair to me.
* **Appeal to Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing that meeting in the middle is a ""good compromise"" to further encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is the same, I've successfully negotiated with Bob and achieved my minimum price.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a deal and allows me to move on without risking further negotiation."
