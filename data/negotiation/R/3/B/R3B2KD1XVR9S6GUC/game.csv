"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $13500?  That would give us both a good deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $13500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $13000? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
