"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price given your interest. Let me know your thoughts!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Given the value of this product to me and the fact that I'm already offering a discount, I can't go any lower than $850,000.  This still represents a significant saving for you compared to what others would charge.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
