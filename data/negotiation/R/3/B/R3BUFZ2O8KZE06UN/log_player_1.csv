{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price given your interest. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer allows for a decent profit for you while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  By stating the value to you, you establish a basis for negotiation.  The message is friendly and encourages a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the discount you've already offered. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price and even lower than his own stated value.  While $750,000 is a better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives you the opportunity to counteroffer with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Given the value of this product to me and the fact that I'm already offering a discount, I can't go any lower than $850,000.  This still represents a significant saving for you compared to what others would charge.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can accept this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price than his previous offers, and it still gives you a decent profit.  While selling to John for $1,000,000 would be the most profitable, the risk of losing the sale to another buyer in the future exists.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
