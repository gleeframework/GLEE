"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $9,000 is lower than the $10,000 John is offering.
* **There's little room for further negotiation:** Bob's previous counteroffer of $8,500 was rejected. Alice has already lowered her price, and it's unlikely she'll go lower again.

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product for a price lower than his maximum and get a better deal than John's."
