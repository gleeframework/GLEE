"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still slightly outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,075,000, which is the same price I offered earlier. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept and still make a reasonable profit.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
