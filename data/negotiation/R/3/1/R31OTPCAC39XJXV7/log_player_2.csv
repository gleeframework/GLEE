While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring the possibility of getting a better price by counter-offering.  You can potentially save $100,000 by negotiating with Alice."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still above my maximum budget. I'm still hopeful of getting a better price by counter-offering again. If I don't, I can always fall back on buying from John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,075,000, which is the same price I offered earlier.

Alice is sticking to her previous offer of $1,075,000.  While this is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget.
