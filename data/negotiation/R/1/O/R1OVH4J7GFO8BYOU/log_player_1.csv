Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love.  I'm offering it to you for $150.  It's worth more than that to me, but I want to see if we can come to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? That's my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $120. I want to see if I can get closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  I can't go all the way down to $100, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a great price for a product of this quality.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. How about $115? I'm confident we can find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price of $120, $115 is still a bit too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to be fair here, but $115 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $117.50?  That's a good price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 117.5}
