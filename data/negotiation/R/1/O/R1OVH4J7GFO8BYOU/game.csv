"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love.  I'm offering it to you for $150.  It's worth more than that to me, but I want to see if we can come to an agreement.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? That's my absolute maximum.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  I can't go all the way down to $100, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a great price for a product of this quality.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. How about $115? I'm confident we can find a middle ground here.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to be fair here, but $115 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $117.50?  That's a good price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!",117.5,Alice,5,
