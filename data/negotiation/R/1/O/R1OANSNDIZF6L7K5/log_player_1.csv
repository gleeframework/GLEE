"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $17,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a little more to get the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price.  While I could accept and be done with the negotiation, I'm going to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $16,500. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good compromise.  While it's not my initial asking price, it's significantly better than selling to John for my minimum price.  I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
