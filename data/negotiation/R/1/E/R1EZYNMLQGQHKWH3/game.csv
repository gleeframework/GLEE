"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be workable?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $810,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the flexibility. It seems like we both want to make this deal happen. How about we split the difference and settle at $780,000? ",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to meet you at $780,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",795000.0,Alice,7,
