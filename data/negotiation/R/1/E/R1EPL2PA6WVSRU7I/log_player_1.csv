"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price, as I know the product is worth at least that to me. If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider the possibility of selling to John, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but not too much.  $110 is a fair compromise given that I know the product is worth $120 to me and I'm confident we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. $105 is a reasonable price, given that the product is worth $100 to Bob. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting very close to my minimum, but I'm starting to feel like Bob is just playing games. He's not willing to budge much, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm going to sell to John for $120 to ensure I get a fair price for my product."
