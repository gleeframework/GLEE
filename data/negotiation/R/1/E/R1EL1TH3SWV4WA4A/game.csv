"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product has value, I'm not quite comfortable with that price point. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I have to make a living from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to give up on a better price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can do $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $7,900 to finalize this deal. It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $7,900 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a minimum of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I can offer you $8,500 again, but this is my final compromise.",8500.0,Alice,7,
