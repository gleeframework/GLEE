"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12000 to us and we believe it would be equally valuable to you. To start, let me propose a price of $10500 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $10,500 is better than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $10,500 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A $1,500 drop from Alice's initial offer shows Bob is serious about saving money but still values the product.
* **Reasoning:**  Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, appealing to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still space for Alice to counter without losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Our counteroffer is $10000 for the product. We hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a fair value for our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, there's still a $1,000 gap.  Bob is aiming for the best possible price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting again shows Bob is not in a rush and is willing to walk away if needed. This keeps the pressure on Alice.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  This round is a test to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm comfortable paying $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Move:** A $500 increase from Bob's previous offer shows he's willing to budge but wants to see Alice compromise as well.
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a middle ground, appealing to Alice's desire for a quick deal.
* **Maintain Pressure:**  While closer to Alice's offer, Bob still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
