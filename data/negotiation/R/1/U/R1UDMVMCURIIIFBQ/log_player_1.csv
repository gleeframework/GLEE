"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds before deciding if I want to lower my price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$60 is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is still higher than my minimum, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer and might be more appealing to Bob.  I'm trying to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push for something closer to my desired price. There are still several rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm counteroffering with $75. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $65. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I don't want to sell the product for less than $75.  I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 72}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $72. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, demonstrating that I am eager to reach an agreement. It's still above my minimum, and I believe it could be a reasonable compromise for Bob. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a price that will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $68
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob is unwilling to budge on his price. While $68 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a satisfactory price for me.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low, so selling to John ensures I get a fair deal."
