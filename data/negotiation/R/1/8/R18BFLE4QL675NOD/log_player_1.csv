Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (the difference between what Bob values it at and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that is:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** This ensures Bob sees the deal as beneficial.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see immense value in. Considering its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer exclusively for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's positive, highlights Bob's perceived value, and introduces a subtle sense of urgency with the ""limited-time offer.""
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit margin ($350,000) while still offering Bob a substantial discount ($150,000) compared to his valuation.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price.  Be prepared to adjust, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum."
