"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at no less than $800000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1000000.  I believe it has tremendous potential for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's potential for further negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price from Alice.  He has room to negotiate down to $1,200,000, which is his maximum price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $925000.  This reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and counter again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $1,200,000. He can try a counteroffer in the range of $875,000 to $900,000."
