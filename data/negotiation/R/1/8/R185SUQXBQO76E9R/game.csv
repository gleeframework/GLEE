"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below the product's value.  To be fair, I could come down to $13,000.  This is my best offer and reflects the true worth of what I'm providing.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
