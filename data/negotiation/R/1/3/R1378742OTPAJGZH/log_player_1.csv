Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. "", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your absolute bottom line, hinting at the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer. This allows you to potentially reach a price even closer to his maximum perceived value."
