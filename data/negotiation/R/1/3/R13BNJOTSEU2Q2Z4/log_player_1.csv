Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $120. I believe it's a great deal, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
 
 
 I am starting with a high initial offer to see how much bargaining power I have.  This leaves me room to negotiate downward while still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
 
 It's important to strike a balance between being assertive and being open to negotiation.  I don't want to scare Bob away with an outrageous price, but I also want to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it and close the deal, there's no room for negotiation left.  I'll try to counter and see if I can get a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100} 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  I'm moving away from my initial high offer, indicating I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Aims for a win-win:**  $100 is a significant profit for me while still being a reasonable price for Bob considering his valuation.
* **Provides a clear target:** Offering a specific price can help move the negotiation forward more quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about $90?  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could try to squeeze a few more dollars out of the deal, Bob's offer of $90 is a solid compromise. It's a $10 profit over my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether.  It's better to secure a good deal now than to hold out for a perfect deal that might not happen."
