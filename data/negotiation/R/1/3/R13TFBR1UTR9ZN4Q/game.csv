"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000?  This would still give you a great deal and allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $950000? That's a bit closer to my target price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $950000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1050000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
