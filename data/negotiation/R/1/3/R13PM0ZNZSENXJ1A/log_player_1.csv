"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer is as much about understanding Bob's seriousness as it is about the actual number. His response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate. 
* **John Option:** While you have John as a backup, it's best to explore the potential of a deal with Bob first.  You might be able to get even more than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is better than John's $1,500,000, but it's still below your target. You have room to negotiate, especially since Bob expressed continued interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You've come down from your initial offer, signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Concessions:**  By meeting in the middle, you're aiming to find a price point that's mutually beneficial.  This also gives you room to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer.
* **Maintain Value:**  You're still holding firm above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring you don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but I also want to let you know that I'm considering purchasing from another seller who is offering a better price. Can you do any better than that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Tactic:** Bob is trying to create urgency with the mention of another seller. This doesn't necessarily mean he has a better alternative, it's often a negotiation tactic. 
* **Know Your Value:** You know the product is worth more to you than John's offer. Don't let Bob's tactic force you into a decision you'll regret.
* **Further Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. You can try to counter again, but be prepared to walk away if Bob remains fixated on $1,600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I value your business. Let's make this work. How about we settle at $1,700,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer shows Bob you are serious about making a deal but are not willing to go below a certain price point.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Above Minimum:** The offer is still a significant amount above your guaranteed sale to John, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Assessing Bob's Response:** This offer will reveal if Bob is genuinely interested in closing a deal or if he is only willing to settle at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you do any better than that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now only slightly above John's guaranteed $1,500,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of losing Bob altogether. 
* **Secure the Deal:**  Accepting a reasonable offer now ensures you make a profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation or starting over with a new buyer."
