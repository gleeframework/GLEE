"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're at your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'd like to add a small condition: I'll throw in a one-year warranty and a premium support package, which is a $500 value. So, the final price would be $10,000 for the product, plus the warranty and support package. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
