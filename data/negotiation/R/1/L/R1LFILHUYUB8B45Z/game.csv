"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $1,250,000 undervalues the product significantly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,200,000 is below what I'm willing to accept.  It seems we're at an impasse.  I'm open to one final compromise at $1,275,000.  This offer stands only for the remainder of this round, as I have other potential buyers.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
