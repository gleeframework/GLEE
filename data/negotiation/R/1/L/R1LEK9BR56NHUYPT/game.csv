"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way above my budget. This product holds value for me, but closer to the $600,000 range. Would that be something you'd consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the value this product can bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, you're right that our valuations differ. To be transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $800,000.  I can see it being a valuable asset, and I'm willing to offer you $750,000.  This is a strong offer, and I hope we can find an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've reviewed everything carefully, and to ensure neither of us misses out on this opportunity, I'm making you a final offer. I'm willing to close the deal at $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value this product will bring to your business in the long run. Let's make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
