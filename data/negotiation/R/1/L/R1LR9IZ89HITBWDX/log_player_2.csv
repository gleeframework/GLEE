"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is attractive, but it's still above my ideal price.  Since there's a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal, I'll reject the offer and see if I can lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value I place on the product and the value you place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to my ideal price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will refuse and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer allows me to save a significant amount compared to John's price and ensures I get the product."
