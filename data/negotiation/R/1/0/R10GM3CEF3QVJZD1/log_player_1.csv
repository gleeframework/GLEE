"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while ensuring I get a good starting point.
* **Positive tone:** I'm trying to establish a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Room for negotiation:** Leaving room for negotiation is key to reaching a deal. I want Bob to feel like he can get a good price, which will increase his chances of accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a quick deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's room for improvement in the negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price.
* **John is a safe option:** Knowing that John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me a safety net. I can afford to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own value.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and focusing on reaching an agreement. This helps to avoid escalating the negotiation.
* **Highlighting the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer.

**Overall strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal at a price closer to my minimum by gradually lowering my price while staying above Bob's perceived value. I'm also keeping John as a backup option to ensure I don't settle for an unacceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $950,000 is still slightly above my budget.  Let's split the difference and agree on $900,000.  This ensures we both get a fair deal and we can move forward quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time constraint:** We're already in round 4, and it's important to reach an agreement quickly.  
* **John's offer:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is appealing, it's a significant amount of time and effort.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal sooner and move on to other opportunities. 

**Overall:** I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it provides a decent profit while minimizing the time spent on negotiations.  I can always revisit negotiations with Bob if I need to sell another similar product in the future."
