"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a quick deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $950,000 is still slightly above my budget.  Let's split the difference and agree on $900,000.  This ensures we both get a fair deal and we can move forward quickly.",900000.0,Bob,4,
