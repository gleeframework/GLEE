"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to maximize his savings.  He's offering a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still a price that is within his budget and likely appealing to Alice, considering her own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price point, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer.  At $9,500, Bob is still getting a good deal and saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.  It's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a lower price, so accepting the offer is the best move in this round."
