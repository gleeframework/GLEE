"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to consider your budget constraints. However, I have to say that $1200000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $1300000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price.
