"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point to understand Alice's flexibility. While it's a low offer, it leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but $10,000 is still above your maximum price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer moves closer to your $8,000 limit while still leaving you room to negotiate. It also conveys your interest in reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $9,000, which is above your $8,000 limit.  It's unlikely she'll go lower, and you have a guaranteed option with John at your target price.  It's time to go with John's offer."
