Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm not closing the door on further negotiation, implying I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind John's offer of $15,000 as my backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000**.  
* **It's too risky to accept his offer**, as it would leave me with a substantial loss compared to selling to John.
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating**, potentially finding a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while still being mindful of his perceived value. I'll need to find a balance between getting a better price and not pushing him away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $10,000 is still a fair price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a final counteroffer, or move on to John if his offer remains unacceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing John:** If I accept Bob's offer, I'll be settling for a significantly lower price than what John is willing to pay.
* **Potential for better deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum but still considering his willingness to pay. If he rejects it, I will sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on a better deal."
