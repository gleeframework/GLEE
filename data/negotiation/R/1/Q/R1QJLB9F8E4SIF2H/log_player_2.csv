"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget.  He's still better off trying to negotiate a lower price or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $11,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's finalize this deal.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes the most sense to buy from John for $8,000.  Even though Bob might not get the ""best"" deal with John, it's the only way to stay within his budget."
