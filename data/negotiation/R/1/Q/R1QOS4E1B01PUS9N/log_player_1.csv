"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my value, but I'm opening the negotiation with a price that still leaves room for bargaining. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to entice him into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. Therefore, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $900,000, showing some flexibility. However, I'm still keeping it above Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob again, hoping to appeal to his interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm willing to pay. Can we meet at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for now, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly lower than what John is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is still not quite there for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price but still shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $925,000 is my maximum offer. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price, I'm going to sell the product to him.  It's not ideal to have to walk away from a potential deal, but it's better than settling for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
