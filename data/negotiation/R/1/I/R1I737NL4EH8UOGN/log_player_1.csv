Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

Since Bob is willing to pay $150 for the product, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, offering it at that price guarantees a sale and maximizes my profit. There's no incentive to try and get a higher price as I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $150 if Bob rejects the offer."
