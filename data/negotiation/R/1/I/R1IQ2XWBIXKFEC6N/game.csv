"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $9500 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $9500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $9500. How about we try $8800? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, $8800 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9800?",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, Alice. However, $9800 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9200? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price.",9200.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your commitment, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9200 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $9800. Let's try $9600 and see if we can meet in the middle.",9600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, $9600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9600 and $9200, which would be $9400. Would you be willing to accept this price?",9400.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're running out of time, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get at least $9600 to make it worth my while. I'll meet you at $9300, but that's as low as I can go. Let's try to wrap this up!",9300.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final concession, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this price, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",8000.0,Bob,10,
