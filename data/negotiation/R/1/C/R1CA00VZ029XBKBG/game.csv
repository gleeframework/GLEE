"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I know you're also looking for something like this. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it at a fair price, and I'll be able to get a bit more for it than my minimum. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,1,
