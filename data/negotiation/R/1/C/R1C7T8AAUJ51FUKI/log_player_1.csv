Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as much as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120. 
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John if Bob refuses.

Offering the product at $135 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Perspective:** He gets the product for $15 less than his perceived value.
* **Your Perspective:** You make $15 more than selling it to John. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while keeping the offer attractive to Bob."
