"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10500. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer. How about $9800? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it if we can agree on that price.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9800. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $10200. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but I'm not going any higher. I'm starting to think that I might need to look elsewhere if we can't come to an agreement. Can you really consider $9800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
