"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($119) is still above your maximum budget ($100).**
* **You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $100.** 

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and secure the product from John at your desired price point."
