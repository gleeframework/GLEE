Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs to make at least $1,000,000 (her value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  Here's a possible approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting High:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point, aiming to capture a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Alice provides a brief but compelling reason for the price, emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential benefits.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate if he's inclined.  It's unlikely Bob would reject this offer outright, knowing he'd lose out on a valuable product. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. Alice could adjust her strategy based on her knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
