"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle on $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  While I want to find a solution, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  My final offer is $1,275,000.  This is a fair deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
