Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Knowing how beneficial it could be, I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer while staying within a profitable range.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to accept a higher price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving us with a comfortable profit margin above John's offer."
