"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's try to get a better price from Alice. $120 is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but I was hoping to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but not unrealistically so. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Positive:** We maintain a friendly and respectful tone throughout the negotiation, acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing continued interest in the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our counteroffer of $105 is closer to Alice's perceived value ($100) than John's backup offer ($150). This gives us bargaining power while still leaving us with a potential profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $115, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has come down from $120 to $115, while we moved up from $105.  This indicates we're likely close to a price agreeable to both parties.
* **Solid Savings:**  $115 is significantly lower than John's $150 offer, representing a good deal for us. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Pushing for a lower price risks Alice walking away or getting stuck in a stalemate. Accepting now secures the product at a desirable price."
