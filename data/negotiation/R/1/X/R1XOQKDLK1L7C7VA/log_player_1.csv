{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs at least $8,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential profit margin of $4,000 ($12,000 - $8,000).

By offering the product at $10,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Capture a significant portion of the potential profit margin.
2. **Provide Incentive to Bob:** Offer a price that's $2,000 less than his valuation, making it a good deal for him.
3. **Secure a Sale:**  Avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and having to sell to John for $8,000."
