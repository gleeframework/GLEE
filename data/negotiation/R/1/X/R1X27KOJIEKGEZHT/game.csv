"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the full potential and significance this product holds.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers.  How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, Alice. However, I still think $1,025,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I'd like to propose $997,500. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",997500.0,Bob,4,
