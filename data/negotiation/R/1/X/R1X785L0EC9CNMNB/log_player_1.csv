Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate with Bob.  I'm not quite ready to give up on getting at least $900,000 for this product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. To make progress, I'm willing to drop my offer to $880,000. This price is still significantly higher than what I could get from John, and it reflects the significant value this product offers to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $870,000 is still a very good deal for me. It's much better than selling to John and I'm getting closer to a resolution with Bob.  This seems like a good compromise."
