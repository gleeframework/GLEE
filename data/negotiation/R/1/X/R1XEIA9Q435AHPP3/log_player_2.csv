"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we value it at $10000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
