Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and adjusting the price to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
