"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and adjusting the price to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the budget. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it can bring you. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
