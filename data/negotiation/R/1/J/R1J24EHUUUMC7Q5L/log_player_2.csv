{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $115.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $100, and I'm willing to pay up to $120. I'm offering $105 as a starting point for negotiation, which is a reasonable compromise. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within my budget of $120, and I have already rejected her previous offer of $115. It's a reasonable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or a breakdown in the deal.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
