Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to go lower. You aim to get the highest possible price from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** By starting at your desired price, you establish a firm stance. Bob might accept, or it opens the door for negotiation.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: This phrasing adds perceived value, suggesting Bob is getting special treatment."
