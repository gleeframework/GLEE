Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special discounted price of $11,000. I think it would be a great fit for you, but if you're not interested, that's okay! I have another buyer lined up."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell to John for $12,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($11,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. It's a significant discount while still netting you a profit above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning another buyer subtly implies the product is desirable and encourages Bob to act quickly."
