"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum value:** This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **It's ambitious:**  If Bob is genuinely interested, he might be willing to pay a premium.

This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially begin a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating. 

* **Reasoning:** I believe there's still room for a better deal.  I can likely get closer to my initial offer of $10,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. 

* **Reasoning:**  This offer is very close to my desired price point and significantly better than selling to John.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit."
