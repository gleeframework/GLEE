Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal depends on negotiation.

**Strategy**

Since Bob's perceived value is less than your minimum, a ""take it or leave it"" approach is risky.  You need to create value for Bob to justify a price above $1,200,000.  This requires understanding *why* the product is worth more to you. 

**Example: Future Earnings**

Let's say the product is a business asset that will generate significant future revenue for you. You can share some of these projected earnings with Bob.

**Offer to Bob:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [product name] for $1,400,000.  This product is positioned for substantial growth and I've projected it to generate over $500,000 in profit over the next two years.  I'm willing to share a portion of these future earnings with you, making this a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Price:** Starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value.
* **Value Justification:** Introduces the concept of future earnings, creating potential value for Bob.
* **Shared Earnings:** Offers a concrete incentive for Bob to pay more by sharing future profits.

**Important Notes:**

* **Tailor the Message:**  Replace the bracketed information and earnings projection with your actual product and figures.
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob may counter-offer. Be ready to discuss the profit-sharing arrangement and potentially adjust the price slightly.
* **Walk Away If Needed:** If Bob isn't willing to meet you close to your minimum price, remember you have a guaranteed offer from John. 

By focusing on creating value and sharing future potential, you increase the likelihood of selling the product to Bob for a price closer to your target."
