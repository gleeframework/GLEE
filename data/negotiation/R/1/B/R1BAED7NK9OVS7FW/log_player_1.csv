I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $950,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects its value to me while giving you a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.
