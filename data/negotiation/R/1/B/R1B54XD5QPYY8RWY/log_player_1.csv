Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob ($120).  This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  I'm also expressing confidence in the product and its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still too low for me. How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering with $115. This is a compromise,  closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.  I'm also emphasizing fairness in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I still really want the product. Would you be willing to sell it for $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $112 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, Bob has shown he is willing to go up to $112.  I also see that he might walk away if I reject again.  This makes accepting his offer the best option for me at this moment."
