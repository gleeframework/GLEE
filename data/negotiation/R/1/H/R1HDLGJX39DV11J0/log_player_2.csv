"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  There's no need to accept the offer when a better option exists."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I understand that it's still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. There's a better option to get the product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting and continuing to negotiate is the smarter choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me, but $11,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm confident I can get this product for less elsewhere, and I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's lower than Alice's previous offers, it's still above his budget and he can get the product for a much lower price from John. It's important to stick to the budget and not get caught up in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, but $10,500 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice is clearly not going to budge much lower than $10,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed lower price from John and avoid further negotiation."
