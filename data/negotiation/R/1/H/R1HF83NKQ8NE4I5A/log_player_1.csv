"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation but still secure a decent profit. I'm also being friendly and encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly below what I need.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can push closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $9,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. The offer from John is a safety net, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference again - how about $9,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about we try $8,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low. I'm determined to get a better price and I'm confident I can still get it, even if I have to counteroffer a few more times. It's not ideal, but I'm confident in my negotiation skills."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be economical, but $8,800 is just too low for me. Let's compromise one last time â€“ how about $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go above $8,500. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is below my minimum. While I'm not happy to give up on the negotiation with Bob, I'm running out of time and rounds.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a price that's too low for me."
