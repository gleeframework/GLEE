"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm framing the offer as a great deal to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Room for counteroffers:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counter without immediately going to my bottom line. 

**Note:** This is just the first round. I'll be assessing Bob's response and adjusting my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and is willing to pay more than his perceived value. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **Time to counter:** I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $17,000 to $14,000, but it's still above Bob's offer.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to encourage a deal.
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, showing that I'm willing to work with Bob.

**Note:** I'm still within my minimum acceptable price range.  This counteroffer balances my need to earn a decent price with the desire to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  I want to get the best possible price, but I also need to consider the risk of Bob rejecting further offers. With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate, as Bob is willing to pay more than his initial perceived value. 

**Next steps:** I'll counter with a slightly lower price to try to close the deal. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if I don't get closer to my desired price soon."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your coming up on your offer. $13,000 is closer, but I'm still a little short of my goal. I'm willing to go down to $13,500 as a final compromise. This gives you a great deal, and gets me closer to my target. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm showing a strong commitment to closing the deal by offering a final compromise at $13,500.
* **Strong Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing the ""great deal"" he's getting.
* **Closing the Deal:** This offer is close to Bob's last offer, increasing the chances of a deal while still getting me above my minimum acceptable price. 

**Note:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm prioritizing getting a deal while still maximizing my profit. I'm ready to consider selling to John if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet your target, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While Bob's offer is only $300 below my last counteroffer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of Bob rejecting further offers is increasing.  
* **Still a possibility:**  Bob has shown a strong willingness to negotiate, and we're close to a deal. I want to see if I can get him to budge a little more.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than Bob's, but I'll be prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer or my next counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to go down to $13,300 to finalize this deal.  That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm offering a price only $100 higher than Bob's last offer, showing a real commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Finality:** I'm framing this as a ""final deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiations.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get with this purchase.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to close this deal or move on to John.

**Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept John's offer in the next round to secure a sale and avoid further risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,250, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 2 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal is too high. 
* **Minimal gain:** Bob's offer is only $25 higher than his previous offer.  This small increase doesn't justify the risk of further negotiations.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This is a guaranteed profit and removes the risk of Bob rejecting further offers.

**Conclusion:** Selling to John is the best strategy at this point. It's a sure deal and eliminates the uncertainty of negotiating with Bob in the limited time remaining."
