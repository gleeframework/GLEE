"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $95 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to go to 90, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at 92.5. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",92.5,Alice,5,
