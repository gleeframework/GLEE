{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is less than his maximum, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, and knows Alice's minimum is $12,000. This counteroffer is a good starting point, leaving some room for further negotiation while still offering a price that Alice might find attractive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better price. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob has a clear upper limit of $15,000 if he decides to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still below Alice's last offer, and it leaves space for further negotiation if Alice is willing to go lower. Bob is also mindful of his time limit and doesn't want to waste rounds with offers Alice is unlikely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is steadily increasing her offer, but it's still not within Bob's target price range.  Bob has a limited number of rounds and should continue trying to negotiate a lower price. While buying from John is always an option, there's still a chance to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer again, but staying within his target price range. He is trying to meet Alice halfway,  showing good faith and demonstrating that he is serious about making a deal. This offer is only $400 below Alice's last offer, so it's likely to be more appealing to her.  With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to make progress towards a deal to avoid having to buy from John at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, the negotiation is getting tight. Alice is consistently increasing her offer, and it's becoming increasingly likely that she won't budge further. Bob is also getting closer to his maximum budget. At this point, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and being forced to buy from John at a higher price is too great. It's time to cut his losses and secure the product from John."
