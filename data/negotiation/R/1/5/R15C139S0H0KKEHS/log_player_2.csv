(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can potentially save more by negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation while still being within your budget and significantly lower than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you compared to buying from John for $1,500,000. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Alice might reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John. Accepting this offer is a safe and reasonable choice to secure the product at a favorable price."
