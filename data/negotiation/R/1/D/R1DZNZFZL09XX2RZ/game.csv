"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,875,000. This still reflects the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints.",1875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,875,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident in its potential to deliver significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
