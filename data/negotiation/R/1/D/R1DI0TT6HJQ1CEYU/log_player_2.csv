"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum price of $1,200,000. It's too early to buy from John, as I can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and your own asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still above my maximum of $1,200,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to try and secure a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 4

This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
