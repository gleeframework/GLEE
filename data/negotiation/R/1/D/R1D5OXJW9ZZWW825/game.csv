"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price still reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to go down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $800,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
