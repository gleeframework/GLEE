Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Value-Based Language:** The message focuses on the product's ""unique value proposition"" and potential benefits for Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob's feedback and questions, signaling a willingness to discuss the price further.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You earn a profit of $1,300,000, which is $500,000 more than his perceived value.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to negotiate down towards $800,000, knowing you have a backup buyer.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000."
