"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm not willing to go lower than this, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
