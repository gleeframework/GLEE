"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13000?  That's a good compromise and hopefully allows us to finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. How about $13250? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done.",13250.0,Alice,5,
