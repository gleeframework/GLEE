{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $500,000 is significantly lower than my budget for this type of purchase.

"", ""product_price"": 900000}

* **Justify Offer:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""compromise"" to make it more appealing to Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price to make this purchase truly worthwhile.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** This time, I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between Alice's offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows I'm serious about finding a middle ground.
* **Show Willingness:** The message highlights my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as ""fair"" to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and encourage her to accept."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. After reviewing the situation, I am willing to consider a price of $825000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within a range I'm comfortable with.**  $825,000 is significantly closer to my ideal price than my maximum budget. 
* **We're nearing the middle ground.**  With each round, the gap is closing, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try for a slightly lower price, the risk of further negotiation breakdown and having to buy from John at $1,200,000 isn't worth it. 

By accepting, I'm securing a good deal with a significant savings compared to buying from John."
