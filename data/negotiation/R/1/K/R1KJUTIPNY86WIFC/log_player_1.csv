"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,100,000. I believe this reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's value to Bob's business, I'm providing a rationale for the high price, making it seem less arbitrary. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option open to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, it's a significant drop from my initial ask. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can still secure a better price.  Selling to John for $800,000 is my safety net, but I'm confident I can get closer to $1,000,000 from Bob with some strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my commitment to reaching a deal while ensuring a fair valuation of the product's capabilities."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer to show Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. However, the decrease isn't so drastic that it undermines the product's value.
* **Anchoring:** By sticking close to the $1 million mark, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation in this higher range, aiming for a final price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits, subtly pushing back against his attempt to lower the price based solely on his ""thinking."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchoring on $900,000, but his willingness to move to $950,000 shows he's open to negotiation. I'm still confident I can push for a better deal, aiming for at least $975,000.  The risk of losing the deal entirely seems low at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  It shows you're serious about this deal.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $987,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 987500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a true compromise by splitting the difference between our last two offers, demonstrating good faith and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Justification:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's value to counterbalance his focus on a lower price point. 
* **Time Constraint:** As we're approaching the halfway point in our negotiations,  proposing a compromise helps move the process along more efficiently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. While $925,000 is a good profit, Bob using the phrase ""this is the lowest I'm willing to go"" might be a negotiation tactic. I'm going to test his resolve with a counteroffer very close to his price, but not at his absolute bottom line.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe the potential reward of a slightly higher price outweighs the risk of losing the deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to find a solution.  Tell you what, let's make this simple: $935,000 and we have a deal.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value."", 
""product_price"": 935000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By framing this as a final offer, I'm adding a sense of urgency and implying that this is my best and final price.
* **Small Concession:**  The $10,000 increase from his last offer is small but significant enough to demonstrate my firmness while potentially securing a better deal.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value one last time to leave a positive final impression and sway his decision. 

This is a calculated risk.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept his previous offer of $925,000 in the next round, unless his counteroffer is surprisingly higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to be honest, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to be responsible with my budget. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to be realistic. Bob has not budged significantly from his $925,000 offer, and even trying to split the difference again might not get me a better deal. Accepting his offer of $920,000 secures a substantial profit ($120,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of the deal falling apart completely in the last two rounds.  It's always better to walk away with a good deal than to risk it all for a slightly better one."
