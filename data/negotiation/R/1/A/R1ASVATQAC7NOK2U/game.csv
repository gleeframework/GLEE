"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,325,000. This is my final counteroffer.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
