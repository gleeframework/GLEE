Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be of great use to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she knows Bob won't pay more than its value to him ($10,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting Alice closer to her desired price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so she doesn't need to desperately lowball the price. 

This strategy aims for a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
