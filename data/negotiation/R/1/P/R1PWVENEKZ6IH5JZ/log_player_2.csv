Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than my initial counteroffer of $50. While it's still below $150, I've had several rounds of negotiation and I don't see much room for improvement. Given that I only have three rounds left, I'm going to buy from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product."
