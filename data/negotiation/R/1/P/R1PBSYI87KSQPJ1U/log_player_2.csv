# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000.  It's a real steal, and I believe it's worth much more to the right person.  What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  $8000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and $9500 is definitely a step in the right direction. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Would you consider $9750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.
