"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,000,000",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and  $750,000 significantly undervalues its potential. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal",850000.0,Bob,4,
