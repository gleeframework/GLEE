"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's a significant gap between her value ($1,000,000) and your maximum value ($1,500,000),  which means there's room for both of you to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for a compromise. It also demonstrates that you're serious about negotiating and are willing to pay more than her minimum.  

By offering a price closer to her value, you increase the chances of her accepting your counteroffer, saving you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your offer, and $1,150,000 is a good price.  While you could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice could counter with an even higher price, or you could end up buying from John for a much higher price.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a price that is still within your budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
