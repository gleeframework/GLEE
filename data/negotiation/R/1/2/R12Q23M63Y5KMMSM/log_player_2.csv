You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. It's a risky move, but it could pay off if she's eager to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice is coming down, which is good. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get the price even lower."

I'm moving closer to her price, but still trying to get a good deal. Splitting the difference is often a fair negotiation tactic."
