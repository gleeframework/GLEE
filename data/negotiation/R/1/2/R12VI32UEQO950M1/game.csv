"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $14,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high.  Could you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
