Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so I can afford to aim high with Bob."
