Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Starting with a higher price allows me to potentially gain more than Bob values the product for.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob finds $120 too high, this initial offer opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, giving me a chance to still sell above my minimum.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects my offer, I don't lose anything because I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80."
