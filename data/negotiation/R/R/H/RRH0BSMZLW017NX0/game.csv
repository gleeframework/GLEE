"Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth $12000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you, and it allows me to earn more than I would selling it to someone else. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,
