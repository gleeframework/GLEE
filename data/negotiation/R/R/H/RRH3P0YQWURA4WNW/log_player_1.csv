Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value of $120, but not excessively so.  
* **Below John's Offer:**  The price is still attractively below the $150 John is willing to pay, ensuring you maximize your potential profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between enticing Bob while ensuring you secure a profitable deal."
