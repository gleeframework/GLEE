"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose an even lower price of $1,200,000 is a bit too high, I'd like to propose $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
