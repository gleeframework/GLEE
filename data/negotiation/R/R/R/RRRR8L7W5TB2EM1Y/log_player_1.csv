**Reasoning:**

While holding out for $1,000,000 is ideal, Bob is unlikely to budge much beyond his $830,000 offer. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit for Alice ($830,000) compared to her minimum acceptable price. Continuing negotiations risks losing the deal entirely, forcing her to settle for John's offer which, while matching her desired price, offers no potential for exceeding it."
