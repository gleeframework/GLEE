{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm trying to get as close to my minimum price ($12,000) as possible, but I'm also being realistic about Bob's valuation of $10,000.  

By offering $11,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. If Bob doesn't accept, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below what I value the product at. I'll counter with a price closer to my own valuation, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $10,500. This price still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$10,250 is a bit below my minimum price, but it's close enough to be acceptable. I've negotiated with Bob and have come down from my initial offer. Accepting his offer will allow me to sell the product and avoid the risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer or me having to sell to John at a lower price."
