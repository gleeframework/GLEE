"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $10,500. This price still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? That's the highest I can go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
