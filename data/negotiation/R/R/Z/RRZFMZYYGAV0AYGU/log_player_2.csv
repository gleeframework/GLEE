"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a competitive price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price by counter-offering. While buying from John is always an option, it's more beneficial for Bob to try and negotiate a better price with Alice. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down from her asking price to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for both of us - I get a great product at a fair price, and you get a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still a bit below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $950000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $950,000, he's still getting a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's a reasonable compromise that allows both parties to benefit."
