"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you significant value. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1100000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While your price is tempting, I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm interested in purchasing the product for $900000. This price is still fair for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest less, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product at a price of $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly. Let's try to make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm counteroffering the product at a price of $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1025000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to offer $950000. This price is closer to my ideal range, and I believe it's still a fair offer considering the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we've come a long way, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1007500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to offer my final price of $990000.
