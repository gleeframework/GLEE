"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $900,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the amount you're willing to sell it for. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
