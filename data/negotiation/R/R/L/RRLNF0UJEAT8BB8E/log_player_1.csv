Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have strong interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first is strategically sound.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message positions the product as high-value and in demand. Mentioning ""other parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offered price of $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
