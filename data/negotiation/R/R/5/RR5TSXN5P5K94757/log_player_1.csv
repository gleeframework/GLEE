"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher value for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $105.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  it's a good deal considering the remaining rounds and the risk of having to sell to John for $80."
