"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think the starting price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, the product's true value is much higher than that. How about we agree on $1,800,000? This reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think the price is too high. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,600,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating his interest. We're still significantly above his perceived value and have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground: $1,700,000.  This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,650,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now very close to our desired price point.  While we could potentially push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk he won't go much higher. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
