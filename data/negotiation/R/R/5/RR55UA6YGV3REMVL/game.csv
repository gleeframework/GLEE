"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this investment will yield substantial returns for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  I believe this price is fair considering its value and my own limitations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my best offer, as it represents a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
