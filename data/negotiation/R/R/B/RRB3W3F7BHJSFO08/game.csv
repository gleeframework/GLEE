"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm definitely interested, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and it would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
