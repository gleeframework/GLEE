"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. It's the highest I can go without going over my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a little closer to my minimum price to make this work.  How about we compromise on $9,400?  It's a reasonable price considering the value of the product, and it gets us both closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",9400.0,Alice,5,
