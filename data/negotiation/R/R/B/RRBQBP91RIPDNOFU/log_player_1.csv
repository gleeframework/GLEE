{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but it also leaves room for me to make concessions if necessary. I've chosen to offer a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000, as this is likely to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial assessment, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. I have a backup option of selling to John for $12,000, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. It's the highest I can go without going over my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I will reject his offer and attempt to get a slightly higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a little closer to my minimum price to make this work.  How about we compromise on $9,400?  It's a reasonable price considering the value of the product, and it gets us both closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9400}
