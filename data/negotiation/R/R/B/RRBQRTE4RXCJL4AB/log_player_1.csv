Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than John's offer, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to sell this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $850,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'll be willing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $890,000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. It's a price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm hopeful we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $860,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm worried that Bob is unlikely to budge any further. I've already made significant concessions and don't want to risk losing out entirely.  It's time to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale."
