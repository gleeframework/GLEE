Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000.

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your budget. You can try another counteroffer, but if she rejects it again, buying from John might be the best option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,050,000, which is still above your budget.  At this point, it's best to go with John's offer, as it is within your price range and guarantees you the product."
