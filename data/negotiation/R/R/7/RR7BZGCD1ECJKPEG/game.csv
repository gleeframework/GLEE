"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000 for this product.  Given my value for it, I believe this price is still fair.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
