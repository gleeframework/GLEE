"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $16,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we settle on $14,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
