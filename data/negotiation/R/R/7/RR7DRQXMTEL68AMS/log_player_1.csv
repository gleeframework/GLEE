{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, aiming to maximize my profit while still being within Bob's range of value. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $13,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This would allow me to make a fair profit and ensure you get a great product at a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
