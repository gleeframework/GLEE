"Thank you for offering the unique product. I understand its value might be high, but considering my budget, I would like to propose a lower price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your budget constraints, $950000 is still below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm still confident it will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my current financial situation, $1050000 is still slightly beyond my reach. I would like to propose a price of $1025000. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
