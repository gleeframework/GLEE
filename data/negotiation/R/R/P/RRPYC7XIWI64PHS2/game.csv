"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your minimum threshold and within my budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $850,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $925,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $850,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
