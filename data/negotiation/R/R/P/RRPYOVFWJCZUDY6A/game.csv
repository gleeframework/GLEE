"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're keen on this product, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $8,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,750?  I'm really hoping we can find common ground here, as I'm genuinely interested in this product.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you. Let's split the difference this time.  I'm willing to come down to $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. $8,875 is still a little more than I'm hoping to spend.  Let's try $8,700.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's getting us closer to a deal.",8700.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's meet in the middle one last time. I'm offering the product for $8,800.  This is a good price for both of us, and it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",8800.0,Alice,7,
