{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a better offer than Bob's initial $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still a potential to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're keen on this product, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $8,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,750?  I'm really hoping we can find common ground here, as I'm genuinely interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than my target. There are 6 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can reach a better price with continued negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. $8,875 is still a little more than I'm hoping to spend.  Let's try $8,700.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's getting us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable settling for $8,700. There are 4 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
