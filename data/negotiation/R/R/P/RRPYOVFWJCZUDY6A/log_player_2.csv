"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by counter-offering.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to try and get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're keen on this product, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $8,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than the initial offer, he's still above his target price of $8,000.  He has more rounds to negotiate and can try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,750?  I'm really hoping we can find common ground here, as I'm genuinely interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. Let's split the difference this time.  I'm willing to come down to $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, he can still potentially get a better deal. He's only halfway through the negotiation, so there's room to try and get lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. $8,875 is still a little more than I'm hoping to spend.  Let's try $8,700.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's getting us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's meet in the middle one last time. I'm offering the product for $8,800.  This is a good price for both of us, and it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He has reached a point where he's likely not going to get the price much lower with Alice.  He's already within $800 of his target price, and it's unlikely Alice will come down another $100, as she's already shown a willingness to compromise. Buying from John guarantees the price he wants, while continuing with Alice risks running out of rounds and being forced to accept a price he's not happy with."
