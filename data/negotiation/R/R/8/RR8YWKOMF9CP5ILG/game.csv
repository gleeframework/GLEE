"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $115? That's a fair compromise, I think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $130 is still pushing it. How about we settle at $120? That's the most I can offer.",120.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $125. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,7,
