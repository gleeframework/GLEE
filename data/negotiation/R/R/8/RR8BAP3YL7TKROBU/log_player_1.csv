Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, making the price seem more justifiable.
* **Backup Plan:**  It's important to remember there's a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John if Bob declines.

By setting the initial offer high, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a deal that's significantly more profitable than her backup option."
