"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to be a smart buyer, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,500?  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to pay $9,800, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,150. This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer. How about $10,075? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",10075.0,Bob,6,
