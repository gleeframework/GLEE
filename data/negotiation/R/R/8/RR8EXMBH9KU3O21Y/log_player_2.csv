"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible.  $95 is still too high.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This price is still below your maximum budget of $120, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate without losing too much profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price. While it's closer than her initial offer, you still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's not budging too much.  A counteroffer of $90 shows you're serious about buying the product but are still trying to get a good deal. This price is a good compromise between your last offer and her current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Although you are running out of rounds, you are still better off rejecting the offer and trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're nearing the end of the negotiation and need to make a decision.  $95 is a reasonable compromise that's closer to Alice's last offer and within your budget. While it would be ideal to go lower, you risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn.  It's a good middle ground that balances your desire to save money with the need to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is getting close to your maximum budget of $120.  You only have three rounds left and the negotiation seems to be stalled.  It's likely that you won't be able to get a lower price from Alice, so it's better to buy from John at a guaranteed price of $120 and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
