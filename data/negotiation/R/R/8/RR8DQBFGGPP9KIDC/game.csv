"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am unable to meet your price. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you're looking for.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I need, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This reflects the value you've expressed for the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,5,
