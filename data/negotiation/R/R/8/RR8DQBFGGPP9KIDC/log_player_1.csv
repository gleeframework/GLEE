{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price:** This makes it attractive to Bob, increasing the chance he'll accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I can adjust the price based on Bob's response.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** Bob knows I'm serious about selling and have a firm price in mind.

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. I'll be sure to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not desperate for a quick sale, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. This will allow me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price without losing out on a guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price. This reflects the value you've expressed for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Keeps the price above my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell below $1,200,000, but I'm open to exploring options closer to that range. 
* **Maintains a strong position:** I'm not desperate, and I'm confident in the value of the product.

This will give Bob a chance to reconsider and hopefully come closer to my asking price. If he rejects again, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am unable to meet your price. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm hesitant to accept it because:

* **It's still below my minimum:** I'm not comfortable selling below $1,200,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and I believe I can get a better price if I continue the negotiation.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being reasonable and showing flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I need, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This reflects the value you've expressed for the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows continued flexibility:** I'm willing to come down from my previous offer, but still maintain a strong position.
* **Offers a compromise:**  The $950,000 price is a middle ground between our current positions.
* **Emphasizes the value of the product:** I remind Bob of the product's worth and how this offer is a good deal for him.

This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to reconsider and hopefully accept. If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as my patience is wearing thin."
