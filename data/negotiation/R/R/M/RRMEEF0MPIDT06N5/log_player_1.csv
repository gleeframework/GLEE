{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $13,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving a significant buffer for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, I can adjust my offer while still remaining above my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Plan B:** Knowing John is ready to buy at my minimum price gives me confidence in walking away if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay $11,000 for it right now.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  
* **John as a backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I understand you're interested in the product. While I value it highly, I'm not able to go that low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering its value and what it can offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize its worth and justify my pricing.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm directly addressing Bob's concerns and presenting a concrete counteroffer.

By offering a compromise and reiterating the value, I aim to reach a mutually agreeable price that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Although his offers are getting closer, there's still room for a more profitable deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 allows me to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,200. This is a small step closer to your offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 12200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise by going down to $12,200, signaling my willingness to negotiate further.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the price and make it clear that I won't go much lower.
* **Finality:**  This counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely move on to John.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll be ready to close the deal with John."
