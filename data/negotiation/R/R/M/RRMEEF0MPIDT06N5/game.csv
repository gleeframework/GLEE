"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I understand you're interested in the product. While I value it highly, I'm not able to go that low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering its value and what it can offer. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,200. This is a small step closer to your offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",12200.0,Alice,5,
