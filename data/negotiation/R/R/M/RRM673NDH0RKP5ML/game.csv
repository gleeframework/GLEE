"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, I'm able to purchase a similar product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  To make it worth my while to buy from you instead, I'd need to come in at a lower price point. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to negotiate further. I am now offering to sell the product to you for $925,000. This price reflects a compromise that maintains some value for both parties. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",925000.0,Alice,5,
