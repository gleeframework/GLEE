"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by us. Considering its high quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than what others might pay. Given its value to you, we're offering it at a special introductory price of $100. This is an exclusive opportunity for you to experience the product at a significant discount. Don't miss out on this chance to own something truly exceptional. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her stated value, it's still more than your maximum budget of $80. You know you can get the product for $80 from John.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
