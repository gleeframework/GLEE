"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of them to compromise, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can likely still get a better deal.  Both parties have room to compromise further.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,250. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $11,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's likely to be a drawn-out process.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible option.  Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice backing out or Bob having to pay John's higher price."
