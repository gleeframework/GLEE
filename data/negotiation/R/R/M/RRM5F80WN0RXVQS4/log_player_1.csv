Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $13,000 is below Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It shows you are willing to compromise:** By not immediately asking for the full $15,000, you demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the value I think the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, it's still significantly below your desired price.  You have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to your target of $13,000. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain Value:** $12,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price and closer to your initial offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,000. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $500 below your previous counteroffer of $12,000. 
* **Better than John:**  $11,500 is significantly higher than the $10,000 you'd get from John. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even lower offers from Bob. Accepting at this point ensures a sale and a decent profit."
