"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,000. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible.",11500.0,Bob,4,
