Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the initial offer I made.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000. She's made it clear that $10,250 is her bottom line. Rather than risk her sticking to that price or the negotiations dragging on, it's in your best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000."
