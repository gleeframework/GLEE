{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,190,000. I know this product is highly valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.  Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,190,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for us.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

**Why not other options:**

* **Offering close to $1,000,000:** While tempting, it leaves no room for negotiation and risks leaving money on the table. 
* **Offering $1,200,000:**  This is our guaranteed price from John, so there's no incentive to offer it to Bob without attempting a higher price first."
