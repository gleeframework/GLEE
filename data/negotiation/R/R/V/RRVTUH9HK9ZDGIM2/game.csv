"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I believe it holds tremendous value for your business, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My initial offer is $1200000.  This reflects the product's high quality and potential. I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, recognizing its value to me. This price is fair and reflects the product's potential.  I'm eager to close this deal, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950000 doesn't fully reflect the product's true potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which still represents a significant value for you. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975000 for the product, which is a reasonable compromise.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to close this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal at $1000000. It's a fair price that acknowledges both the value you see in the product and my need to get a reasonable return.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $975000 for the product. This offer is fair and reflects the value I place on it.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $975000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $990000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. This price allows us both to gain something from the deal.  Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $990000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $965000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows us to close this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",965000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to make one final concession.  $975000 is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  This is my last offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us both.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",975000.0,Alice,9,
