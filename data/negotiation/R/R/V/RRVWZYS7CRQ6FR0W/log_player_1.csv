Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I believe it's a great deal and below its true value."", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you should aim to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you can gradually lower the price, knowing your minimum is covered by John.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $11,999 feels significantly cheaper than $12,000 to many buyers, even though the difference is minimal.

**Important:** This strategy assumes John's offer is guaranteed. If there's a chance John might back out, you'd need to adjust your approach and potentially accept a lower price from Bob."
