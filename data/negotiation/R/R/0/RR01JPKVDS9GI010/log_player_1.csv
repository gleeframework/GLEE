Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,500 as possible since that's the most Bob is likely willing to pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 gives a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so she's in a strong position and doesn't need to go lower."
