"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $975,000 still falls short of what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects a compromise on both sides, and it's the best I can do at this point. I'm confident you'll see the value this product brings to your business.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $987,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been very patient and willing to negotiate, but $987,500 is still a substantial amount below my minimum.  To be frank, at this point, I'm seriously considering selling to John, who's offering me $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go. If you're serious about acquiring this product, please let me know if you accept.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
