"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your position, $900,000 doesn't reflect its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  This is my final offer. Let's work together to close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value and potential of the product. Let's find a compromise and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
