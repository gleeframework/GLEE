"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $16,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However,  $14,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to sell the product without sacrificing too much. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,6,
