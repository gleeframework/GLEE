Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $2,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  He's likely to see this as a good deal, motivating him to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust the price based on his counteroffer. 

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still closer to your minimum. You have a better chance of getting a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. This shows you're not desperate and are willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you, while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're not holding onto your initial offer stubbornly.
* **Is still profitable:** You're still making a profit above your minimum.
* **Is close to Bob's offer:**  It's a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal. 

You're  close to Bob's perceived value, but remember to keep in mind that you can always fall back on John's offer if things don't work out."
