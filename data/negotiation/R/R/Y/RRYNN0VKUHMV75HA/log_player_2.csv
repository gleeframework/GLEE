"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you, while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?
