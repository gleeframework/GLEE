"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for this product.  This reflects its value to me, while allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's work towards an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I see you're serious about this product. While $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of what's on offer. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant amount for me and would be a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
