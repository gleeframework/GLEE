Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice is subtly reminding Bob that it's worth a significant amount, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting at selling the product ""publicly"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, showing Alice is willing to negotiate.

By starting at $15,000, Alice gives herself room to negotiate down to a price that is still comfortably above her minimum of $12,000 while maximizing her potential profit."
