Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($120) allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate, even if it's unlikely he'll go above his $80 valuation. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** While the price is high for Bob, framing it as a ""special price"" might make it seem more appealing than an even higher initial offer. 

**Important Note:**  It's highly unlikely Bob will accept this offer knowing the product's value to him is only $80. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit before resorting to selling to John."
