"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to secure a product that will significantly benefit your business.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,000,000.  There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or try your luck with another seller entirely."
