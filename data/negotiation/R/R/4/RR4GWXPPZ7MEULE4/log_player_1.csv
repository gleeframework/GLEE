Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies that the higher price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" signal to Bob that Alice is open to negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice has John as a backup, it's strategically better to not mention him yet. This keeps the focus on Bob making a decision.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:** If Bob accepts the $15,000, Alice earns more.
2. **Open negotiation:**  If Bob counters, Alice can still negotiate down towards her minimum of $12,000."
