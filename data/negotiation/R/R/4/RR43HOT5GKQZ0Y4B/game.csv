"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $8,250?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see where you're coming from.  How about we settle on $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $7,750? This would be a fair price for both of us.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer, but I was hoping to stay closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to do $7,250?  That's a significant price for me, and I'd be ready to close the deal right away.",7250.0,Bob,6,
