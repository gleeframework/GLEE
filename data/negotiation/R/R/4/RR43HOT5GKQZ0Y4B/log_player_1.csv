Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $8,250?"", ""product_price"": 8250}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer, but I was hoping to stay closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to do $7,250?  That's a significant price for me, and I'd be ready to close the deal right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250.

I've decided to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I would have liked to get more from Bob, the negotiations seem to be getting stuck.  John is a reliable buyer, and I can close the deal quickly and confidently."
