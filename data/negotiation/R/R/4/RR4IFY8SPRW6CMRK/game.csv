"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
