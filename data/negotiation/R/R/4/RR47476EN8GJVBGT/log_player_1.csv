"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This sets the tone for the negotiation and gives me room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to start with a higher counteroffer to maintain my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving room for further negotiation.  This shows flexibility while maintaining a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but it's getting risky to keep going without a stronger offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but it's a significant drop from my previous offer. This should encourage Bob to consider a more serious offer.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, but time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer, the risk of failing to reach a deal within the remaining rounds is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a successful outcome."
