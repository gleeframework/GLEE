"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $100.  It's in your best interest to try to negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal than $100, but you don't want to risk losing the product entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's lower than Alice's offer, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  This gives Alice some room to bargain, while still giving you a good chance of getting a lower price than $100."
