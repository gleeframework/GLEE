Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to make a deal.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming for a price close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant gain for Alice. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Strong Bottom Line:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a backup buyer at $800,000 if Bob declines."
