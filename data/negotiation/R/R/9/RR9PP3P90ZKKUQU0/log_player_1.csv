Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. Considering my maximum is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000.  This price is still above my perceived value of the product but allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
