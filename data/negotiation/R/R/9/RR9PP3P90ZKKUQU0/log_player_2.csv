"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before accepting or resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. Considering my maximum is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000.  This price is still above my perceived value of the product but allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering your offer of $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my budget, but it's closer to my perceived value of the product.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer could lead to a stalemate or a higher price ultimately, which would make buying from John a more attractive option. Accepting the offer allows me to acquire the product at a reasonable price."
