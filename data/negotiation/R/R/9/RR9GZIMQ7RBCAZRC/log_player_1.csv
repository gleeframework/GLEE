Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value but still above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Shows confidence:** It demonstrates that you value your product and are not desperate to sell.

This strategy allows for a potential back-and-forth negotiation, maximizing your chances of getting closer to Bob's $10,000 value while still ensuring you get more than John's $8,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below our desired price. We're aiming to get closer to $9,500, which is a reasonable compromise. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to counter with a higher price, potentially leading to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's closer to Bob's offer but still above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Shows flexibility:** Demonstrates our willingness to negotiate, but we're not willing to give up too much.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $250 less than our previous counteroffer, and it's significantly better than John's offer.  It's a good compromise, and we can close the deal without risking further negotiation."
