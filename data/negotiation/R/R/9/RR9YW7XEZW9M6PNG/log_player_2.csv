Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial profit margin, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for $1,150,000, but I'm struggling to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  It's also a good deal for me, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.
