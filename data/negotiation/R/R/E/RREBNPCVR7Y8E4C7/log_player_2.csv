"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You're aiming for a price closer to $80, and there are still rounds left to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is within your budget, but also significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further, while still ensuring you are not overpaying."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 94}

While $98 is still slightly higher than you were hoping for,  we're running out of rounds. At this point, accepting the offer is the best option. It's much better than buying from John for $120 and it's still within your budget."
