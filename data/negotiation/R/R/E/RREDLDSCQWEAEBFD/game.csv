,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product is $800,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the significant value of this product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $850,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $775,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't go below $825,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to achieve my target. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm getting close to my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the market value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",795000.0,Bob,6,
