Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said,  $1,300,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  I could come down to $1,800,000.  I think that's a fair compromise, reflecting the value this brings."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, given my budget and the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has reached his maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Since John is offering the same amount, there's no further room for negotiation with Bob, and it makes sense to sell to John without delaying the sale."
