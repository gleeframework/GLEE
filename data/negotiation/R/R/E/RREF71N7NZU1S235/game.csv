"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said,  $1,300,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  I could come down to $1,800,000.  I think that's a fair compromise, reflecting the value this brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, given my budget and the value you've placed on the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
