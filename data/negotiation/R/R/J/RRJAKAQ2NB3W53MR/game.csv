"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to consider $1200000? This is still a great deal for a product of this caliber.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
