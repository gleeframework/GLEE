Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate. 
* **Is lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation without compromising your minimum profit. 
* **Is friendly and encouraging:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Let me know if you want me to continue the negotiation with Bob or make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110 to make this work for both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:**  Showing willingness to compromise increases the chance of a deal.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're protecting your profit margin.
* **It's firm:**  Calling it a ""final offer"" adds pressure for Bob to accept or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I reach my desired profit."
