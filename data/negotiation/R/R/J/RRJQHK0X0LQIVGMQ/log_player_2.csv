Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $850000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm prepared to come down to $900000.  This price acknowledges your needs while ensuring I can still realize a decent profit. Let's try to bridge this gap.

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to your target, you're still within striking distance of your goal. It's worth pushing further to see if you can get closer to $800,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
