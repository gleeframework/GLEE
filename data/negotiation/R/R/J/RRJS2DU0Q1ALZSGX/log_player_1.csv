"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I have 10 rounds, and John is a guaranteed $12,000 sale if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal. I am willing to pay $10,750 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, but we're getting closer.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to squeeze out a bit more.  We have 6 rounds left, and I don't want to miss out on a potentially better deal by selling to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,750 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000?  That's a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with $11,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to propose a price of $10,800 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly less than my target price of $12,000. We only have 4 rounds left and I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'm going to counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still at $11,000.  We're very close to a deal, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to stick with my last offer of $11,000.  Bob seems to be coming up, and I believe there's a good chance he'll accept. If he doesn't, I'm nearing my ""sell to John"" point. We only have 3 rounds left, so I need to be firm but not overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've been considering our conversation and I think we can reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, we only have two rounds left.  At this point, I'm concerned about the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob.  He may not be willing to budge further, and I'm not comfortable with the possibility of losing money. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my desired profit, and eliminates the uncertainty."
