**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing $925,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings, and it's a fair compromise considering your needs.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
