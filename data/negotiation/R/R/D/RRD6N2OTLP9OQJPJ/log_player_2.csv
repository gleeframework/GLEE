{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his goal of $10,000, and John is still a reliable option. While $10,500 is tempting, there's still potential to negotiate further. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge closer to his target."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,150, which is only $150 more than John's offer.  Bob is very close to his goal of saving as much money as possible.  While he could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal, and he'll be forced to buy from John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's within his budget and doesn't risk losing the deal altogether."
