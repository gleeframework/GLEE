``` 

This offer is slightly below my minimum price of $12,000, but it's still a profitable sale for me. It also gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, I'm prepared to counter his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for that low. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, would you consider $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum price, but it's getting close and I'm feeling the pressure to sell. The value of the product is $10,000 to Bob, so $10,250 is a good deal for both of us. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
