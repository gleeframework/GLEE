"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for your product. This price aligns better with my budget while still allowing me to acquire the item I need.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a good price and allows me to reach a fair deal. Let's close this now.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000 for your product. This price is closer to what I am comfortable with, while still being a fair offer for you.",925000.0,Bob,4,
