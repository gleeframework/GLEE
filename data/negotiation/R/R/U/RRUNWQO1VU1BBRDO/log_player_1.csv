Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you recognize its true value, and I believe it would be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price of $950,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the potential surplus.
* **Time pressure:**  The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency and may encourage Bob to act quickly without overthinking a counter-offer. 
* **Exclusivity:** Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" appeals to Bob's potential desire for a unique advantage.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:** This offer assumes Bob is somewhat flexible on price. If he's known to be extremely price-sensitive, a slightly lower starting point might be strategically better.
* **Relationship building:**  The tone is polite and professional. Depending on Alice's existing relationship with Bob, she could tailor the message to be more personable.

**Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer. Alice still has John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, ensuring she doesn't lose money."
