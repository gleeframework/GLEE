"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, but not the maximum I could ask for. This leaves room for negotiation and also signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price.  It's also important to be friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I can still potentially get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value the product offers you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway in this round, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than his offer. I'm also emphasizing the value the product provides to him, hoping to strengthen my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider $925,000, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target as possible. Can you meet me at $920,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'm still confident I can get a better price, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can squeeze out a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $930,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

I'm offering a counter-offer that's only $10,000 higher than Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm also emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product to reinforce my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but I'm still not there. Can you meet me at $915,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $915,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I believe I can get a slightly higher price.  We've only got four rounds left, so I need to be careful, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're close to your target, but so am I!  I'm willing to come down to $920,000, which is halfway between our last offers.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 920000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my counter-offer. This shows I am flexible and serious about closing the deal, but I'm still pushing for a better price.  We've got only three rounds left, so I need to be firm, but I also need to be willing to compromise."
