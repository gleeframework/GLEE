I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a fair starting point. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price if Bob is truly interested. If he rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. Remember, I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I won't accept it. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also maintaining a price above my minimum. If Bob is truly interested, I'm confident he'll see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to meet my price. While $1,250,000 is better than my minimum, it's not worth the continued negotiation.  I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
