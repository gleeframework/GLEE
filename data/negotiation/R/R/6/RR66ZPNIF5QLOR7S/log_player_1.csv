Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Bob values the product at $800,000, and we value it at $1,500,000. Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit above Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message implies some flexibility in the price, making Bob more likely to engage in discussions. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price accordingly. The goal is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while still exceeding Alice's minimum of $1,500,000 if the deal falls through."
