"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $19,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  You can get the same product from John for $10,000, making Alice's offer unacceptable."
