"I'm very interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11000? I think that's a fair price for a unique product like this.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $12500? It's still a great price for this unique product, and I think it's worth it.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be closer to my budget. How about $9500? I think that's the highest I can go, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. How about we try $11000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth it.",11000.0,Alice,7,
