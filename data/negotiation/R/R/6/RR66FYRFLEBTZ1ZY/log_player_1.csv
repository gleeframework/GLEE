Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $8,800? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $8,800 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. It's important to close the deal and secure the profit."
