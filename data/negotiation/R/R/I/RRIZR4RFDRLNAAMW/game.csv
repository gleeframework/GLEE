"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a great starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering we both want to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $1,050,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
