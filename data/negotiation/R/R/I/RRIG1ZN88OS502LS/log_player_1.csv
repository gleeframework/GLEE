"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my target price, as this is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I know Bob values it at $1,000,000, so he'll likely reject this offer. However, this sets the stage for negotiations and lets him know my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,100,000, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer than before, it's still significantly lower than my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

I'm offering $1,050,000, which is right in the middle of our valuations. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John. 

We're at round 6 and Bob keeps offering below my minimum acceptable price.  While there's a chance he might come closer, there's also a risk we'll run out of rounds before he reaches my target.  It's more reliable to secure the sale with John for my desired price."
