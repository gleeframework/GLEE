"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I still have rounds to go and can potentially get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair compromise and reflects the value we both place on this product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $900,000. I'll see if I can convince Bob to increase his offer a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. Let's go with $875,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had enough.  Bob isn't budging from his offer, and we've already gone through a few rounds.  I don't want to risk losing out on a better price. It's time to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
