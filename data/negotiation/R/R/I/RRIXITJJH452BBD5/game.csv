"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit. Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair compromise and reflects the value we both place on this product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. Let's go with $875,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,6,
