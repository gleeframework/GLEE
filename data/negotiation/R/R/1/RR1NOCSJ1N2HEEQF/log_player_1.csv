"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'll find very valuable. My asking price is $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, but still above my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while showing I'm serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not under pressure to sell immediately. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm still above my minimum but showing flexibility.  I want to keep Bob engaged and see if we can meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $130. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 below my desired price, and I've already come down from my initial offer.  There's a risk I might not get a better deal in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to lose the sale.  It's better to secure a deal at this point."
