"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure $13,250 is quite in my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
