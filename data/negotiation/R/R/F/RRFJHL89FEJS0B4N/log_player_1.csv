Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable profit margin for Alice while leaving room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for in a product like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's goal is to maximize her profit.  While Bob's offer of $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  She should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There's still room for negotiation, and selling to John for $10,000 remains a viable option if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** Alice is meeting Bob halfway by reducing her price to $9,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Reasoning:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and justifies the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for further discussion, suggesting that Alice is willing to negotiate further but only within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Further negotiation might risk losing Bob altogether, as he seems firm on his position.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $10,000 would be better, but it's not guaranteed. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that's still profitable. 

While Alice might prefer $10,000, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of getting nothing and ensures a reasonable profit."
