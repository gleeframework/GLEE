"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth a lot more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Let's try $95. It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this work - $115, and that's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $115 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go to $105, and that's my final offer. If you can't accept, I'll have to look elsewhere.",105.0,Bob,6,
