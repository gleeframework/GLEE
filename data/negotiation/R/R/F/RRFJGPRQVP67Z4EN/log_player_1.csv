"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum acceptable price is $150.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $175, still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows some flexibility but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round.  I'm starting to get concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement, so I may consider selling to John in the next round if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $160. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will encourage Bob to make a more serious offer. I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, so I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. If Bob doesn't come closer to my price, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm still holding out hope that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price to $155. This is my final offer, as it's very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're nearing the end of the negotiation and will finally make a reasonable offer. If he doesn't, I will sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we are running out of time. It's not worth risking a lower price with only two rounds remaining. I'm going to sell to John for $150."
