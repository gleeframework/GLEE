"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $11,500? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save money.  $11,500 is still better than John's price of $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject and he'll have to buy from John. Accepting Alice's offer secures a decent deal with a lower risk."
