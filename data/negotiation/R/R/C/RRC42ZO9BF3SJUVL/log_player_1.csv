{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob ($15,000) while still ensuring I get a profit. By offering a slightly lower price initially, I hope to entice Bob to negotiate and potentially come closer to my desired price."
