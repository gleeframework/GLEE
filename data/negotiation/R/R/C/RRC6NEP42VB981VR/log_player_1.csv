{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum, but I'll see if I can get him to move a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value to you, I believe $1,350,000 would be a fair compromise.  It leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
