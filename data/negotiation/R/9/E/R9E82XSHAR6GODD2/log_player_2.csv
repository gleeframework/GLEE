"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning this product and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly better than John's.**  While you value the product at $1,500,000, Alice is willing to sell it for $900,000. This saves you $600,000.
* **There's no need to risk rejecting Alice's offer.**  You're guaranteed a better price with Alice than with John.  There's no incentive to gamble on the possibility of a better offer later."
