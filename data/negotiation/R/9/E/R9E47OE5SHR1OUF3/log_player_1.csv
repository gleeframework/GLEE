Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still offering me a profit above my minimum value.  I'm confident that John's offer of $100 provides me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm willing to sell to John for $100, I'm not going to accept $90 from Bob. This is below my minimum value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum value of $100, but also shows flexibility to Bob. It's a reasonable midpoint between my initial offer and his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $100,  Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum value. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob. I'll sell the product to John for $100."
