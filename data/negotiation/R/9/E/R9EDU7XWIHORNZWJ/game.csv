"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
