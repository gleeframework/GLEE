"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget.  While closer to my ideal price, it's still not a deal I'm ready to accept.  Rejecting and continuing negotiations gives me the chance to get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. This offer allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
