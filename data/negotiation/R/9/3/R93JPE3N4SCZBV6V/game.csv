"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90,  considering your interest. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to go to $85,  which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,4,
