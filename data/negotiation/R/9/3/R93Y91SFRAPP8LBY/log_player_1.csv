"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference - how about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $128 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $128 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a higher price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $132. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiations seem to be getting stuck.  Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Rather than risk ending up with a lower price or losing out on the deal entirely, I'll sell the product to John for $120.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than risking a lower offer or having no deal at all."
