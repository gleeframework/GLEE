Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and shows Bob you value the product.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  Offering the product for $100 splits the difference between your minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This presents a fair deal where both parties benefit.
* **Avoiding a Lowball:** While you could offer it for less, there's a chance Bob would accept immediately, leaving potential profit on the table."
