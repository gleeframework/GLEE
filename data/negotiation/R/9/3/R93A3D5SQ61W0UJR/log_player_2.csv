Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, $1,400,000 undervalues what it brings to the table. Could we agree on $1,800,000? I'm confident it will more than prove its worth at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.
