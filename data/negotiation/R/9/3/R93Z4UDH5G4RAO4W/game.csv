"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1250000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1280000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable.  Let's close this deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm starting to think I can get it cheaper elsewhere. I'll meet you at $1200000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
