Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $125, which is above my minimum of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, reminding him that he would be getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, which is important in a back-and-forth scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'd be willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my ideal selling price. I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $110 is a good price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $115?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm raising the price slightly, showing that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower offer.
* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a middle ground, which can make the offer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, which can help him see that $115 is still a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Ideal:**  Bob's offer of $112.5 is only $2.50 away from my previous counteroffer of $115.  It's getting very close to my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I would be left with only John's $100 offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out, and time is valuable. 

Given these factors, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a price that is very close to my ideal."
