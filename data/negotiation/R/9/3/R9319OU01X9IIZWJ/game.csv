"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $15,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $17,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $16,000. This seems fair, considering your own value for the product and my budget.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $16,000 just yet. I'll meet you at $16,500. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",16500.0,Alice,5,
