"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation. Bob may reject this offer, but it sets the stage for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm adjusting my price downwards to show willingness to negotiate, but still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's potential for further negotiation with Bob, and I'm willing to take the risk of another round to try and reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit. This price is still above my minimum, but it's also more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, I've reached a point where the potential for negotiation with Bob is dwindling. While $13,500 is close to my minimum, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'm confident that selling to John will guarantee me my minimum desired price of $15,000, which is a safer and more lucrative option at this point."
