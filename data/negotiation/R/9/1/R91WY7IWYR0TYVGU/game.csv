"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we try a price of $1,000,000 even?  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the highest I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,6,
