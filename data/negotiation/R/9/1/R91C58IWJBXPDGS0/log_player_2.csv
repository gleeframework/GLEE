Round 5

# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let's meet somewhere in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we've gotten her down to $85. While we could try to push for $80, there's a chance she'll refuse and we'll end up with a worse deal or having to go with John anyway.  At this point, accepting the $85 offer is a good compromise between getting a decent price and ensuring we get the product."
