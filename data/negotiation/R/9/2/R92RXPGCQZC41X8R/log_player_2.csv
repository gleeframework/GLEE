"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value, I believe it's worth $95 for you. Let me know if this price works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $95 is above your maximum budget of $120. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:**  Start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than what it's worth to her.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  A friendly message indicates you're open to finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $90 for the product? Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $90 is still above your maximum budget of $120.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** You have 7 rounds left.  By rejecting, you can counteroffer again and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $90 is still a bit out of my price range.  How about we settle on $87.50?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly higher price:**  Instead of going back to your initial offer of $85, increase it slightly to show progress and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlight a fair price:**  Emphasize that $87.50 is a fair compromise for both parties.
* **Show urgency:**  Mention closing the deal to encourage Alice to accept."
