"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making a high but reasonable offer. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a significant discount from the product's true value to me, but still a substantial amount. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's previous offer, but still a bit lower than my original price.
