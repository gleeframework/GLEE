"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1600000 is a more reasonable price for this exceptional product. Would you be willing to consider that?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
