Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and his perception of the product's value. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
