"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested. I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price of $1,200,000, so this is your chance to get it for a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
