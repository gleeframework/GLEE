Round 6
Bob's offer:

```

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is tempting, it's getting too close to John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. Further negotiation with Bob might not yield a significantly better result, and there's always the risk he walks away. Accepting John's offer guarantees a good price with no further negotiation or risk."
