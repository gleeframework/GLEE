Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget allows me to only consider offers within the range of $1,000,000 or less. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,150,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations for a fair negotiation.

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum requirement of $1,200,000. I'd rather take the guaranteed sale with John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
