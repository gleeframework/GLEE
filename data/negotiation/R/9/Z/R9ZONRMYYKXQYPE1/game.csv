"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, but I'm only willing to go slightly higher. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1500000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $1200000 for the product, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
