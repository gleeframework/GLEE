"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That leaves us both with a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference one last time at $8,750?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $8,500. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",8500.0,Bob,6,
