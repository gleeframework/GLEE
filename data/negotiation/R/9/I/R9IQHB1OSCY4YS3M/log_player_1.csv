Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a good starting point:** It's higher than your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows value:** It's less than the product's value to Bob, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **It's clear and concise:**  A simple offer makes it easy for Bob to understand. 

If Bob rejects, you'll have more information to work with when making a counteroffer or deciding to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair to me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $120, $105 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than selling to John and still a fair deal for both of us."
