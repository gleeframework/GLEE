Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,000,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and I would like to counter with an offer of $1,200,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 is a substantial sum, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price from Bob. It's too early to settle for John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value of this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and would like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly committed to purchasing the product and is steadily increasing his offer. Accepting $1,250,000 represents a strong profit margin and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away with further negotiation."
