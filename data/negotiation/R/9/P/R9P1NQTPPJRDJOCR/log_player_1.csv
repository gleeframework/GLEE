"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us, aiming to build rapport and encourage a positive response.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going for the full $15,000 immediately, giving Bob room to counter and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price, and the product is worth more to him than $10,500. 
* **Negotiation:** I have 8 rounds remaining to potentially reach a better deal.  
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is secure, I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob. 

**Next Round Strategy:**  I will counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, trying to meet Bob halfway but still securing a profit above $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $12,000 is still well above my minimum, ensuring I make a substantial profit.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a hint of urgency by suggesting that we ""close this deal"" to encourage a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I could do $11,000.  That's a fair offer considering your asking price and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still potential to get a better price.  
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic. If I sell to John now, I'll get $10,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Round Strategy:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly above Bob's offer, trying to inch closer to a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my initial offer. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm proposing a slight increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to close the deal. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, subtly reinforcing the value of my offer.
* **Positive Tone:** Using phrases like ""let's make this happen"" aims to build a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:** This is a crucial round.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round to avoid losing too much potential profit."
