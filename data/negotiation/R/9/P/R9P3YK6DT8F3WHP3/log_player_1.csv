Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet halfway from my original offer at $9,500? I think that's a more reasonable compromise.

Explanation:  While Bob is moving closer to a price I find acceptable, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000. I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It makes the most financial sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
