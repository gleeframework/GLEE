"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget.
* There are more rounds to negotiate. 

It makes sense for Bob to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $11000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12000? That's still a fair price for a product that's worth so much to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* There's no guarantee Bob can get a lower price in further negotiations.
* Buying from John would also cost $12,000.

Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at his budget limit without further risk."
