"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I think we can find a price closer to the product's true value. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a significant improvement over John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Bob clearly sees the product's value and is willing to negotiate, so I'll counteroffer and try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to my expectations, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can still find a fair price. How about $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already in round 4.  Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit,  and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or even a deal falling through.  While I could try to get a few more thousand dollars, the potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing the deal."
