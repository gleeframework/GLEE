Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm happy to offer it to you for $925,000. This feels like a fair starting point given its potential."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($925,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially making him feel more involved in the process.
* **Above Minimum:** The price is significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000), ensuring Alice is aiming for a profitable deal. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the understanding that an overly aggressive initial offer could cause Bob to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). While I want to secure the best possible deal, accepting this offer would result in a loss. It's more strategic to counter-offer and continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, to be candid, $750,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I could work with $875,000. This reflects the significant value I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer doesn't meet Bob in the middle of the initial gap ($925,000 to $750,000) but instead comes down by $50,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates the value Alice places on the product, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  Alice remains in a position to accept John's offer if Bob's counter is unacceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000), ensuring a profit for Alice.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's language suggests this is his best offer, and pushing further risks losing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations has an opportunity cost. Accepting now brings in the money sooner."
