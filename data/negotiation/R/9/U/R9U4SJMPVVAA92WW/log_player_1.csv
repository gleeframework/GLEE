{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I've started with a price of $20,000, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've stated I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer and engage in the process.
* **The Value is Subjective:** I don't know what the product is worth to Bob. It's possible he's willing to pay more than $20,000. By starting high, I allow for potential upside.
* **Plan B:**  I've got John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $18000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:** While $18,000 is still above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000.  
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I'm giving him a clear signal that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Staying in Control:**  I want to stay in control of the negotiation and see if I can push for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $19,000? I'm feeling pretty confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I've countered with $19,000, which is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message maintains a positive and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  By emphasizing the desire to find a price that works for both of us, I'm aiming to build trust and show willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $19,000 is still significantly above my minimum threshold, so I'm still in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $17500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Bob's offer of $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied.
* **Testing the Limits:**  I want to see if I can push Bob further by rejecting this offer. It's possible he's willing to go a little higher, especially since he's already shown interest.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  With John as a backup, I'm not pressured to accept a deal I don't feel good about. 
* **Potential for Higher:**  By rejecting this offer, I can try to  get closer to my desired price of $19,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $18,500?  It's closer to your offer, but still reflects the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $18,500, which is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Building Agreement:** The message encourages Bob to see the $18,500 as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This offer is still comfortably above my minimum price of $15,000.

By making this counteroffer, I aim to bridge the gap between our positions and hopefully reach an agreement. However, I'm prepared to walk away if Bob is unwilling to budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to pay $16500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Too Low:** Bob's offer of $16,500 is getting uncomfortably close to my minimum price of $15,000.  
* **No More Room:**  I've already made several concessions and I'm not sure how much more I can lower the price without significantly impacting my profit.
* **John is the Safer Option:** Given that I'm approaching my minimum, selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a sale at a price I'm comfortable with.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to risk losing too much money in the negotiation. John offers a secure and guaranteed deal, making him the better option at this point."
