I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, so I'm not willing to accept anything lower than $1,500,000.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to sell, $1,400,000 is below my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit to $1,800,000.  This is still well above Bob's offer and closer to my initial asking price. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within my acceptable range.  It's a bit lower than I initially wanted, but $1,600,000 is a good deal considering John would only pay $1,500,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on!"
