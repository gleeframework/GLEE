Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the market. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. Therefore, it makes sense to start with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob. It allows for a negotiation process where we might still land a price higher than our guaranteed $15,000. 
* **Projecting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and potentially justify the higher price in his mind.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. However, given the information, maximizing potential profit means starting with a higher price and being prepared to negotiate."
