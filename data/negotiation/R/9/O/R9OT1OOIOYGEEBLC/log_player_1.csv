Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also significantly below Bob's valuation of $1,500,000, making it potentially attractive to him. This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential to gain a higher profit than selling to John."
