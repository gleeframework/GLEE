Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

Bob is getting close to his budget limit, but he's still trying to save as much money as possible.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While this is close to his budget, he has a few rounds left to try and get a lower price. He is also confident in his fallback option with John, which gives him leverage.  There's still room for a counteroffer to potentially secure a better deal, even if it's just slightly better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

Bob is getting close to his budget limit, but he's still trying to save as much money as possible.  He's very confident in his fallback option with John, and he's sure that Alice wants to close the deal at this point. So, Bob makes a very small counteroffer, hoping that Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's only got one round left, and he's already very close to his budget limit. While he could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept, and he might end up having to buy from John for $12,000.  He's better off accepting the offer and saving a little bit of money."
