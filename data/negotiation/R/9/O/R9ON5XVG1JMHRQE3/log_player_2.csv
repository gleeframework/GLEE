"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  While I'm confident in its worth, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price lower than I would sell it to others.  My offer is $1,500,000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth more to her than to you, and you can get it from John for significantly less."
