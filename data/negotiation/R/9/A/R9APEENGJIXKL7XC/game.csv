"Hey Alice, $13,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only comfortable going up to $11,500.  What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product.  Let's split the difference. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it now.",12000.0,Bob,4,
