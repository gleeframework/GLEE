"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm still confident that this product would be a great fit for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it would bring to your company. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  However, to make this work, I need to stay closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to stay close to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.
