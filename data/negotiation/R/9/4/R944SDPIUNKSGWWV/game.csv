"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I've taken your latest offer into consideration, and I'm willing to meet you at $1075000 again. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1075000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

I'm counteroffering at $1075000, but I'm willing to throw in a 10% discount for a 2-year service contract. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
