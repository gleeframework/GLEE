Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. $120 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for negotiation."
