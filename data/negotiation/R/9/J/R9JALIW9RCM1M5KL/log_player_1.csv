Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $100 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price range. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and find a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $130.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price."
