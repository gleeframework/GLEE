Explanation:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, the increments are getting smaller and he's explicitly stated his upper limit.  It's unlikely he'll bridge the remaining $150,000 gap to reach our $1,200,000 minimum.  Selling to John guarantees our desired profit with no further negotiation risk."
