Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and pique Bob's interest.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
