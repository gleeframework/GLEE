{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob while still aiming for a profitable deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as there's still potential to close a deal closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to discussing further, but I can't go lower than that."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and while I'd prefer a bit more, it's likely he won't budge much further. Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
