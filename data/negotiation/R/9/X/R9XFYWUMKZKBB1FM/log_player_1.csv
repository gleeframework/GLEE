Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $12,000. Would you consider $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could hold out for the full $12,000, accepting Bob's offer of $11,750 is a better strategic move at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner. Waiting longer for a potentially small increase has its own cost.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out the negotiation can sour the deal. Accepting shows I'm willing to compromise and builds goodwill.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could go back to John, there's no guarantee another buyer won't emerge for Bob, leaving me with nothing.  

Taking a slightly lower offer now outweighs the risk of losing the sale altogether."
