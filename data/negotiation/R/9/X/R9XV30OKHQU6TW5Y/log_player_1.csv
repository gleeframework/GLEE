Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much larger profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, the message leaves room for negotiation. You can always lower the price, knowing your minimum acceptable amount is $1,000,000.
* **Confidence and Exclusivity:**  The language used emphasizes the product's value and positions it as a unique opportunity, potentially making Bob more inclined to pay a premium."
