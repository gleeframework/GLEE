Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer, hoping to maximize my potential earnings.  I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob shows interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price, and the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or a stalemate is high. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a price significantly higher than my minimum."
