"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and what I've researched about similar products.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, this product offers significant value that goes beyond standard market comparisons. I'm willing to come down a bit to $19,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $17,500. I think that's a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can meet at this price.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  $17,500 is close, but I need to get at least $18,000 for it.  This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, and that's my final offer. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",17000.0,Bob,6,
