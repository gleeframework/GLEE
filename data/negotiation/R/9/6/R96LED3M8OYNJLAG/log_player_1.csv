Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for much more than your floor price of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:** This shows you're serious about getting a good price, and encourages Bob to counter. 

Be ready to negotiate if Bob rejects your offer. You can adjust your price based on his counteroffer and your desire to close the deal quickly vs. squeezing out the maximum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. How about $850,000? This still allows you to gain a significant profit while ensuring I am able to afford the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your initial offer, but still above your minimum acceptable price. However, rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell. This puts you in a stronger position to negotiate.
* **Explore higher offers:**  You can potentially get a price closer to your initial $950,000 by making a counteroffer.
* **Gain time:**  You have the option to counter and potentially get a better deal, or sell to John if negotiations with Bob stall.

It's a calculated risk, but rejecting Bob's offer gives you more control in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize the value you see in the product, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still offers you a great deal, and we can both walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** You're showing flexibility by coming down from your original price, but not giving up too much.  
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:** You emphasize that this price is still a good deal for Bob while ensuring you get closer to your desired profit.
* **Positive tone:**  You're keeping the conversation amicable and encouraging a quick resolution.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still allowing room for potential further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered the situation, and I believe we can find a middle ground. Would $875,000 be acceptable to you? This would still provide you with a good profit while allowing me to secure the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below your initial price, it's closer to your minimum acceptable price and offers a good profit.  Considering the following:

* **Time is money:** Further negotiation could take longer and there's always the risk that the deal could fall through. 
* **John's offer:** You have a guaranteed alternative of selling to John for $800,000.  
* **Potential for future deals:**  If you accept this offer, you may build a relationship with Bob for potential future transactions.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, minimizing risk and allowing you to move on to other opportunities."
