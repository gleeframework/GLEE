"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a good margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price that still gives you a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price and I think I can get it by negotiating with Bob further. $900,000 is still a good profit, but I want to see if I can push for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low. It's understandable that we have different valuations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a great compromise and allow both of us to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob. I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I think there's room for further compromise.  $975,000 is getting closer to what I want, but I believe I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,012,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we make it a clean $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like more, $1,000,000 is a good deal.  We've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and there's a risk that Bob might get frustrated and walk away.  It's better to secure this deal than to risk losing him and having to accept a lower offer from John."
