"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a good margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than her product's value ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000). There's plenty of room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better price before resorting to John's expensive offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price that still gives you a profit."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer:

* **Starts lower than Alice's offer:** This signals you're serious about getting a lower price.
* **Is still above Alice's value:** Offering $900,000 ensures Alice would still make a profit ($100,000), making it more likely she'll consider the deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  You've left space to potentially meet in the middle if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low. It's understandable that we have different valuations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a great compromise and allow both of us to achieve our goals. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $1,050,000 is still closer to her initial offer than your counter. There's room to negotiate further and try to get the price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($1,050,000) and your previous counteroffer ($900,000). 
* **Stronger Position:** By suggesting a specific price, you're taking control of the negotiation and anchoring the discussion around a figure closer to your desired range.
* **Still Above Alice's Value:**  Even at this price, Alice would still make a significant profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,012,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to hold the price above $1,000,000.  While her concessions are getting smaller, you're still in a good negotiating position.  It's worth pushing a little further, but you might consider accepting if she comes down by a smaller amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we make it a clean $1,000,000?  That's my final offer. "",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message clearly signals that you're reaching your limit and are unlikely to budge further. 
* **Round Number:** With only a few rounds left, adding a touch of pressure can work in your favor.
* **Strong Position:** You're still offering Alice a $200,000 profit, which is a significant return.  
* **Alternative:** You're getting close enough to your maximum budget that you could consider John's offer if Alice completely refuses to budge."
