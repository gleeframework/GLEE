"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my original price is based on the true value of this product.  I can be a little flexible, but $800,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. I appreciate you meeting me a little but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,000,000? That's my absolute maximum.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
