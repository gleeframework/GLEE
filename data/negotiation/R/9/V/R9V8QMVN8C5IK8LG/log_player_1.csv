Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately undervalue the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price is also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, allowing for potential concessions without jeopardizing my bottom line. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive negotiation environment.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a good outcome, earning a profit of $100,000. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll be prepared to counteroffer, potentially moving closer to his perceived value but staying above my minimum. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'll always have the option of selling to John at $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's closer than his initial perceived value of $1,000,000. This indicates he's willing to negotiate, and I can use this to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if negotiations fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $1,050,000 and my minimum acceptable value.  I will try to be persuasive but firm in my counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also have a clear bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest in my product, $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for some flexibility.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise between my initial price of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on a price above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm giving Bob a reason for the price, stating it still reflects the product's value,  making it more appealing than simply rejecting his offer outright.
* **Flexibility:** By stating that the price ""allows for some flexibility,"" I leave the door open for further negotiation if needed. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** This is a good outcome, earning a profit of $50,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will analyze his response. If he's willing to negotiate further, I may lower my price slightly, keeping an eye on my minimum acceptable value. If he seems unwilling to budge, I'll have to weigh the potential of continued negotiations against the certainty of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Middle Ground:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is exactly my initial offer, which I considered a fair price point. This indicates a potential for agreement.
* **Earning a Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer will result in a profit of $100,000, which is a respectable outcome.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While John's offer of $1,200,000 is higher, there's always the possibility that negotiations with John could fail or he might back out.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Negotiation Complete:**  The negotiation has concluded successfully, resulting in a sale at a price that meets my desired profit margin."
