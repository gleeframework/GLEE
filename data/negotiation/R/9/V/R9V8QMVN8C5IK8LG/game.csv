"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest in my product, $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for some flexibility.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
