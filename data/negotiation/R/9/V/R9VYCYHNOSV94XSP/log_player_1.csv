Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal, what do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing your profit slightly. 
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering it for $120 or more would likely result in Bob rejecting the offer, forcing you to sell to John at your minimum price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
