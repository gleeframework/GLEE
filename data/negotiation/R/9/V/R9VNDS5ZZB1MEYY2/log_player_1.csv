"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my target of $10,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8800}
