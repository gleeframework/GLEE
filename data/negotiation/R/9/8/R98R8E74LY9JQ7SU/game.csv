"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $16,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Is this something you'd be comfortable with?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $16,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a lower price.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I can see that you're getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $15,250, which is the lowest I can go. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",15250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $15,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $15,125.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",15125.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a compromise. I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,250, and I think we're close enough to call it a day. I'm willing to meet you at $15,200, but that's as low as I can go. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",15200.0,Alice,7,
