Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's response:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my bottom line, and I'm willing to negotiate further, but I don't think I can go any lower.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

I'd like to reject Alice's offer and send a new counteroffer. I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.

My new counteroffer is $950,000. I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but I still think $1,100,000 is too high.
