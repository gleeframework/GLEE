This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Price is good:** $1,220,000 is a significant saving from both Alice's initial offer and John's price. 
* **""Final offer"" signal:** Alice is indicating this is her best price. Pushing further might risk the deal.
* **Limited rounds:**  You're running out of time to negotiate a better price.

While you might be able to get the price a little lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,500,000 outweighs the potential reward."
