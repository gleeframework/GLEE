Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping he values the product more than $150, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's worth at least $150 to me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $175. This is still a good deal for me as it's above my minimum acceptable price, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to consider accepting, especially since he rejected my first offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground without going too low and risking losing a lot of profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, I'm not willing to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $150."
