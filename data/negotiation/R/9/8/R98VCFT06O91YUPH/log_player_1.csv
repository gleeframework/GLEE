Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 offer:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Ready to counter:** If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to make a counter-offer based on his response. 
* **John as a backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which serves as a safety net and allows me to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. It's also lower than the $12,000 offer I made initially. I'm prepared to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, allowing me to walk away if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.  
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the fairness of the price for both of us.
* **Urgency:**  The message subtly implies a sense of urgency, suggesting a potential need to close the deal.
* **John's offer as a backup:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, allowing me to walk away if this counteroffer is rejected."
