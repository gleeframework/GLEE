,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the intrinsic value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,700,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for a product of this value.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
