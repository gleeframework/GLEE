Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the intrinsic value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,700,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for a product of this value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
