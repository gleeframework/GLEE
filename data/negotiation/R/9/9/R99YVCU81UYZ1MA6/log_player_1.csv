"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point, and also lets Bob know that I'm not just going to accept his low valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to give up on my goal of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, and offer him a price of $11,000. This shows flexibility while still giving me a good profit. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to consider selling to John, as I'm approaching my limit for negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still too low for me. I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price.  The negotiation is getting tight, but I'm not ready to settle for something less than $11,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to make one last counteroffer. This is getting closer to Bob's offer and I'm hoping this will be enough to seal the deal. If he rejects this, I'll be forced to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure Bob is going to budge much further. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but the risk of him rejecting my next offer is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so I'm going to take that option."
