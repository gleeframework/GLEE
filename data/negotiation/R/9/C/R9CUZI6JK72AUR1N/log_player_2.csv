"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $120. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer.  There's room to bargain between $120 and our $150 maximum."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $130?

Alice is negotiating, but we're still quite a way from a price I'm happy with. I'll try one more time to get closer to my ideal price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $125? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Alice is clearly getting firmer on her price, and $125 is a reasonable compromise.  It's getting close enough to my $150 fallback that it's not worth the risk of her refusing any further negotiation."
