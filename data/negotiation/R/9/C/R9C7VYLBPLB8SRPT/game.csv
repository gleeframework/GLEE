"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your offer. That price is a little too high for me, but I'm definitely interested in the product. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $110 is still a little bit of a stretch for me. Could we settle somewhere around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about $95? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair deal too. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $105? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,7,
