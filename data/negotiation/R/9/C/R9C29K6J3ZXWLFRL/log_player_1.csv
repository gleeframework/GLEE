Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob without losing him as a buyer. 
* **Knowing the Limits:** You know Bob values the product at $100 and you won't accept less than $120.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product at $119 is the highest price Bob is likely to pay, as it's just below his maximum perceived value.  
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for your minimum acceptable price ($120)."
