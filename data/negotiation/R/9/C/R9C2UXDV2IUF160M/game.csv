"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my financial constraints.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
