"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Let's see if we can negotiate Bob up a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position on the price, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this price is more in line with my financial constraints and still reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push Bob further, accepting his offer at $1,350,000 is still a significant profit above John's standing offer of $1,200,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiations falling through in later rounds."
