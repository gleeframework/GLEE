"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $90.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd really like to get this product.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90. I'm willing to meet you at $98. It's still a good price for the product, and I think it's worth it.",98.0,Alice,5,
