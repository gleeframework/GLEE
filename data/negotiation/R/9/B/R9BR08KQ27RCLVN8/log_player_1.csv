I've had 8 rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while we've gotten closer to a deal, he's still not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. With only 2 rounds left, I'm not confident that we'll reach an agreement. To ensure I get the value I need for my product, I'm going to sell it to John for $1,500,000."
