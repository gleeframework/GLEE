Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone makes Bob more likely to engage and consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  While brief, the message hints at the product's potential value to Bob.

This strategy balances maximizing my potential earnings with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a Counter-Offer:** I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob. While his offer is below my minimum, it demonstrates his interest in the product and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time is Money:**  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe a higher price is possible with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum while still keeping Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $110?  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone keeps the negotiation constructive.
* **Empathy:** Acknowledging Bob's budget concerns demonstrates that I'm listening and willing to compromise.

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
