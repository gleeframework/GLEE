(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the features of the product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of that, I am willing to adjust the price to $9,000. This still reflects the value and quality of the product, while being more accommodating to your current financial situation. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $9,000 is still above his $8,000 limit.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price lower before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in our product, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a final price of $8,750 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while being responsive to your budgetary considerations. I believe this price reflects the value and quality of the product, and I hope it will allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than the $8,000 he could get from John. There's still one round left to try and get a better price from Alice, so it's worth seeing if she'll go lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close the deal, but $8,750 is still a little higher than I can go right now. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
