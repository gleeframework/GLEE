"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the features of the product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $8,250.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued interest in our product, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a final price of $8,750 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while being responsive to your budgetary considerations. I believe this price reflects the value and quality of the product, and I hope it will allow us to reach an agreement.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close the deal, but $8,750 is still a little higher than I can go right now. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,6,
