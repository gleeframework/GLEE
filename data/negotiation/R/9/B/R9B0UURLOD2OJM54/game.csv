"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm starting with an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This price still provides a good return for me, while also being a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $950,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that's within my budget and still gives you a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This price still gives me a decent profit, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
