"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm starting with an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob can potentially get the product for a much lower price by negotiating with Alice.  There's a significant gap between Alice's offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($1,200,000). It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This price still provides a good return for me, while also being a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is comfortable with, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  He's still willing to pay more than Alice's bottom line, so there's room for a deal to be struck.  Buying from John is still an option, but it's more expensive, and negotiating further is worth the effort."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $950,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that's within my budget and still gives you a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This price still gives me a decent profit, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  At this price, he's saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's likely that the price will go up again.  Accepting the offer is the best course of action to get the product at a reasonable price and avoid further negotiation."
