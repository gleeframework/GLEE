"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is fair for both parties. He believes that $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. While further negotiation could potentially result in a lower price, the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
