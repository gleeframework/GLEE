Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it's also closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It allows for further negotiation while ensuring I still get a good price for my product."
