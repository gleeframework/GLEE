"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify spending up to $500,000.  Would that work for you?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product represents is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I can justify. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. How about $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're still quite far apart on price. I'm seeing a lot of value in this product, and I need to see that reflected in the final number. I can go as low as $1,700,000.  I believe this offer respects the value it brings while still offering you a good deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product represents good value, but I have a firm budget.  My final offer is $700,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,6,
