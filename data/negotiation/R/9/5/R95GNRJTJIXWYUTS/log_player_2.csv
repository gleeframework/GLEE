"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget than it is to her minimum price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating my price target.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's minimum price ($12,000) than my maximum budget ($15,000), potentially giving me more bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is too low for me. Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but there's still room for improvement.  The current offer is $2,000 above her minimum and only $2,000 below my maximum.  I'll aim for a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Fair:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly between her previous offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Reaching a Conclusion:** By hitting her known valuation, it's likely she'll accept, and even if she counters, it will likely be very close to this number.  This offer pushes for a quicker resolution to avoid the risk of negotiations dragging on."
