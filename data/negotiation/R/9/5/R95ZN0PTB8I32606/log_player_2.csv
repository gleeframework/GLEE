Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, considering the product's value. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $110? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $110. It's better to secure the product at the known $100 price from John."
