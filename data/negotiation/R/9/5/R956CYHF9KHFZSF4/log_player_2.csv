"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice's offer is $119.
* You can get the product from John for $120.

It's slightly better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, saving you $1."
