I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000.  This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still closer to my initial asking price. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and come closer to this number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,350,000, which is getting close to my target.  While I'd prefer to get even closer to $1,400,000, the risk of further negotiation might lead to him walking away altogether or me having to sell to John for the lower price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
