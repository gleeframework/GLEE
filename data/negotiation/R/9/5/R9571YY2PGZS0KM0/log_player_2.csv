Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I aim for a fair deal, I have to consider the product's true worth.  Would you be willing to meet at $10,500?

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product."
