"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my range, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is still a good deal considering its value to me is $15,000.",10000.0,Alice,5,
