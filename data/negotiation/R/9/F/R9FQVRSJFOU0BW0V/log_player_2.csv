"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. While it's below her own valuation, it's significantly more than John's offer. By rejecting and countering, I can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a low counter-offer of $6,000 gives me a lot of room to negotiate upwards. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it sets a strong anchor for the negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:** My message is friendly and expresses interest while still clearly stating my price limit. This helps maintain a positive tone for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still above my maximum price and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further before considering accepting or switching to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my range, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Alice countered at $9,000. By offering $7,500, I'm suggesting a compromise that splits the difference between her offer and my previous counter-offer. 
* **Urgency (Without Being Pushy):**  While I'm not explicitly threatening to walk away, suggesting a ""fair compromise"" and ""meeting in the middle"" subtly implies I'm getting closer to my limit and John's deal is becoming more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is still a good deal considering its value to me is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice went up in price, indicating she's unlikely to meet my needs. It's time to cut my losses.  $10,000 is too high, and further haggling is unlikely to bridge the gap quickly enough. John's offer of $8,000 is a sure thing and represents a better use of my time and resources at this point."
