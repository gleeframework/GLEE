Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to anyone else.  I believe it's worth a significant amount due to its unique value, so I'm proposing a price of $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $13,500 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net, ensuring you won't be left with nothing if Bob declines.

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of flexibility, giving you the best chance of securing a great deal."
