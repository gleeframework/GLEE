"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $1,200,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He wants to offer a price that is still attractive to Alice, but closer to her value. A counteroffer of $1,250,000 represents a significant saving for Bob while potentially still being acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer:** This suggests Alice is not willing to drop her price significantly, but she is also not eager to close the deal at $1,400,000.
* **Bob still has room for negotiation:**  Alice's counteroffer is still above her value, and Bob can potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still an option:** This provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail.

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  Alice's counteroffer was $1,400,000, and Bob's previous offer was $1,250,000.  This counteroffer splits the difference, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Still below John's price:**  Bob is staying within his budget and getting a better deal than John's offer.
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:** This offer will gauge Alice's willingness to meet Bob halfway. 

If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can continue negotiating or consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging significantly:** While Alice has lowered her price from $1,400,000 to $1,450,000, it's not a substantial drop. This suggests she's not as eager to sell as Bob might hope.
* **Bob is still within his budget:** Buying from John is still the last resort, and Bob hasn't reached that point yet. 
* **Potential for a compromise:**  Bob can likely negotiate a better price than $1,450,000. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,350,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference again:**  Alice's offer was $1,450,000, and Bob's previous offer was $1,300,000.  This counteroffer meets halfway once again, showing a continued willingness to compromise.
* **Staying within budget:**  This price is still lower than John's offer, making it a better deal for Bob.
* **Testing Alice's willingness:**  This offer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can continue negotiating or consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at John's price:** Alice has now matched John's price, meaning there is no financial advantage to continue negotiating with her.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of reaching a lower price with Alice are slim.
* **Avoiding further risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice rejecting further offers, leaving Bob with no deal.

Buying from John guarantees Bob will get the product at a price that is within his budget, avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiations."
