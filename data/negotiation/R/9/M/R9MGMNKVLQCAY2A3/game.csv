"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but I need to stay within that budget to make this work.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you countering, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be sure this deal makes sense for me too.  How about we split the difference and settle at $887,500?  That's my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair compromise.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $887,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is just a small step away from your final offer.  Let's try to find common ground here.  What do you say?",880000.0,Bob,6,
