"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000 vs $1,500,000).  This suggests there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price by counteroffering rather than accepting or buying from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  It also leaves room for further negotiation, as I still have 9 rounds remaining. By offering a lower price, I'm aiming to force Alice to reconsider and potentially lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target, it's still too high. I'm still willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price. I have 7 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the potential for negotiation and my current budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price. It's a smaller step down from Alice's offer, indicating a gradual compromise.  It also leaves room for further negotiation as I have several rounds left. The goal is to find a mutually agreeable price without jeopardizing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,080,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now very close to my target price.  I have 5 rounds left, but it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, Alice might get frustrated and refuse to negotiate further, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good deal without risking the entire negotiation."
