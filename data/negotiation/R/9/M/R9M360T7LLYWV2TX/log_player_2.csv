"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget and allows you to save $100,000. This is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000."
