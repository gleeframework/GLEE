"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  how about $7,500?  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but $7,500 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $6,750 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $7,000? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",7000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $6,800. I believe this is a fair price and reflects my budget constraints.",6800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I see you're serious about acquiring this product. While I'm willing to compromise, I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm prepared to accept $6,900 for the product. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on.",6900.0,Alice,7,
