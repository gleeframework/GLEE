"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! Unfortunately, that's a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a price closer to my $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down a bit, but $110 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate a bit closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about $90? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm inching closer to Alice's price, showing I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price that saves me money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can do $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105. While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her raising the price or me missing out entirely. Buying from John for $100 guarantees I get the product at the best possible price."
