Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to get the highest price possible. Starting high gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer is just below my guaranteed price, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the value proposition for Bob, making the price more palatable. 

**It's a delicate balance:** I want to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough to accept, but not so low that I leave a significant amount of money on the table."
