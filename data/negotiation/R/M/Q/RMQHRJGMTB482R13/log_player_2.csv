"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $150. This is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

Bob should offer the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is $80.  This sets the baseline for the negotiation.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it demonstrates Bob's seriousness and gives him room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as there are still rounds left, and potentially more room for a price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

Bob should continue to gradually increase his offer.  $90 is a reasonable compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $125 is still outside his comfort zone.  There are still rounds left, and Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if he can get the product for closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but not by too much. $100 is a good middle ground, showing that he's willing to compromise but also not giving in too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There are only 3 rounds left, so Bob needs to be strategic.  He should try to find a middle ground that both he and Alice can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

Bob should offer $110. This is a small increase from his previous offer, showing willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's likely Alice will accept, but if she rejects, Bob will still have a round left to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's now Round 9, and Alice is offering $118.  While this is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum of $80.  With only one round left, the chance of getting Alice to accept a lower offer is slim.  

Therefore, Bob should buy the product from John for $80. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of a last-minute negotiation failure."
