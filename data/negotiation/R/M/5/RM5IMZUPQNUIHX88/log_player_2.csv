# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,250,000 is far beyond what I'm able to pay. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This offer reflects my serious interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal.  While I recognize you see the value in this product, my original price is firmly grounded in its potential and market worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,950,000.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. It's worthwhile to keep negotiating and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Given my previous offer of $1,200,000 and your willingness to negotiate, I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and allows us to move closer towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer demonstrates a serious interest in reaching an agreement, and I respect that. I've tried to reflect my own willingness to find common ground in my previous offers. To be entirely transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase the product for $1,500,000. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our ongoing conversation. So, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and she's clearly not willing to come down much further. Given that you have a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000, it's better to avoid further negotiation and secure the product from John."
