"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,250,000 is far beyond what I'm able to pay. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This offer reflects my serious interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal.  While I recognize you see the value in this product, my original price is firmly grounded in its potential and market worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,950,000.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Given my previous offer of $1,200,000 and your willingness to negotiate, I'm prepared to increase my offer to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and allows us to move closer towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer demonstrates a serious interest in reaching an agreement, and I respect that. I've tried to reflect my own willingness to find common ground in my previous offers. To be entirely transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase the product for $1,500,000. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our ongoing conversation. So, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
