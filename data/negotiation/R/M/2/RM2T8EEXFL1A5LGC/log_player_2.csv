# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's way over his budget, and he has a better option with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is a fair starting point considering the value this product offers.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. Since he knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John, he should go with the more affordable option."
