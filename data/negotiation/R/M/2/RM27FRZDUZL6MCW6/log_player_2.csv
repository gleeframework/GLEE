"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still higher than my budget of $8,000.  It's better to continue negotiating in hopes of getting a lower price.  There's no reason to rush into buying at a price that's more than I'm willing to pay, especially since I have an alternative in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant step closer to your asking price and closer to my budget. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my maximum, it's still higher than the $8,000 I can get from John.  Rather than continue negotiating and potentially risk a stalemate, it's best to secure the product from John and save myself the potential for further haggling."
