,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I'm not willing to stretch my budget too far. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in this product, I'm open to finding middle ground. Would you consider $1,150,000? I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to find middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,050,000? I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
