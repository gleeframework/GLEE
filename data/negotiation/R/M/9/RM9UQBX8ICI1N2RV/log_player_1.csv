Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate a bit. If he rejects, I can always go lower or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $80. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial $90 offer but still above Bob's $75 offer. It's a fair price considering my minimum price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $82.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum of $80 and closer to my initial goal.  Further negotiation might get me a few dollars more, but it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
