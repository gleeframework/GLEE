Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. "",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is strategically sound.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $925,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It creates the impression that the product is highly sought after.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price allows me to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, while still securing a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:**  While I don't explicitly mention John, the message implies a sense of urgency and exclusivity, suggesting Bob might miss out if he hesitates."
