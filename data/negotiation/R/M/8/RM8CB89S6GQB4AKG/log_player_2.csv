You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since Alice is offering the product for the exact same price that John is offering, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate with her later or simply go with John if you're happy with that price. There's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
