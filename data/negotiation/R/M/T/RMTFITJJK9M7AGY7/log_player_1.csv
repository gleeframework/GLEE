I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for myself."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a counteroffer of $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it is a fair price that could potentially lead to an agreement."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get a little more,  $132 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
