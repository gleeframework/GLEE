Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $4,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the value of your product, but you're also open to compromise. 

By starting with a high price and being open to negotiation, you increase your chances of getting closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is a decent profit, it's still significantly lower than the potential value of the product to Bob, and you could likely get more by continuing to negotiate.  

You can use this information to your advantage in the next round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to accept $12,500. This would still leave you with a good amount of value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show compromise:** It's lower than your initial offer, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Be within the acceptable range:**  It's still higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Maintain a good profit margin:**  It would still give you a decent profit margin ($2,500).

By offering $12,500, you're demonstrating a willingness to find a middle ground, hopefully, leading to a successful sale without having to go through further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $11,750? That's a fair compromise, and I can close the deal today at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $11,750 is a good compromise. It's a substantial profit for me, and it's likely that further negotiation would only lead to a minor increase in price. Selling to Bob now is the best option to secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
