"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is quite high, there's room for negotiation to lower the price significantly."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to accept $12,500. This would still leave you with a good amount of value. What do you think?

While closer to a reasonable price, Alice's counteroffer still leaves room for negotiation. We're aiming for $11,000 or lower, and moving closer to that goal is preferable to taking the John option at this stage."
