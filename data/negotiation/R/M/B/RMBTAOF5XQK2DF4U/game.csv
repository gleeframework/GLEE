"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $70 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $85?  I'm really hoping to make this work, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit higher than you'd like to pay, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
