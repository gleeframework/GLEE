Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,150,000 sits comfortably above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while still leaving room for Alice to profit substantially more than John's offer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and framing it as a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and importance, potentially swaying Bob to act quickly."
