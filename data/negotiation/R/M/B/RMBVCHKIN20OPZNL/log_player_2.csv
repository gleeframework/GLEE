Round 3
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly stuck at a price point that's not beneficial for us. She's gone down in small increments, but it's unlikely she'll reach a price close enough to $80 to make it worth continuing the negotiation.  We have a guaranteed offer from John at $80, so it's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing."
