Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $120?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I understand his position, $120 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to hold out for a bit longer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still interested in selling to you, but $120 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $122? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 122}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm sorry to hear that $122 isn't feasible. I'd like to stick to my original offer of $120. Is there any way we could meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $120.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  This is a reasonable price, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
