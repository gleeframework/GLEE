"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I'm willing to throw in a bonus feature that's worth $25. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
