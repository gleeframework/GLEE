Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid the product's value to me is much higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is my best counteroffer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18,000. However, it's still too high for me.

I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation. However, $10000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16000. This is my best compromise for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $12000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17000. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is coming down, but not enough.  You've been negotiating for a while and you're close to your maximum budget. It's time to cut your losses and go with John. You'll save $9,000 by buying from him."
