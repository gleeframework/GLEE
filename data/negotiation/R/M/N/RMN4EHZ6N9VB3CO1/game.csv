"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $975,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
