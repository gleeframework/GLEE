Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we both see the value in this product.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point, but I value our discussions.  My final offer is $1,500,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,500,000. It's her final offer and she has another buyer. You can save a significant amount ($700,000) by going with your backup plan and buying from John."
