"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000 to begin our conversation.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. How about we bring it down to $600,000 and go from there?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,350,000. This reflects my seriousness while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but we're still quite far apart. I'm serious about this purchase, but it needs to work within my budget.  Could you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still substantial.  I'm open to finding a solution, but I need to see a more serious offer. To be frank, I have other options for this product, but I believe in its value for you. My final offer is $1,200,000. This is non-negotiable.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
