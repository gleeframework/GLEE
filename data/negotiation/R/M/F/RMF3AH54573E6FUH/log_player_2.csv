Round 2

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. How about we bring it down to $600,000 and go from there?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,350,000. This reflects my seriousness while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still substantial.  I'm open to finding a solution, but I need to see a more serious offer. To be frank, I have other options for this product, but I believe in its value for you. My final offer is $1,200,000. This is non-negotiable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now presented her ""final offer"" and it's non-negotiable. At $1,200,000, the price is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price."
