"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000 to begin our conversation.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'm starting significantly higher ($1,600,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, I'm setting an ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind. Even if he counters much lower, the initial high price might make his offer seem more reasonable to him.
* **Gauging Bob's Response:**  This first offer is as much about getting information as it is about closing a deal. Bob's response will tell me how aggressively I can negotiate in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. How about we bring it down to $600,000 and go from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum ($1,200,000). While I want to negotiate, accepting a price that low would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can get a better deal by countering and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,350,000. This reflects my seriousness while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I decreased my price by $250,000, signaling flexibility but not desperation. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps me well above my $1,200,000 minimum, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""true worth and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of its value and why he was initially interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but we're still quite far apart. I'm serious about this purchase, but it needs to work within my budget.  Could you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, his offer of $700,000 is still significantly below my $1,200,000 floor. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach a more agreeable price.  It's time to push back a bit more firmly and see if he's truly serious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still substantial.  I'm open to finding a solution, but I need to see a more serious offer. To be frank, I have other options for this product, but I believe in its value for you. My final offer is $1,200,000. This is non-negotiable."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my best and final offer. This introduces a sense of urgency and limits further back-and-forth.
* **Transparency and Justification:**  I'm being transparent about having other options (John), which emphasizes that my time is valuable. However, I'm also reiterating my belief in the product's value for Bob, keeping him engaged.
* **No Room for Interpretation:** By stating ""$1,200,000 is non-negotiable,"" I'm eliminating any ambiguity. Bob now knows I'm serious about this being my bottom line.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario - I get my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob Counters Close to $1.2M:**  Indicates strong interest, and I might consider a small concession.
* **Bob Counters Significantly Lower:** Time to seriously consider walking away and selling to John."
