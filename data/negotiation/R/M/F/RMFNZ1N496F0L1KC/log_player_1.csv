Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll receive. Let's start with this figure and see where we can go from there."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify spending a fraction of that.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds left and can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but the gap is still too large.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 just doesn't make sense for me. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I want.  I have 6 rounds left and can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my desired price.  I'm hoping Bob will come up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a substantial discount from my original asking price.  This is a fair offer that acknowledges your budget while also allowing me to recoup a reasonable portion of my investment. Let's make this deal happen. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
