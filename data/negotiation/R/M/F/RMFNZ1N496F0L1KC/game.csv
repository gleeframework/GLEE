"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll receive. Let's start with this figure and see where we can go from there.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify spending a fraction of that.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but the gap is still too large.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 just doesn't make sense for me. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a substantial discount from my original asking price.  This is a fair offer that acknowledges your budget while also allowing me to recoup a reasonable portion of my investment. Let's make this deal happen. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
