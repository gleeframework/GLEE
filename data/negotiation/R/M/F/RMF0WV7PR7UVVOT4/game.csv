"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $120 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway. How about an offer of $135 for the product? This is still above the initial asking price but closer to your suggested amount. I hope this proposal works for you, and I look forward to your feedback.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to that.",130.0,Bob,4,
