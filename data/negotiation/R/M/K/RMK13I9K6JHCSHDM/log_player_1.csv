Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that considers its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

This would still leave you with a substantial profit margin and is a fair compromise given the value I know this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
