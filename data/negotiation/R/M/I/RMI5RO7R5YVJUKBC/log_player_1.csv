Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value and significantly above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down in price. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating its worth to you, phrasing like ""a great deal"" and ""incredibly valuable for you"" subtly implies the product is worth a premium price.
* **Clean Number:** Offering a clean number like $19,000 feels more deliberate than a round number like $20,000.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong fallback position with John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum of $15,000."
