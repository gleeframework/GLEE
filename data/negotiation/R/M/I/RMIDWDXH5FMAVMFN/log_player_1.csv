"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully allows me to get as close to my desired value as possible.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the safety net of John's offer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $950,000 is a good price, but I think I can do better. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still being close to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $960,000 is getting closer to my desired value, I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 965000}
```

I'm going to counter with $965,000. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I think it shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired value, I'm not going to settle for a price below $960,000 just yet. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 960000} 
```

I'm sticking with my previous offer of $960,000. I'm starting to run out of rounds, but I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell to John.  Bob has proven stubborn, and while $950,000 is still a good price, I'm not convinced I can get any closer to my desired value with the limited time left. It's better to secure a guaranteed $800,000 than risk ending up with nothing."
