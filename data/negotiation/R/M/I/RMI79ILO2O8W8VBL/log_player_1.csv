"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counter-offers.  However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or sell to John for $100 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or sell to John for $100 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a little below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
