"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive and friendly tone:**  Keeping the message positive and inviting encourages Bob to engage.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I don't want to immediately shut down the deal, so leaving room for Bob to counter is important. 
* **Focusing on value:**  Mentioning ""amazing product"" subtly reinforces the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I want to close a deal, selling for $8,000 would be a significant loss.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed win, but I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob first.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a great product and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Value reinforcement:**  Again, highlighting the ""great product"" keeps the focus on its worth.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly, encouraging continued negotiation. 
* **Midpoint strategy:**  Offering a midpoint price is a common tactic in negotiations, making it seem like a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to try one more round of negotiation to see if we can get closer to $9,000.  If it doesn't work, I'll move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you about staying within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? This will allow you to get the product at a good price while ensuring I get a fair deal too. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still a bit higher. 
* **Emphasis on win-win:** I'm framing this as a solution that benefits both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is positive and uses language like ""Let's make this happen!"" to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Slight pressure:** By mentioning a ""fair deal"" for myself, I subtly imply that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I need to stay within my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is not willing to budge beyond $8,500. While it's tempting to try one more counteroffer, I'm running out of rounds and need to make a decision. Considering John is willing to pay my minimum, selling to him is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
