Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's still a profitable deal for me. 

This strategy is based on a few factors:

* **Bob's Value:**  I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed backup option with John offering $1,200,000, which gives me leverage.
* **Potential Counteroffers:** By starting high, I leave room for potential counteroffers and negotiation, while still aiming for a strong starting point.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a profitable deal and potentially maximizing my earnings through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000 than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I believe I can secure a higher price through further negotiation. 

* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed backup option with John offering $1,200,000, so I don't need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my expectations.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still potential for Bob to increase his offer. He values the product at $800,000, so there's room for a compromise.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I'm continuing the negotiation process to potentially achieve a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $850,000 with a price of $950,000. This represents a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer and my previous offer.

* **Strategic Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still securing a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Remaining Profitable:** This price is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Balancing Act:** It's a calculated risk. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I might have to consider my options more carefully, but I'm hopeful that this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept."
