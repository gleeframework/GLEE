"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's truly unique and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your company. My starting price is $1,200,000. This reflects the significant value and potential it holds. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's true value and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your ongoing efforts to find a compromise.  $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, but still a bit low for me. Let's try $1,075,000. This would be a reasonable midpoint between our current positions.  I'm confident that with a little more flexibility, we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise again. I'd like to offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is fair, reflects the value of the product, and will allow us to finalize the deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer $1,030,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1030000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $1,030,000 is still too low for me.  This is my final offer - $1,040,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in these negotiations. If we can't agree, I'm prepared to move on to another buyer. ",1040000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I understand that we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your persistence as well. However, $1,040,000 is still a bit above my budget. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree. I'd like to make one final offer of $1,020,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1020000.0,Bob,10,
