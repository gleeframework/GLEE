{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value.  This gives Bob room to counter, but also sets a clear expectation that you're looking for a price close to your minimum.  It's important to be friendly and encouraging to maintain a good relationship with Bob.  

Remember, I can always sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can get closer to $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $9,000. It's still above my minimum but gives him some room to negotiate. I'm being positive and encouraging to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $8750.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but I'm still not willing to drop below $9,000. I'm going to make one more counteroffer and see if I can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? That's a good price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875} 
```

I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. I'm hopeful this will be enough to get Bob to accept. I'm also emphasizing that this is a good price for both of us, which is key to getting Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8500.  Could we agree on that price? It's a fair deal for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his final offer is too far below my minimum.  It's better to sell to John for $10,000 and guarantee my minimum profit.  I'll politely thank Bob for his interest, but let him know I'm going to accept another offer."
