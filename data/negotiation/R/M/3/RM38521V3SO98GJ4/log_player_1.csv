Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that John provides a safety net. Starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection of its worth"" aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potentially higher final sale price than selling directly to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Knowledge:** This strategy assumes Alice has limited knowledge of other potential buyers. If there were other bidders, a more aggressive opening price might be warranted.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice knows Bob is particularly price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective."
