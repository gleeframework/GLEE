"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is more than fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to his maximum.
* **Confidence:**  The message is confident and positive, emphasizing the product's value without being overly aggressive.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone invites Bob's feedback and opens the door for negotiation. 
 
This approach allows Alice to gauge Bob's willingness to pay a high price while leaving options open for adjustments in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and the product's worth to him. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you.  It's crucial to signal that his initial offer is unacceptable and aim for a price closer to your target range. 

Proceeding to the next round allows you to counter-offer and negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message firmly rejects Bob's lowball offer while maintaining a collaborative tone. 
* **Justification:** By stating it's ""significantly below its true value,"" Alice reinforces her position without directly attacking Bob's offer.
* **Compromise:**  The counter-offer of $1,300,000 represents a significant concession from Alice's initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Suggesting a middle ground encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counter-offer.

This approach balances firmness on price with a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slowly increasing, it's still below your absolute minimum of $1,200,000. Accepting would mean settling for less than what John is offering. 

Continuing the negotiation keeps the possibility of exceeding John's offer open. You can afford to be a bit more firm in the next round, as Bob is clearly interested but trying to negotiate a very favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $1,250,000 is my absolute best and final offer. It's a fair deal considering the potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stand:**  Alice clearly states this is her ""absolute best and final offer,"" creating a sense of urgency and limiting further significant concessions.
* **Justification:** Reminding Bob of the product's value and potential reinforces the fairness of the offer despite it being above his current bids.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $1,250,000 is a calculated risk. It's a strong position that slightly exceeds John's offer, providing a small buffer while still being attractive enough to potentially close the deal with Bob.

This approach aims to either secure a deal with Bob at a price exceeding John's offer or prompt a counter-offer closer to Alice's target range."
