"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still above your budget of $8,000. You should attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my highest offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  You should counteroffer again and try to get closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's in your best interest to buy from John.  You've gone through several rounds of negotiation and while Alice is coming down in price, you're getting closer to your maximum budget.  It's likely that you will not be able to get Alice to lower her price to $8,000, and you could risk wasting more time in negotiations. Buying from John guarantees you the product within your budget."
