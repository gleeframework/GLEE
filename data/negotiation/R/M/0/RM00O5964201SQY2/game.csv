"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be open to $9,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment. Considering your offer of $9,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I appreciate that.  However, $10,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
