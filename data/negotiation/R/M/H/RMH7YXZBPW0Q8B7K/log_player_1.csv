"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While $95 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to close the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 just doesn't quite work for me.  How about $98? It's a small step up from your offer, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers.  While $92 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and a lot better than selling to John. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
