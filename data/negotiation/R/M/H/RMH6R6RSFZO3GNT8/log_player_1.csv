Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-offer and how determined he seems to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $17,500. This is still a good price for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to give away the product for a ridiculously low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'll counter with a price closer to my last offer. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that's too far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $16,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offers, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's fair for me.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm also not going to give it away for a price that undervalues it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've already lowered my price significantly and it seems like he's not willing to budge.  I'm not confident that we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. I'm better off selling to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
