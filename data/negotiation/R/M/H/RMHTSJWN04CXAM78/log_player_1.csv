Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $100 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows a willingness to negotiate by asking for his opinion.  This strategy aims to start the negotiation at a favorable price while leaving space for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can come to a more mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I can't go that low.  How about $140?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  John is a guaranteed sale at $150, so I'll go with the sure thing and sell to him."
