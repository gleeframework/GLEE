```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1150000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My final counteroffer is $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,200,000 is exactly your maximum budget.  This means you're not losing any money by accepting, and you're securing the product.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice could walk away and you'd be forced to buy from John at the same price.  Accepting this offer is the most logical and secure choice."
