"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a little above my limit. I'm prepared to offer $1150000. This shows a good faith effort on my part, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1150000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My final counteroffer is $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
