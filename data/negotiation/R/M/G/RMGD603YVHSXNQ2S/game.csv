"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85? I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
