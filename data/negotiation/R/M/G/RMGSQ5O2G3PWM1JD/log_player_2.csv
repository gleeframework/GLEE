"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm starting with a price of $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $100 is too high, so Bob should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we start at $75? "", ""product_price"": 75} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum of $80, but he wants to start lower to give Alice some room to negotiate.  $75 is a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll go down to $85?  This would still be a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $85 is still a bit higher than Bob's target price of $80.  There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $80?  It's fair to both of us, and I can get the product right away."", ""product_price"": 80} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering his maximum price of $80, which is still a good deal for him. This is a strong counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants to get it for the best price possible."
